[21:16] <lordcirth> Guest21456, hi
[21:16] <explosive> lorddoskias1: nope
[21:16] <lorddoskias1> huhz, rather strange indeed
[21:16] <Guest21456> I want to lean about Linux.
[21:16] <lorddoskias1> maybe it depends on the way the rules are executed
[21:16] <explosive> lorddoskias1: try giving it the full path to the bin
[21:17] <lorddoskias1> i have already given it the full path to the bin
[21:17] <explosive> sudo /usr/bin/qemu....
[21:17] <Guest21456> Buy, I don't know how to do it.
[21:17] <explosive> lorddoskias1: no i mean in the actual command
[21:17] <lorddoskias1> i see
[21:17] <Bashing-om> !manual | Guest21456
[21:17] <ubottu> Guest21456: The Ubuntu Manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as surfing the web, listening to music and scanning documents. With an emphasis on easy to follow instructions, it is suitable for all levels of experience. http://ubuntu-manual.org/
[21:17] <lordcirth> Guest21456, I have a link for that, 1 sec
[21:17] <lordcirth> Or that
[21:17] <lorddoskias1> explosive: it worked
[21:18] <explosive> cool (kind of odd though)
[21:18] <lorddoskias1> thanks, but now it works even without the full path
[21:18] <xploshioon> hello, is there anyone that can help me with this? https://gist.github.com/xploshioOn/7fcab2b1619a0c02e568047a96744bb8 is an ubuntu 14.04
[21:18] <explosive> ..plot thickens
[21:18] <Guest21456> :) Bashing-om I have other problem too. I don't know very much English Language.
[21:18] <lorddoskias1> explosive: maybe something got updated by a timeout
[21:19] <Guest21456> I only know Spanish. I'm studying English.
[21:19] <Bashing-om> Guest21456: Just ask .. If I canot understand .. we can direct you to a channel in your native language .
[21:19] <bekks> xploshioon: install the missing libpulse.so.0 library.
[21:20] <explosive> lorddoskias1: maybe
[21:20] <lordcirth> bekks, he appears to have it, that's the question
[21:20] <Anthaas> lordcirth, One of the main contributors to Sublime Text is helping too - he has directed me to the network settings for the package that is failing - there are no proxies set....
[21:20] <lordcirth> xploshioon, perhaps you need the 32bit libpulse?
[21:20] <Anthaas> So where on earth is its attempt at using an old proxy coming from...
[21:21] <bekks> lordcirth: He has a 64bit version of the library.
[21:21] <xploshioon> I installed it and its there but in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/, not in the /usr/lib/
[21:21] <xploshioon> with ldd `which pulseaudio`
[21:21] <lordcirth> xploshioon, you installed it through APT?
[21:22] <bekks> xploshioon: so you installed the 64bit version. What are the requirements of that "Velneo Server"?
[21:22] <xploshioon> its here libpulse.so.0 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpulse.so.0 (0x00007f2304630000)
[21:22] <xploshioon> yes, with apt-get install...
[21:22] <Anthaas> lordcirth, think I have found the problem.
[21:22] <Anthaas> lordcirth, My network proxies are environment variables, ST3 is picking these up at start, and won't remove them unless I remove them from data in python environment.
[21:23] <lordcirth> Anthaas, your proxies are in bash environment variables?
[21:23] <Anthaas> lordcirth, Not by my choosing - this laptop was configured for me by a "technician".
[21:23] <Anthaas> Im a post-grad researcher - apparently we aren't allowed to do this stuff ourselves...
[21:24] <Guest21456> I need a friend native from U.S for practice English Language. I'm foreing and I want to learn your language.
[21:24] <deweydb_> hi, i have some scripts that send system mail.  When i finish reading this mail, i get a message like "Saved 77 messages in mbox".  Where are these saved? when i run 'mail' again it says 'No new mail for username'.  when i look at /var/mail/username the file is there but 0 bytes. so where do these mail's get "saved" to?
[21:24] <Anthaas> lmfao
[21:24] <Anthaas> Charming
[21:24] <lordcirth> Anthaas, Ah, I see.  So, you should be able to do "env - sublime"
[21:25] <lordcirth> Or whatever the ST3 command is
[21:25] <Guest21456> Is there someone that want to be my study partner?
[21:25] <Anthaas> You want someone native from the U.S to practice English - what about English people?
[21:25] <Anthaas> lordcirth, I am not familiar with that?
[21:25] <lordcirth> Anthaas, "run the following command with fresh environment"
[21:25] <lordcirth> That may or may not clear the proxy settings
[21:25] <xploshioon> @bekks there was a lot, it gives me 6 errors untill now, I just installed the missing packages and everything worked, but with this didn't work
[21:25] <lordcirth> depending on where they are set
[21:26] <lordcirth> Otherwise, use "unset" to clear them
[21:26] <bekks> xploshioon: What are the requirements of that "Velneo Server"?
[21:26] <Anthaas> lordcirth, You mean: "env -subl" ?
[21:26] <Guest21456> :(
[21:26] <Guest21456> I only want to learn something.
[21:26] <lordcirth> Guest21456, that is offtopic here, sorry
[21:27] <lordcirth> Anthaas, no, '-' is a complete argument to 'env' in this case
[21:27] <bekks> Guest21456: This is an Ubuntu ssupport channel, maybe you can ask in #ubuntu-de-offtopic
[21:27] <Guest21456> All information about informatic is in English.
[21:28] <Anthaas> Ahh ok
[21:29] <xploshioon> @bekks this is the content of the vServer.sh https://gist.github.com/xploshioOn/7fcab2b1619a0c02e568047a96744bb8
[21:29] <bekks> xploshioon: What are the requirements of that "Velneo Server"?
[21:30] <lordcirth> xploshioon, all that does is exec the ./vServer executable
[21:30] <Anthaas> lordcirth, It works
[21:30] <lordcirth> Anthaas, awesome!
[21:31] <lordcirth> Anthaas, if you would like Sublime to launch from a desktop icon, you can probably edit the .desktop file to have the modified command.,
[21:31] <xploshioon> @bekks, I don't know, how can I know the dependencies?
[21:31] <Anthaas> lordcirth, Thanks man - Im wondering if this would have any other consequences on the running of sublime text though - Im sure not.
[21:32] <bekks> xploshioon: We are not talking about the dependencies. We are talking about the official requirements as published by the author of Velneo Server.
[21:32] <xploshioon> for the moment the error i get is this ./vServer: error while loading shared libraries: libpulse.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[21:32] <Anthaas> I know, for example, sublime text does need to access $PATH
[21:32] <bekks> xploshioon: If you dont know the requirements, look them up please.
[21:35] <lordcirth> Anthaas, $PATH will be correctly set, it's part of the basic stuff.  As for the rest, well, you'll find out :P But I think it will be fine.
[21:37] <HappyHobo> Who is the main op here?  I believe I spoke with them the other day considering a sound issue.
[21:38] <lordcirth> HappyHobo, does your IRC client not keep logs?
[21:38] <k1l> !logs
[21:38] <ubottu> Official channel logs can be found at http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/ . LoCo channels are now logged there too. Meeting logs from meetingology at http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/
[21:38] <Apteryx> My screenlock settings won't stick. No matter what I do in the Unity settings. Anything I should look into?
[21:39] <lordcirth> Oh right I forgot there was official logging
[21:39] <HappyHobo> I don't remember who it was lordcirth so I don't know who to look for.  I spoke with a few people that day.  I need to apologize and get banned.
[21:39] <lordcirth> wat
[21:39] <lordcirth> HappyHobo, well, just look through the logs looking for your own name, and you'll find it
[21:39] <bekks> HappyHobo: So you can search the logs.
[21:39] <HappyHobo> Was it you lordcirth?
[21:40] <lordcirth> HappyHobo, I doubt it, as I remember nothing.
=== norm is now known as Guest43961
[21:40] <HappyHobo> Demmit.
[21:40] <tgm4883> one wonders why you need the "main op"
[21:40] <HappyHobo> I've been feeling guilty for days now.
[21:40] <k1l> HappyHobo: either you look into the logs the bot just linked you or you just ask your technical question :)
[21:41] <HappyHobo> I realize I will be banned and I expect that.  I respect that decision but before I do I want to apologize.
[21:42] <nacc> ... is this a guilty spamming situation? like you are going to apologize and then spam the channel, HappyHobo?
[21:43] <HappyHobo> I am running chatelOS which is xubuntu with scripts in opt that are more than tied in than I thought.  I didn't realized how much they are tied in to the other night.  Prior to this I thought it was mostly xubuntu and I should get help here.  Well it really isn't and I am very sorry.
[21:43] <nacc> HappyHobo: i don't think you'd get banned for asking a question in the wrong channel ...
[21:43] <tgm4883> HappyHobo: so you lied the other day about running Xubuntu and wasted a bunch of people's time?
[21:44] <HappyHobo> Those scripts in opt have nothing to do with audio but still chatelos is chatelos not xubuntu.
[21:44] <HappyHobo> Those scripts only affect style and theming but not audio.
[21:44] <HappyHobo> So I was kind of right but mostly wrong for my fraud.
[21:45] <HappyHobo> tgm4883:  YOU ARE HIM!  DUDE I AM SO SORRY.
[21:45] <tgm4883> HappyHobo: sounds like you were completely wrong and reinforced why the rules exist in this channel
[21:45] <HappyHobo> You can ban me now.
[21:45] <LaylaStorm> Lol
[21:46] <tgm4883> HappyHobo: I don't think it was me... and I'm not going to ban you
[21:46] <HappyHobo> I need to be banned.
[21:46] <tgm4883> HappyHobo: why?
[21:46] <LaylaStorm> XD
[21:46] <k1l> HappyHobo: ok, thanks  for apologizing. now please lets focus on ubuntu support again in here.
[21:47] <HappyHobo> If not I'll just sit here and glean without asking another question.  I feel guilty though.
[21:47] <HappyHobo> I need revolution.
[21:47] <LaylaStorm> LOL
[21:47] <LaylaStorm> This guy is hilarious..

[21:53] <blinkyb> guys i have problem installing Budgie http://pastebin.com/JbXawrSh i get this, i''ve tried everything but no luch
[21:54] <k1l> blinkyb: sudo apt install budgie-core
[21:56] <HappyHobo> sudo apt install aptitude first which would seem to be the better choice in resolving this problem then sudo aptitude install budgie-core just saying

[21:57] <blinkyb> k1l: "The Following Packages have unmet dependencies" "Unable to correct problems, you have broken packages"
[21:57] <bekks> HappyHobo: Why would aptitude resolve problems "better"?
[21:57] <nacc> hrm, why would one want to run packages from a PPA that announces it is deprecated?
[21:57] <bekks> HappyHobo: The way to go nowadays is "apt".
[21:57] <k1l> blinkyb: please put all the outpu into a pastebin
[21:57] <blinkyb> k1l: budgie-core : Depends : libmutter0g
[21:57] <blinkyb> ok
[21:57] <HappyHobo> It breaks loops and dependency issues better in my opinion still.
[21:58] <bekks> HappyHobo: Better than apt? Did you try?
[21:58] <HappyHobo> I have using ubuntu mate trying to get icewm
[21:58] <blinkyb> k1l: http://pastebin.com/A3yvBp44
[21:59] <bekks> HappyHobo: Did you compare apt and aptitude?
[21:59] <nacc> blinkyb: why are you using that ppa rather than https://launchpad.net/~budgie-remix/+archive/ubuntu/ppa ?
[21:59] <blinkyb> nacc: i am completely new to this, dont know really
[21:59] <nacc> blinkyb: i only ask because the ppa you are using explicitly says to use the other one...
[21:59] <nacc> https://launchpad.net/~fossfreedom/+archive/ubuntu/budgie-desktop
[21:59] <nacc> not sure why you wouldn't follow their advice :)
[21:59] <nacc> blinkyb: ok, i'd try with the recommended path, if nothing else
[21:59] <blinkyb> nacc: so which sudo should i use?
[22:00] <HappyHobo> I was trapped in a loop.  It showed 3 dependencies using apt and it showed when I tried to installed this dependency it said it couldn't because of the other dependency then tried that one it said the one before back and forth until I tried aptitude which just fixed it.
[22:00] <nailsom> Boa noite
[22:00] <bekks> HappyHobo: Did you compare apt and aptitude?
[22:00] <HappyHobo> Yes bekks
[22:00] <nacc> blinkyb: since you tried to use the deprecated PPA to start, follow the instructions at https://launchpad.net/~fossfreedom/+archive/ubuntu/budgie-desktop
[22:01] <nacc> blinkyb: under 'PPA description'
[22:01] <HappyHobo> the two are so similar but they aren't.
[22:01] <nailsom> alguem conhece o Droidcam?
[22:01] <nacc> blinkyb: you'll need to add the newer ppa and purge the old ppa
[22:01] <nacc> blinkyb: i'm not saying this because i know it will work, though, i'm saying what the relevant maintainers are recommending on their page
[22:02] <HappyHobo> I've dreamed of a day when aptitude was installed by default and there was a gui to use it.

[22:02] <bekks> HappyHobo: And you are not mixing up apt-get and apt, are you?
[22:02] <HappyHobo> I don't believe so bekks.
[22:02] <HappyHobo> Aren't apt and apt-get the same thing?\
[22:03] <tgm4883> If they were the same thing, we wouldn't call them different things...
[22:03] <lordcirth> HappyHobo, no, they are different programs which do the same things
[22:03] <lordcirth> In slightly different ways
[22:04] <lordcirth> 'apt' being the most recent
[22:04] <HappyHobo> Good googa mooga.  I'm sorry.  I thought apt and apt-get were the same thing.  I thought the only alternative being aptitude.
[22:04]  * HappyHobo has egg on his face.
[22:05] <lordcirth> And, the package management system, in general, is called "APT".  Confusing, I know.
[22:06] <blinkyb> nacc: same error
[22:06] <HappyHobo> apt, apt-get, aptitude all install but each does it in its own way all resolving dependencies and such in a unique way
[22:06] <HappyHobo> Is there another?
[22:07]  * stormchaser3000 just figured out why he can't use his nvidia graphics card :(
[22:07] <lordcirth> HappyHobo, well, dpkg is a basic tool for installing individual packages.  then there are the gui tools, some of which use aptitude or dpkg under the hood.
[22:07] <lordcirth> stormchaser3000, why's that?
[22:07] <stormchaser3000> i have to have windows installed to switch from my intel graphics card to my nvidia graphics card as it is not possible to switch them through the bios menu
[22:07] <stormchaser3000> >:(
[22:07] <tgm4883> lordcirth: wouldn't that be dpkg no APT?
[22:08] <HappyHobo> So no one uses aptitude anymore?
[22:08]  * HappyHobo is feeling old and odd.
[22:09] <bekks> HappyHobo: Basically, thats correct. :)
[22:09] <lestus> HappyHobo: same..
[22:09] <lestus> HappyHobo: wouldn't happen to be your birthday?
[22:10] <lordcirth> tgm4883, as I understood it, APT is the standard, which dpkg implements?
[22:10] <HappyHobo> Nope, still feeling old.
[22:10] <lestus> HappyHobo: whic of the three do you prefer
[22:10] <HappyHobo> dpkg-reconfigure things fixes things like say you have gdm and lightdm and you watch to switch
[22:10] <hggdh> lestus, HappyHobo: please stop with the non-support chat in this channel. User -offtopic, or -discuss for that
[22:11] <HappyHobo> want to switch
[22:11] <nacc> lordcirth: .deb is the standard, dpkg knows how to install them; apt is a management interfaace over dpkg
[22:11] <lestus> hggdh: already did
[22:11] <HappyHobo> I still prefer aptitude even though it is cli.
[22:11] <HappyHobo> hggdh:  I am on topic.
[22:12] <hggdh> HappyHobo: no, you are not. You are giving out an opinion. You are actually repeating the same opinion again and again. Please stop.
[22:13] <HappyHobo> I thought I was. sorry hggdh
[22:13] <lordcirth> #ubuntu channel is unusually specific, being focused only on support, where most distro channels allow most distro-related chat.  Presumably because Ubuntu has so much more traffic.

[22:14] <lestus> lordcirth: yea that's certainly unusual, they forgot the 'community' element of support?

[22:58] <mustmodify> as does sudo ls /var/log/nginx/*
[22:58] <mustmodify> ???
[22:58] <lordcirth> mustmodify, iirc, globbing is done by bash, which in this case is running as you, and passing the expansion to 'sudo ls'

[22:59] <tgm4883> lordcirth: +1
[22:59] <lordcirth> mustmodify, try "sudo -s" then " ls /var/log/nginx/* "
[22:59] <lordcirth> Just remember to exit the root shell when you are done.
[23:00] <mustmodify> yeah, that's what I just did.
[23:00] <mustmodify> lordcirth: good thinking.

[23:28] <abhishek> hi guys!
[23:28] <abhishek> I was getting some errors on boot
[23:29] <abhishek> checking the log file: abhishek log $ ls -lh syslog -rw-r----- 1 syslog adm 5.3G Jun  8 04:57 syslog
[23:29] <abhishek> Is this normal for log to be so huge?
[23:29] <lordcirth> abhishek, that is pretty big.
[23:29] <reisio> not really, not unless it's from 20 years back
[23:29] <reisio> your logging level is probably absurd and/or something is erroring out 24/7
[23:29] <lordcirth> Doesn't Ubuntu have logrotate by default?
[23:30]  * reisio shrugs
[23:30] <reisio> you know about logrotate, so it doesn't really matter if it has it by default
[23:30] <reisio> rotation isn't deletion, anyway
[23:30] <abhishek> lordcirth, Not that I aware of. I am using kubuntu 16.04
[23:30] <lordcirth> Yes but it would be a separate file.
[23:30] <lordcirth> abhishek, well, use tail and find out what's spamming it
[23:31] <abhishek> lordcirth, it taking too long for tail.
[23:31] <lordcirth> heh
[23:31] <abhishek> it=it's
[23:31] <lordcirth> Yeah, it will have to read 5.3GB off the disk, I guess.  There should be a tool that skips that
[23:32] <abhishek> lordcirth, you know any?
[23:32] <lordcirth> It will do it, though, and 5.3GB shouldn't take more than a few minutes
[23:32] <lordcirth> I do not
[23:33] <abhishek> should I remove the logfile and rerun to check errors?
[23:33] <abhishek> rerun-reboot
[23:33] <reisio> removing or moving the log file would fix the space issue
[23:33] <lordcirth> abhishek, I would move it, instead
[23:33] <reisio> you'll have to investigate to know why it's so large
[23:33] <reisio> to prevent it in future
[23:33] <lordcirth> move to syslog.old
[23:33] <lordcirth> Moves, thankfully, are instant

[23:35] <lordcirth> Kimish, when you try to log in, what happens?  It just drops you back to a log in screen?
[23:36] <lordcirth> abhishek, syslog generally records constantly
[23:36] <Kimish> Lordcirth : exactly
[23:36] <lordcirth> Kimish, hit Ctrl-Alt-F2 and login
[23:37] <lordcirth> Then read /var/log/Xorg.0.log to find out what broke
[23:37] <Kimish> Lordcirth: done !
[23:37] <lordcirth> Kimish, are you reading the log?
[23:39] <Kimish> What log am in a shell now am loged from shell i want to login to desktop
[23:39] <abhishek> lordcirth, I cleaned and check again. This is what I got https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1588428/comments/10

[23:39] <Kimish> Lordcirth; ??
[23:39] <lordcirth> Kimish, read your X log with: " less /var/log/Xorg.0.log "
[23:39] <lordcirth> Kimish, so you know what broke, and you can fix it
[23:40] <Kimish> Ok
[23:41] <lordcirth> Kimish, look for the last error (EE), generally
[23:43] <abhishek> any ideas on the issue?
[23:43] <lordcirth> abhishek, doesn't look good.  Sounds like a PCI device is misbehaving, repeatedly
[23:46] <lordcirth> abhishek, looking at the bug, did the pci=nomsi workaround prevent the log spam?
[23:47] <Kimish> Lordcirth : yes there are so many errors infront of (EE)
[23:47] <abhishek> lordcirth, what does that do? Does it just tell the kernel to stop logging?
[23:48] <lordcirth> abhishek, I have no idea, I just saw it on the bug report.
[23:48] <lordcirth> Kimish, pastebin the log file for us.

[23:50] <Kimish> Lordcirth its too long and am in my phone now
[23:50] <abhishek> lordcirth, the guy in the bug report told me to remove it. Though it fixed the issue. I think it just stops logging. I rather fix the issue.
[23:51] <lordcirth> Kimish, the computer with the error doesn't have internet?
[23:51] <Kimish> Yes it doesnt
[23:52] <lordcirth> Kimish, ok.  Well, look for the last error, since that is generally the one that caused the crash.
[23:53] <Kimish> Lordcirth ; have u seen the first error it has smt to do dith nvidia ???
[23:54] <lordcirth> Kimish, yeah, it didn't find the nvidia proprietary driver, so it goes on to the next one, as normal.
[23:56] <abhishek> what is ideally I should do in this situation?
[23:56] <abhishek> Is it related to kernel, should I ask there?

[00:02] <KILLME1> I f***ed up pretty bad...I was using dd to write an iso to a usb (the iso was 3.6G) and acciddentaly overwrote my main partition which was dm-luks encrypted. It's still on, I'm currently looking at my xfce desktop but I can't do sh**. How do I either save my OS or export all my important stuff to another storage device??
[00:02] <sruli> i need a some help with a little bash script i have for iptables, the script inserts rules for iptables  V 4 & 6 so i execute 'for V in 4 6; do ip${V}tables' i have a function to remove the  '4' when it populates the rules for iptables v4 ip4tables() {iptables $@} however it doesnt seem to remove the '4' can anyone help me out here please?
[00:04] <sruli> KILLME1: is the machine frozen?
[00:04] <KILLME1> not entirely conky is still running and whisker-menu still works but can't access a file manager
[00:04] <KILLME1> or a terminal
[00:05] <sruli> KILLME1: can u view the files with ls in terminal?
[00:05] <lordcirth> Ctrl-Alt-F2, maybe?
[00:05] <lordcirth> ttys should be in RAM
[00:06] <lordcirth> you might be able to copy data using utilities that don't happen to be in the wrong 3.6GB or are cached
[00:06] <KILLME1> yeah Ctrl-Alt-F2 brings me to the login, I can type but will not login
[00:06] <lordcirth> great
[00:07] <lordcirth> This would be the "load backups" phase
[00:07] <lordcirth> Which I'm guessing you don't have
[00:07] <sruli> KILLME1: the first 5 workds u wrtoe sums it up... i feel ur pain, been there
[00:08] <KILLME1> you mean previous backups of the system? Yeah should have done that *facepalm
[00:08] <tgm4883> Sounds like it overwrote credentials, which since you can't open a terminal and it's an encrypted partition probably means game over
[00:09] <OerHeks> what bothers me, can one dd to an mounted encrypted partition/disk..
[00:09] <tgm4883> unless you have a backup of your luks headers, then maybe you could do something with that
[00:09] <lordcirth> OerHeks, dd works on files, some of which happen to be block devices.  Not part of it's mandate to look for mounts
[00:09] <sruli> is there a chance the luks headers have not been overwritten and still poss to back it up?
[00:10] <tgm4883> OerHeks: why not? dd is a pretty powerful tool, and it's reasons exactly like this why we have tools for making USB bootable stuff that isn't dd
[00:10] <Kimish> Lordcirth : (EE) screen0 deleted because of no matching config section " and before that "(EE) open /dev/fb0: no such file or directory"  what do u think is the problem ?????
[00:10] <KILLME1> well my boot partition was exactly 100MB and the iso was 3.6. I think it might have overwritten the headers but idk
[00:10] <tgm4883> sruli: not likely, but possibly worth a shot
[00:10] <lordcirth> sruli, seeing as he dd'd 3.6GB from the beginning, it's gone, assuming it's the first partition on the drive
[00:11] <lordcirth> KILLME1, and your / was right after /boot?  Yeah it's gone.
[00:11] <tgm4883> lordcirth: I was on the assumption he wrote to the disk, not the partition
[00:11] <tgm4883> but yea, gone either way
[00:11] <KILLME1> oh sorry yeah disk
[00:12] <KILLME1> I did sudo dd if=file.iso of=/dev/sda bs-1M
[00:12] <Kimish> Lordcirth; ????
[00:12] <KILLME1> bs=1M*
[00:13] <lordcirth> Kimish, ok, what graphics card do you have, and what driver were you using prior to it breaking?
[00:13] <tgm4883> KILLME1: it's times like this that a relevant yet unhelpful (post-dataloss) saying comes to mind. "If your data isn't backed up, it's not important"
[00:13] <KILLME1> lesson learned fml
[00:14] <tgm4883> KILLME1: yep, I think we've all been there at one point or another, missing something that we didn't back up
[00:14] <sruli> can anyone help me with a little bash script i have for iptables, the script inserts rules for iptables  V 4 & 6 so i execute 'for V in 4 6; do ip${V}tables' i have a function to remove the  '4' when it populates the rules for iptables v4 ip4tables() {iptables $@} however it doesnt seem to remove the '4' can anyone help me out here please?

[01:14] <somsip> jn_jn: that's something you may need unity support about then
[01:14] <lordcirth> jn_jn, are you sure this is linux/ubuntu specific?  Sounds like a Unity thing to me
[01:15] <jn_jn> lordcirth, yep isn't a unity bug
[01:15] <somsip> oct14732: something like this might be relevant? http://homepage.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/Jan.Holthuis/misc/uefi-madness/
[01:15] <jn_jn> sorry isn't a ubuntu bug

[01:16] <somsip> jn_jn: it's unsupported (here) and beta software. Issues are to be expected, but I know that's not helpful as such. Try unity support

[01:17] <_CoolGuy_> Is becoming a software architect a big deal?
[01:17] <oct14732> somsip, I'm not even trying to dual-boot windows. Just hoping to install 16.04
[01:17] <lordcirth> _CoolGuy_, yes, generally.  Why?
[01:18] <_CoolGuy_> I don't know.
[01:18] <oct14732> lordcirth, do you think that the issue is that I'm trying to install an OS that's too recent? Should I downgrade to 12.05?
[01:19] <lordcirth> oct14732, I doubt that's the problem, Ubuntu stable releases are supposed to work on all reasonable hardware
[01:19] <somsip> oct14732: the section 'some very bad uefi implementations' suggests that this laptop uses a very bad uefi implementation. Also noted later with "or HP for putting such a crappy UEFI implementation "
[01:20] <_CoolGuy_> can a software project run without a software architect?
[01:20] <oct14732> is a UEFI implementation something that can be changed?

[01:22] <oct14732> okay, I'll start looking into BIOS--in the meantime, anyone have any suggestions about that error message?

[01:23] <oct14732> I've completely wiped windows off the computer as well, and I haven't put any of my data on there as well--I've reinstalled Ubuntu onto the hard drive multiple times--nothing seems to fix this error
[01:24] <lordcirth> oct14732, boot from the installer, install smartmontools, and check the SMART health of the hard drive.
[01:24] <tgm4883> oct14732: I'd see if there is a bios/uefi update
[01:26] <somsip> oct14732: missed the error message first time I read your question.

[01:26] <lordcirth> somsip, but I think if you need to use boot-repair-disk right after install, something is wrong.
[01:27] <somsip> lordcirth: oh yes.

[01:31] <administrador> Hello. does anyone knows how to make a Windows USB for installation? I just cant find the right, way, I formated my USB to NTFS, FAT32 and still get this error message http://pastebin.com/qkV7fNsq
[01:31] <ParlorMa> Anyone using Steam (Game: Unturned) ?
[01:31] <somsip> administrador: we dont support windows here, but try rufus. My last word on this.
[01:31] <somsip> ParlorMa: what's your real question?
[01:32] <ParlorMa> somsip, game crashes while Loading (start up) - was curious if someone had some experience with it here. Since I can't find much on Google yet
[01:32] <Guest23179> @administrador open disks, go to your usb, restore image, select the iso
[01:32] <somsip> ParlorMa: can you provide error messages
[01:32] <dax> Guest23179: doesn't work.
[01:32] <Guest23179> will erase your hard disk
[01:32] <dax> administrador: There is no supported method for making Windows USB disks from non-Windows systems.
[01:32] <Guest23179> i mean usb
[01:32] <ParlorMa> and Steam Community (discussions) have many posts but not replies with fixes
[01:33] <oct14732> okay, i'm running boot-repair right now. hopefully that fixes the problem.
[01:33] <ParlorMa> somsip, one moment
[01:33] <dax> administrador: #ubuntu also does not help with ISOs you get from interesting places on the internet
[01:33] <somsip> ParlorMa: well, I know nothing about steam so cant help personally. Just trying to get you to a stage where someone might be able to help
[01:33] <Guest23179> I need help with zoiper having delays with dragging the main window all around the desktop. It tends to lag.
[01:34] <Guest23179> Or rather it doesn't "clip" properly on the mouse cursor
[01:34] <somsip> !info zoiper | Guest23179 (is it supported here?)
[01:34] <ubottu> Guest23179 (is it supported here?): Package zoiper does not exist in xenial
[01:34] <ParlorMa> somsip, http://pastebin.com/uPzWVYW0 that's the error message if I try to run it directly. (I appreciate it, though I don't expect much...)
[01:35] <lordcirth> ParlorMa, a textbook unhelpful error message, I'm afraid.
[01:35] <lordcirth> ParlorMa, does the game have a log?
[01:35] <ParlorMa> lordcirth, tried to search for it - but no luck yet... I'll look again
[01:36] <somsip> ParlorMa: I assume Unturned is the game you're trying to play? If steam works with other games, seems like Unturned publishers have done a Bad Thing
[01:37] <mint1234> Does every "checking for ..." have to result in "yes" when executing ./configure script?
[01:37] <somsip> mint1234: no

[01:38] <mint1234> somsip: thank you
[01:39] <administrador> somsip, Well, I am in Ubuntu 14.04, does Ubuntu does basic stuff like making a Windows bootable USB?
[01:39] <lordcirth> Or, you know, not installing windows
[01:39] <XinZhao> somsip; I didnt bring it up someone else was talking about it ;D
[01:39] <somsip> XinZhao: you continued it, and now you're being asked politely to stop
[01:39] <ParlorMa> somsip, lordcirth - it's true, the devs must have done something wrong... Another game I installed works just fine. Anyway appreciate the feedback (As for the log... no luck)
[01:39] <lordcirth> administrador, Windows USB format is not basic, it is undocumented and unstandardized.

[01:40] <N8TheGr8_> Hello all! Can anyone help me with an installation issue I'm having? I'm trying to get to learn how to use Linux properly, however I cannot seem to get it to install alongside Windows 10. My BIOS is UEFI but Alienware seems to have installed the OS as EFI....
[01:41] <XinZhao> !ot lordcirth

[01:41] <XinZhao> At least my tip was actually interesting ;D
[01:41] <XinZhao> "USB FORMATS"
[01:41] <XinZhao> zzzZzz
[01:41] <dax> N8TheGr8_: what's the actual issue you're seeing while trying to install Ubuntu
[01:41] <XinZhao> N8TheGr8_; Windows 10 installed by default that way? weird..
[01:41] <XinZhao> You can do a clean install
[01:41] <tgm4883> ParlorMa: what's the output of "uname -a"
[01:41] <dax> XinZhao: (your connection lagged, all your messages just appeared at once, so the floodbot thwacked you)
[01:42] <dax> and as far as throwing !ot around goes, i think we all got the point and can stop poking at each other now
[01:42] <tgm4883> lol
[01:42] <tgm4883> dax: you're assuming he didn't do that on purpose?
[01:42] <Jordan_U> N8TheGr8_: There is no such thing as installing Windows for "EFI" as opposed to UEFI. What problem are you having specifically?
[01:42] <XinZhao> Nah I am just an enter fiend. You should see my blog xD
[01:42] <XinZhao> Ill try to keep it succinct <3
[01:42] <dax> tgm4883: correct, because it would make no sense and I assume good faith
[01:43] <dax> XinZhao: you sent 7 lines in one second ;)
[01:43] <ParlorMa> tgm4883, it's linux-wide, not specifically ubuntu - just saying
[01:43] <dax> anyways
[01:43] <N8TheGr8_> They installed Win8 on it originally, but my system is set to use UEFI with legacy oproms. When I run the installer I don't see the option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows. When I created a partition for Ubuntu, it would only successfully boot into Win10, Ubuntu never showed
[01:43] <XinZhao> dax; oh, that sucks, I thought id fixed my lag spikes with my new router ;((
[01:43] <tgm4883> ParlorMa: mostly I was asking since I just found a thread saying if you have a 32-bit OS that the game crashes on startup
[01:43] <N8TheGr8_> I'm sure I did something incorrectly, hence why I came here for help (which is much appreciated!)
[01:43] <XinZhao> N8TheGr8_; Well that explains it, Win8 was often installed that way.
[01:43] <ParlorMa> tgm4883, ah no... x64 here. I'll try google again...
[01:44] <N8TheGr8_> XinZhao oof...I fear a reinstall is headed my way?
[01:44] <teegee> hi
[01:44] <administrador> teegee, Hi :)
[01:45] <teegee> I set up a bridge on my 16.04 and am trying to configure the dns server but it won't accept it. I put dns-nameservers into /etc/network/interfaces and tried setting it via nmcli -p c modify br0 ipv4.dns but nothing works
[01:46] <tgm4883> ParlorMa: maybe try a newer (beta) or older (classic) or ancient (antique) veresion http://steamcommunity.com/app/304930/discussions/3/535151589888703229/
[01:46] <teegee> I can modify /etc/resolv.conf but it'll be overwritten on boot?
[01:46] <Zhao> grrr
[01:46] <administrador> Guest23179. thx for the advice, it looks like all files from the ISO are in the USB, I'll reboot now.
[01:47] <Zhao> how is it even with fibre and a $500 router im still getting dropouts
[01:47] <N8TheGr8_> Lmao is that you, Xin?
[01:47] <Zhao> this is not a thing that is supposed to happen
[01:47] <Jordan_U> N8TheGr8_: Please pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l".
[01:47] <N8TheGr8_> Hrm...I'm not able to get into Ubuntu...should I boot into the live version?
[01:48] <N8TheGr8_> (From USB)
[01:48] <Zhao> oh wait, windows 10 decided to ignore my ethernet connection and use wifi instead -_-
[01:49] <Jordan_U> N8TheGr8_: Yes.
[01:49] <N8TheGr8_> Alrighty, I'll have to disappear for a bit
[01:49] <lordcirth> teegee, resolvconf will overwrite it, yes.  Look for /etc/resolvconf
[01:50] <teegee> lordcirth: yes, I found that. it says it'll be overwritten too
[01:50] <teegee> lordcirth: at least all the bits in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/
[01:51] <teegee> lordcirth: or should I put it in the "tail"?
[01:51] <tgm4883> teegee: in tail
[01:52] <teegee> and ifdown, ifup will load the changes?
[01:52] <teegee> alright, let's reboot
[01:52] <lordcirth> teegee, not for dns.  systemctl restart networking
[01:52] <lordcirth> or a reboot, ofc
[01:53] <teegee> ifdown; ifup made it work
[01:53] <tgm4883> teegee: "resolvconf -u"
[01:54] <teegee> why won't it accept the dns-nameserver line in interfaces?
=== fritz is now known as Guest44191
[01:54] <lordcirth> teegee, Ubuntu Desktop does weird things with networking.  Ubuntu Server uses /etc/network/interfaces quite cleanly.
[01:55] <teegee> lordcirth: I think I started with a server install but then I put the lubuntu package on. What do I have now? server or desktop?
[01:55] <OerHeks> weird? just disable networkmanager ..
[01:55] <OerHeks> or setup networkmanager correct
[01:55] <lordcirth> ^
[01:55] <tgm4883> I wouldn't call it weird, network manager is managing the network connection
[01:56] <tgm4883> so if you want to put in custom DNS servers, put it in network manager
[01:56] <OerHeks> if you don't disable it, you script against a tiger :-D
[01:56] <lordcirth> It would be more precise to say, things my server-focused self does not know.
[01:56] <teegee> tgm4883: I tried that with the nmcli
[01:57] <tgm4883> teegee: you couldn't add DNS servers via nmcli?
[01:57] <ParlorMa> tgm4883, funny thing - I used SimpleScreenRec because something was popping up and I couldn't see it. Turns out the games loads to the StartScreen then the window closes & another one (black) opens up.
[01:57] <teegee> tgm4883: I could but it didn't seem to use it
[01:58]  * tgm4883 goes back to read the original question
[01:58] <teegee> tgm4883: it showed up in nmcli -p c show br0 but host wouldn't look up anything

[01:58] <ParlorMa> anyway, disregard my problem - prioritize other people instead ^_^
[01:58] <N8TheGr8> Hello, I'm back! What was the command that someone wanted me to run? :O
[01:58] <teegee> (it does now btw)
[01:58] <tgm4883> teegee: ah a bridge interface, I'm not sure that's in the scope of nm
[01:58] <teegee> ParlorMa: sorry for interfering
[01:59] <teegee> tgm4883: ic. I'll accept that and live on happily since it's working now.
[01:59] <teegee> Thanks for you help everyone
[01:59] <OerHeks> bridge can be done .. http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/man5/nmcli-examples.5.html
[02:01] <N8TheGr8> XinZhao, are you still here buddy?
[02:01] <teegee> I'm setting the bridge up in /etc/network/interfaces so I assumed I can just use it to configure the dns too
[02:02] <teegee> I only tried doing it with nm afterwards when it wasn't working
[02:02] <OerHeks> now you know why
[02:02] <teegee> because when we assume we make an ass out of u and me?
[02:03] <OerHeks> no, if we explain it right, you pass it on correctly
[02:04] <OerHeks> saves us a lot of time

[02:10] <_44trent> so i don't know if this is a good idea, but i'm trying to downgrade xorg to 1.17 so i can get fglrx to work on 16.04
[02:10] <_44trent> how would i go about doing that?
[02:10] <tgm4883> _44trent: no, that would not be a good idea I think
[02:11] <OerHeks> you will end up with 14.04.4
[02:12] <lordcirth> _44trent, have you tried the new "amdgpu" driver?
[02:12] <lordcirth> or radeonsi
[02:13] <_44trent> can't use AMDGPU on an R9 390 :/
[02:14] <lordcirth> _44trent, Gentoo wiki seems to disagree with you: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Amdgpu
[02:14] <_44trent> well, actually
[02:14] <dax> downgrading xorg in 16.04 is a terrible idea
[02:14] <_44trent> yeah if i compile my own kernel
[02:14] <dax> if you don't like the default driver in 16.04 for your card, your decent options are: 1) don't use 16.04, or 2) put up with it and see if a solution comes out at some point
[02:15] <dax> and by "decent" i mean things that will not break your system and render it unsupportable
[02:15] <_44trent> so what you're suggesting is i go to 14.04 or 15.10?
[02:15] <OerHeks> 15.10 support ends with a month
[02:15] <_44trent> ...so the previous LTS?
[02:16] <dax> i'd go with option (2) to be honest. 15.10 is only supported for nine months from release (so not long), and 14.04 is old and you can't use HWE because it'll end up with xenial xorg soon
[02:16] <_44trent> i'll just take a third option and get AMDGPU to work on R9 390
[02:17] <_44trent> all it requires it something enabled in the kernel...
[02:17] <_44trent> kernel upgrades are kind of risky though...
[02:17] <dax> if it involves kernel recompilation, #ubuntu doesn't support it. good luck, though
[02:17] <lordcirth> _44trent, Ubuntu generally keeps past kernels around
[02:17] <dax> (i do not know whether it does involve kernel recompilation, i haven't looked into it)
[02:18] <_44trent> yeah, it requires kernel recompilation. the gentoo wiki and arch wiki have good documentation on it

[02:34] <Guest95904> And say's its for allow remote administrators to login to the machine to do such things as apply patches, defrags, and other administrative tasks
[02:35] <Guest95904> But what exactly is the hardware for it / what hardware triggers it uses
[02:35] <OerHeks> Guest95904, how is this related to ubuntu support?
[02:35] <OerHeks> try the ##hardware channel
[02:35] <Guest95904> its part of the ubuntu os
[02:36] <jamesd> Guest95904: my guess its for the ilom, or a group of iloms so tools could allowed to orcestrate the install over pathes on 100's or 1000's or even 10's of thousands of boxes, i think HP latest servers support it.
[02:36] <tgm4883> Guest95904: no, it's part of your intel processor/chipset. It's not generally used in home applications. Further, among privacy experts, it's considered a security risk
[02:38] <Guest95904> where is it used and how does it work .
[02:38] <Guest95904> remote administration why would that need an interrupt
[02:38] <jamesd> think google or amazon clouds, where they need to patch many boxes at once. but frankly MC would do a better job and safer.
[02:38] <Guest95904> so your saying is it part of the cpu internals or on the motherboard
[02:39] <tgm4883> Guest95904: yes
[02:39] <jamesd> cpu internals, that is accessed by the ilom ( out of band management)
[02:39] <Guest95904> ilom ?
[02:40] <tgm4883> Guest95904: https://libreboot.org/faq/#intelme
[02:41] <deadmund> I just installed kubuntu-desktop and purged unity, but when I boot my system I just got a black screen (no login manager) what should I do?
[02:42] <jamesd> Guest95904: its basicly a small computer insdiet the big one that monitors the big computer and allows you to see the console over a web interface, and crates virtual cdrom so you can install the system from anywhere.
[02:42] <jamesd> inside
[02:42] <deadmund> I can switch to TTY1 and run commands
[02:43] <lordcirth> deadmund, install sddm?  I think that's what Kubuntu 16.04 uses
[02:43] <deadmund> lordcirth: I installed it and I will reboot.  I was using lightdm I think (I have been working without taking a lot of care to what commands I've been running)
[02:44] <Guest95904> so won't that be a privacy issue since a hacker or somebody could uses it to monitor all of what your doing on your own computer
[02:44] <tgm4883> Guest95904: well yes
[02:44] <lordcirth> Guest95904, yes, if they can get in, or steal Intel's backdoor keys
[02:44] <tgm4883> Guest95904: I mean, they would need to gain access to it first
[02:44] <Guest95904> I guess what was the many purpose for it or the big benifit for the addition
[02:44] <tgm4883> Guest95904: you'd have to ask Intel
[02:45] <deadmund> I installed sddm, tested the sytem, no luck. I purged and reins
[02:45] <deadmund> Seems to be working fine.  Moving on
[02:45] <deadmund> lordcirth: Thanks!
[02:46] <lordcirth> deadmund, cool.  np.
[02:46] <jamesd> Guest95904: if you tie into the ilom, you can have pre-shared keys so everything sent accross the wire is encrypted, and you can use firewalls to keep traffic off the network and ilom traffic is supposed to limited to system management only no internet.
[02:46] <Guest95904> has any home users ever used it or does the any os kernel uses this its on an irq a LKM does exist  mei and mei_me
[02:46] <Guest95904> so the os must have some uses for it
[02:46] <samy87> hello
[02:47] <tgm4883> jamesd: you can use the IME to gain access to the desktop session as well
[02:47] <jamesd> Guest95904: no a home user would use it, its faster to have windows updater or apt-get update/upgrade take care of it.  and most home users don't create there own packages.. so no real reason not to use the OS provided tools
[02:48] <jamesd> tgm4883: yeap probably helps some hell desk people.
[02:48] <samy87> for the life of me i cannot delete a folder even as root. i have checked lsof, restarted the server many times. shutdown all services with no avail. I keep getting permission denied. chmod is 0777, ownership is root. please adivse?
[02:48] <jamesd> but really microsoft has remote desktop tools pretty well setup, just send a rdesktop invite or have them go to a website and take over .
[02:49] <tgm4883> jamesd: perhaps, although there are other tools for that. I'd much rather that IME didn't exist
[02:49] <Guest95904> so why are thos lkm loaded for it
[02:49] <jamesd> tgm4883: someone asked for it... probablty can be disabled without much trouble
[02:50] <Guest95904> if they dont have a purpose i should have no issues with other things not usesing it with rmmod
[02:50] <tgm4883> jamesd: well that's the rub. It's closed source proprietary stuff. Can it really be disabled?
[02:50] <jamesd> its probably an option in the bios or the ilom.
[02:50] <b-yeezi> samy87 did you look at lsattr? Make sure it is not an immutable file
[02:51] <tgm4883> jamesd: yes, there is an option for that, but I'm not sure I want to trust something so low level on the system that isn't open source
[02:52] <samy87> b-yeezi: no but lsattr says ----i--------e-- i don't know what this means!
[02:53] <lordcirth> samy87, if you are sure you want to delete it, try 'chattr -i <file>'
[02:53] <samy87> never mind i understand
[02:53] <samy87> yes thank you,
[02:53] <b-yeezi> Good
[02:54] <jamesd> tgm4883: may i interest you in a opensource cpu, there are several out there, they aren't cheap but they are opensource.
[02:57] <reisio> they aren't real competitive, either
[02:57] <reisio> but they are open source :)

[04:33] <Xin> someone tried very hard to hack me
[04:33] <Xin> lol
[04:33] <plop_its_ellie> i was also telling a client today about file system snapshots and how it will help against ransomware
[04:33] <plop_its_ellie> i gave her ubuntu 16.06, so realistically the most practical filesystem to put on her external hdd with snapshots would be btrfs
[04:34] <plop_its_ellie> would you guys feel comfortable giving clients btrfs?
[04:34] <Xin> plop_its_ellie; good advice, and yet you yourself go on irc not using a vhost
[04:34] <Xin> xD
[04:34] <somsip> plop_its_ellie: it's more an opinion thing rather than support, so #ubuntu-offtopic or even #linux as a general FS question.
[04:34] <jamesd> plop_its_ellie: well hope another bug comes down from them.. they have had some pretty big showstoppers that destroy data, hope it doesn't destroy your relationship

[05:45] <greydawg> bownsl: that's not enough info mate
[05:45] <bownsl> Well
[05:45] <greydawg> yeah like a SD card?
[05:45] <somsip> bownsl: usually, you need a -dev package to get header files
[05:45] <somsip> bownsl: oh - you did. Ignore that
[05:45] <greydawg> bownsl: yeah
[05:45] <bownsl> as I listed the libsqlite3-dev has the headers
[05:45] <bownsl> i located the headers and it returns /usr/include/sqlite3.h
[05:45] <greydawg> for python it's python-dev
[05:46] <Flippto> greydawg> Yeah. I can partition and format fine. But when the installer runs, it just error out.

[05:48] <Nosophorus> I had an strange problem here with my internet connection.
[05:48] <Flippto> greydawg> When its done copying files over and starting the install. It says the drive is write protected.

[06:32] <Ben64> the + means you have ACLs... what exactly are you trying to accomplish
[06:34] <epifanio__> I'm tring to setup a multi user service, jupyter notebook, which for each user will use the directory  ./local to store some settings related to extension to its interface  that uses the
[06:34] <epifanio__> i did this for one user, now i need to replicate it for other users
[06:35] <epifanio__> so i copied the  ./local from one user ..  inside the home of an other user
[06:35] <tim241> I have a problem when I am trying to build the apk from this tutorial:https://github.com/chenxiaolong/DualBootPatcher/blob/master/docs/BUILD-Android.md : http://pastebin.com/Bgj18urc
[06:35] <epifanio__> and now i got a 500 error
[06:35] <Ben64> ./local isn't very specific
[06:35] <epifanio__> i checked the permisions .. between the 2 directory and they differ for the acl,  ./local/share/nameofthe application
[06:36] <Ben64> how about the owner
[06:37] <epifanio__> exactly this:  http://paste.debian.net/725377/ on top is the original directory on bottom the one i copied
[06:37] <epifanio__> i tried t assign the owner with chown but it didn't change
[06:38] <epifanio__> I have root access, but  i copied it with a normal user
[06:38] <Ben64> stop using "./local" it's impossible to tell the difference
[06:38] <epifanio__> ok, a generic directory
[06:38] <Ben64> ....no give the full path
[06:39] <Ben64> do you see what you pasted? "here is ./local"  .... "and here is ./local"

[06:41] <epifanio__> Ben64, all the files in ./local/share/jupyter/* needs to change from -rwxr-xr-x to -rwxr-xr-x+
[06:41] <Ben64> no
[06:41] <epifanio__> ?
[06:41] <Ben64> the + by itself means nothing
[06:41] <brelod> subuh: i mean are the client and the server on the same LAN network?
[06:41] <subuh> yes, i work localy fror my local server
[06:42] <epifanio__> Ben64, can you explain? I do not undrstand .. that's the main problem
[06:42] <brelod> subuh: is there any firewall settings? everything is accepted?
[06:42] <subuh> my local server ip's 192.168.2.200
[06:42] <tim241> ok
[06:43] <Ben64> epifanio_: it's still not clear to me what you're doing, maybe try explaining it more fully? and use full paths, not relative
[06:43] <subuh> my pc ip's 192.168.2.20
[06:44] <epifanio__> oh, i see. ok. in each $HOME of each user of my server there is a .local folder which has full path:  /home/$USER/.local/share/jupyter/*
[06:44] <subuh> i have tried to ping from my pc to my server, the result is reply
[06:44] <epifanio__> i copied it from one uswer to the other
[06:45] <epifanio__> cp -R /home/$USER_1/.local/share/jupyter/ /home/$USER_2/.local/share/
[06:45] <brelod> subuh: try that: nc -vz 192.168.2.200 22
[06:46] <epifanio__> so now $USER_2 has :  /home/$USER_2/.local/share/jupyter   (as $USER_1)

[06:48] <epifanio__> Ben64 yes
[06:48] <brelod> subuh: if 'connection refused' -> is the service running? 'sudo service ssh status | grep active' -> running or dead in brackets?

[08:33] <Gnomethrower> specifically, if MooseFS or LizardFS or GlusterFS FUSE client crashes, with dir /storage/lfs as the mountpoint, I can't umount /storage/lfs until I kill anything using it. lsof and fuser however are useless in this scenario and do not work with crashed FUSE mountpoints
[08:33] <Gnomethrower> ikonia: in this case I'm talking about actual filesystems. I'm aware FUSE is for other stuff too
[08:33] <ikonia> Gnomethrower: what file system are you actually talking about then
[08:33] <_peter_> @search pease
[08:34] <Gnomethrower> ikonia: LizardFS in this case, but we've seen the same behaviour from Gluster and MooseFS
[08:34] <ikonia> Gnomethrower: isn't this the same situation as any remote userspace mount, as then the mount goes the userdata/status is lost
[08:34] <ikonia> so when you remount tools like lsof won't show anything
[08:35] <hotspot> anybody know how to change channel on the ubuntu hotspot or some other software to create a hotspot without AP mode?
[08:35] <ikonia> so you fix it on the server which the file system is not a userspace mount, it's a local file system
[08:35] <Gnomethrower> ikonia: I'm not worried about remounting losing the status
[08:35] <Gnomethrower> ikonia: I'm wanting to unmount it from a client, but it won't let me while for example nginx is running
[08:36] <Gnomethrower> and usually lsof/fuser would tell you what to kill to be able to successfully umount
[08:36] <Gnomethrower> but lsof and fuser do not work on a crashed FUSE mountpoint
[08:36] <Gnomethrower> okay, apparently this is a kernel limitation and there's really no easy solution
[08:37] <Gnomethrower> so consider my question solved I guess
[08:38] <diverdude> ikonia, if i set up chroot for a specific user logging on via ssh, would that user still be able to run rsync from his home directory to a remote server?
[08:38] <LJHSLDJHSDLJH> how can I copy/paste colored text from terminal into some sort of file format keeping the same coloring?
[08:42] <diverdude> ikonia, hmmm it seems chroot is very insecure and easy to break out from

[08:46] <arlekin> how can i couple hardware touchpad switch with software one in ubuntu 16.04 ?
[08:46] <arlekin> i mean after restart os somehow remembers whether it had disabled touchpad, but hardware switch enables touchpad
[08:47] <arlekin> so now after clicking hardware (and even worse cause software too) touchpad switch
[08:47] <arlekin> it toggles state of touchpad (to enabled in ubuntu) but to disabled on switches
[08:48] <arlekin> in some previous ubuntu version this could be alleviated by changing keyboard shortcut for disabling touchpad

[10:23] <Ben64> Gobo708: can you be more specific
[10:23] <Ben64> mint1234: mint is supported in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[10:24] <Gobo708> Ben64, hi, yes so I have installed ubuntu mate on a raspberry pi microSD
[10:25] <Gobo708> Ben64, I am taking a backup image of the microSD from windows
[10:25] <Gobo708> Ben64, I browsed the MicrosSD, that had ubuntu mate installed on it... and noticed two files of the same size. Approx 3.7G
[10:25] <Gobo708> kernal.img & kernal7.img
[10:26] <Gobo708> Seems to me thats its duplicated the kernal image
[10:26] <ogra_> Gobo708, the two kernel files are a thing from broadcom, you have to ask in the rpi community
[10:26] <ogra_> ubuntu just uses their setup to boot the image
[10:26] <Gobo708> ok thanks
[10:26] <Ben64> well that has nothing to do with ubuntu, if they're 3.7GB it's likely a whole disk image

[11:11] <Snowie> hi all. got thinking about security and decided to look for what open ports there are on my machine. for some reason it looks like wesnoth from the repositories is still running as a daemon, but it's no longer installed on my system. how do i go about hunting it down and killing it, or at least stop the port listening. is it worth being worried?

[11:13] <Fiki> curvian, usually yes
[11:13] <lyze> Snowie, if you are behind a firewall then nah ... normally not
[11:13] <Fiki> curvian, you just need to add the source where a newer package is available, and usually a ppa exists for all popular libraries

[11:44] <ogra_> did you put that file there by hnd ?

[11:44] <marlo_> by root
[11:44] <marlo_> (this has been a problem for a while)
[11:44] <ogra_> well, something put it there ... and it wasnt a deb package
[11:45] <marlo_> on or about that time i went through my regular update procedures
[11:45] <marlo_> and it broke
=== guest-RGxXlo is now known as Thelma
[11:45] <Thelma> Can someone help me
[11:46] <ogra_> marlo_, https://sourceforge.net/p/vdfuse/tickets/1/
[11:46] <Thelma> exit
[11:48] <marlo_> ogra_, thanks, i'm not sure what i'm looking for
[11:49] <ogra_> marlo_, well, you apparently have some third party script or package in use that has put that file into place ... looking at that big above it seems like the hook isnt actually executable ...
[11:49] <ogra_> just read the bug comments
[11:49] <marlo_> ic
[11:49] <marlo_> i'm reading...
[11:49] <marlo_> i see in the comments
[11:50] <marlo_> vdprepare.sh
[11:50] <marlo_> i located that in my /home/mark/Downloads/vdfuse folder!
[11:50] <marlo_> i honestly don't know what that is... but i'm looking to see what i did
[11:51] <marlo_> or the next question would be how do i remove it?
[11:51] <marlo_> it's virtual box!
[11:52] <marlo_> no clue why it's in my home Downloads folder, except that I installed virtual box not from apt but that was some time ago
[11:52] <marlo_> how do i get rid of it?
[11:53] <marlo_> (not virtual box, the error)
[11:53] <ikonia> what is triggering the call to that script
[11:53] <ikonia> I assume it's something within the custom initrd ?
[11:54] <marlo_> well, from what I've observed, updates to the system involve updates to initrd from virtualbox
[11:54] <marlo_> so that's part of it's typical function, beyond me
[11:55] <marlo_> but now something in there is broke with it, i cannot even remove --purge virtual box
[11:56] <marlo_> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/17114572/
[11:56] <ikonia> marlo_: thats not how it should work
[11:57] <ikonia> why would you need something about virtualbox in the pre-boot environment ?
[11:57] <marlo_> ikonia, beats me
[11:57] <marlo_> i've downloaded and installed it for years
[11:57] <ikonia> you won't be "purge" virtualbox as a package if you installed it as a non-package
[11:57] <marlo_> it always seems to hook something in to initrd
=== alberti is now known as sanika
[11:57] <ikonia> so you may need to manually edit the initrd
[11:58] <ogra_> nah
[11:58] <marlo_> well, i download a deb and dpkg on it
[11:58] <marlo_> to install it
=== sanika is now known as alberti
[11:58] <ogra_> mv /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/vdfuse
[11:58] <ogra_> sudo update-initramfs -u
[11:58] <ogra_> done ...
[11:58] <ikonia> ogra_: thats a much nicer way
[11:58] <ogra_> err
[11:58] <ikonia> lovely
[11:58] <ogra_>  mv /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/vdfuse .
[11:58] <akik> marlo_: the package name is probably virtualbox-5.0
[11:59] <marlo_> yup
[11:59] <marlo_> it is
[11:59] <marlo_> !
[11:59] <marlo_> 5.0_5.0.14
[11:59] <akik> i don't think vdfuse is a part of it(?). it was to do with mounting the virtual image files
[12:01] <ogra_> if it would have been ppart of any package "dpkg -S" would have known
[12:01] <ogra_> it definitely isnt
[12:01] <akik> nope
[12:01] <marlo_> ogra_, working now!  thank you, sir!
[12:02] <marlo_> that was driving me mental
[12:02] <ogra_> enjoy :)
[12:02] <marlo_> i'm imaging my virtual box is broken now?
[12:02] <marlo_> but no matter
[12:02] <marlo_> i can sort that one out
[12:02] <alxpa> Fucked my only SD card trying to flash Linux on it from Mac....
[12:02] <marlo_> this was keeping me from upgrading anything
[12:03] <zulfikar354> hi all
[12:03] <akik> marlo_: vdfuse is not part of virtualbox per se
[12:03] <zulfikar354> heei
[12:03] <zulfikar354> are there programmer in here ?
[12:03] <marlo_> akik, it is in my Downloads folder, and has some vb stuff in it
[12:03] <marlo_> so it must have come from that install?
[12:03] <alxpa> It came up with Linux error when I booted off it and now it won't show up on any device...
[12:03] <marlo_> zulfikar354, i am a programmer
[12:04] <zulfikar354> hei nice to meet you marlo
[12:04] <marlo_> ogra_, ooo laa laa... it's nice watching my apt update once again
[12:04] <ogra_> :)
[12:04] <akik> marlo_: no it's not part of virtualbox-5.0
[12:04] <zulfikar354> what kind of programmer
[12:05] <marlo_> zulfikar354, c++

[12:06] <marlo_> brb, i have to see if i can reboot this machine now... something else that broke in all this mess...
[12:07] <alxpa> Is there a way to fix a completely unrecognised SD card??
[12:07] <alxpa> Windows and Mac can't read it.
[12:07] <alxpa> Yet I formatted it in Mac
[12:10] <marlo_> ogra_, yahooo! it reboots as well... i haven't rebooted this computer in months because of this
[12:10] <marlo_> thank you again so much!
[12:10] <ogra_> no problem :)
[12:11] <alxpa> Ogra_ would u know about how to fix an SD card which was screwed up in the process of flashing
[12:11] <marlo_> i have one computer left in this office with windows through no choice of my own, i freaking love linux
[12:12] <jatt> with systemd is there a way to mount all partitions available in /etc/fstab
[12:14] <ogra_> alxpa, not really, no ... sorry
[12:14] <alxpa> No problem ogra_
[12:14] <ikonia> jatt: that happens automatically at boot
[12:15] <ikonia> it's the equivilent of the old "mountall" init script

[12:42] <ikonia> R13ose: it means there are updates available to you
[12:42] <ikonia> it would be wise to apply the
[12:42] <ikonia> them
[12:44] <R13ose> ikonia: yes but which updates?
[12:44] <BluesKaj> it's exactly what it says important updates for your Operating System (os) , R13ose...the package manager doesn't lie :-)
[12:44] <Pici> I'm pretty sure the gui will tell you which ones once you click through that (although I don't use Ubuntu Desktop, so ymmv)

[12:53] <doublel93> 5901, I've installed vncserver and then vnc4server I feel so confused, vnc4server is telling me "connection refused by the host computer", any idea ?

[12:58] <sxpert> have a small issue I can't find a solution in google for:
[12:58] <sxpert> I have this python app, and intend to use uwsgi to run it.
[12:58] <R13ose> ikonia: Yes but I want to get rid of the packages and I thought there was a command for that.
[12:58] <sxpert> it seems there's a probleme with the system provided stuff
[12:58] <sxpert> as I'm getting some errors :
[12:59] <k1l> mircx1: cant tell you from that single output. ask the ones who gave you the code to compile what depencies that code got
[12:59] <sxpert> Job for uwsgi.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See "systemctl status uwsgi.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.\
[12:59] <bory1time> I installed ubuntu on a dell d6000 but it wont connect via wifi how do i fix
[12:59] <sxpert> do I have to modify the .service thing ?
[13:02] <doublel93> still with vnc4server ,  if I start it with "vncserver"  I can connect to it, but if I start with "vncserver -geometry 1280x720 -randr 1280x720" on the client sais connection refused by the host, why is that ?

[13:05] <DJones> bdonnahue: Its difficult to say, it works for me, does everything I want with no bugs, but every user is different, maybe the best course of action isto create a live usb and try it to see if makes much difference

[13:27] <jimbotux> hello! Wondering if anyone could advise on something im trying to figure out with ulimits and differences between 1604 & 1404 LTS versions
[13:28] <jimbotux> when making changes to /etc/security/limits.conf in 1604 it doesnt seem i need to add anything like "session required         pam_limits.so"
[13:28] <jimbotux> to my common sessions for it to pickup the ulimit changes
[13:28] <jimbotux> but with 1404 without those changes the user in question wont get the limits edit...
[13:29] <morrolan1> l
[13:29] <jimbotux> does anyone know if this is maybe something to do with systemd and logind..? i can see pam_systemd mentioned now in common-sessions as standard in 1604.
[13:29] <jimbotux> Any help or advice would be great cheers.

[13:33] <sveinse> I'm trying to get crashplan running on a NAS server running 16.04, and I keep getting not-found by stsremctl status crashplan, despite that a service has been installed to /etc/init.d. I thought systemctl evaluated legacy init.d services as well. What can I do to proceed the debugging?
[13:33] <ikonia> sveinse: no it won't
[13:33] <jimbotux> ikonia, so i make the change then sudo su - USERNAME and changes are there in 1604
[13:33] <ikonia> sveinse: list the unit files
[13:33] <ikonia> jimbotux: ahh, that isn't a surprise
[13:33] <ikonia> as that is a session parameter
[13:33] <jimbotux> ikonia, but 1404 nothing until i add the common sessions.
[13:34] <sveinse> ikonia: ? list unit files?
[13:34] <ikonia> sveinse: yes the systemd
[13:34] <ikonia> sveinse: as /etc/init.d means nothing
[13:34] <ikonia> sveinse: I assume this is not coming from the ubuntu repo
[13:34] <ikonia> rather some 3rd party repo
[13:34] <Xin> evening all
[13:34] <ikonia> jimbotux: that sort of makes sense
[13:35] <sveinse> ikonia: But why does ubuntu maintain /etc/rc*.d/ then? That is lecacy init.d isn't it?
[13:35] <ikonia> sveinse: yes, as some upstart scripts are wrapped
[13:35] <jimbotux> ikonia, Could you explain why please? Im scratching my head..am i missing something or has something changed. Thanks
