[02:24] <hannasanarion> I've tried typing in my password, and then using the magic sysrq, and nothing happened
[02:25] <pnunn> I'd still take out the graphics card if you suspect it, could be pulling down the bus.
[02:25] <pnunn> Do the keyboard indicators work?
[02:26] <hannasanarion> pnunn, no they don't
[02:26] <TuxThePenguin> pnunn, what did you want her to do with the video card again?
[02:26] <zelot> hi, where can i get some help in regards to issues with mount?
[02:26] <TuxThePenguin> After taking it out
[02:26] <hannasanarion> TuxThePenguin, try booting with monitors connected to motherboard, I think
[02:26] <pnunn> TuxThePonguin, sounds like there is on board graphics as well, so try that without the card, but sounds pretty low level.
[02:26] <pnunn> Yeh, just one monitor though, keep it simple.
[02:27] <hannasanarion> pnunn, right
[02:27] <TuxThePenguin> Makes sense to me :)
[02:27] <pnunn> process of elimination.
[02:27] <TuxThePenguin> Along with Occam's Razor
[02:27] <Bashing-om> zelot: If you are on a supported release of 'buntu, this is a good place to ask.
[02:27] <TuxThePenguin> Any solution is most likely the simplest one
[02:28] <wllrt> I'm a emacs newb and looking to prevent rsi. I'm using a thinkpad keyboard. Any emacs users here please recommend a good keybinding strategy? Thanks.
[02:29] <zelot> I am having difficulties mounting an external network drive on ubuntu. It was working fine a couple of days ago and now its not working. I can access the file via smbclient just fine
[02:30] <zelot> this is the file from fstab: 10.2.0.77:wmware /media/beefcake nfs rw,hard,intr 0 0
[02:30] <hannasanarion> pnunn, TuxThePenguin, alright, so pulling the graphics card did not help
[02:30] <TuxThePenguin> So, it could be the motherboard or the monitor
[02:31] <ObrienDave> sounds like we just witnessed a MB going south
[02:31] <TuxThePenguin> What is MB?
[02:31] <ObrienDave> Mother Board
[02:31] <pnunn> How many monitors do you have there? Just to be sure, try all the video connectors, but it doesn't sound good.
[02:31] <robjloranger> quick question about print settings. i have everything set in printer options through admin panels, and also through cups web interface. but each time i go to print the default settings do not match what i have set. even though on checking them they are still set correctly system wide. just not in individual programs, ie. browsers, ocular etc
[02:31] <TuxThePenguin> Then yes, I agree
[02:32] <pnunn> The other thing you can try is just wiggle (technical term) all of the connectors, including the power one, just to be sure there all seated. properly.
[02:32] <TuxThePenguin> hannasanarion, did you restart your computer? Get a BSOD?
[02:32] <hannasanarion> alright, i'll wiggle all the connectors, and then try my vga monitor
[02:32] <TuxThePenguin> Before the problem I mean
[02:33] <robjloranger> is there a second location these preferences are kept? a file somewhere that is for whatever reason not being overwritten
[02:33] <zelot> anyone? :/
[02:33] <hannasanarion> TuxThePenguin, no, It had just been crashing every once in a while (mostly when running several youtube videos at once, or viewing an imgur album), so I turned it off to check the hard drive
[02:33] <ObrienDave> try different monitors, different video ports, check ALL connections, etc...
[02:33] <hannasanarion> I'm t wiggling all the connections, and plugging in the other monitor now
[02:33] <TuxThePenguin> Okay, well I think the crashing is a RAM issue
[02:34] <Bashing-om> zelot: While awaiting the network gurus, does the mount point "/media/beefcake" still exist, and can yoy ping 10.2.0.77 ??
[02:34] <zelot> yes to both
[02:35] <pnunn> Good thought TuxThePenguin pop the ram out and re-seat it too hannasanarion.
[02:35] <TuxThePenguin> The crashing-while-watching-YouTube thing usually means RAM, and since you seem to possibly be having a video problem...maybe they are linked?
[02:36] <robjloranger> sorry i missed everything cause i just joined, is it not booting?
[02:36] <TuxThePenguin> No, she doesnt get video
[02:36] <TuxThePenguin> And it seems peripherals are failing too
[02:37] <robjloranger> so how are we sure it isn't booting? with no video.
[02:37] <TuxThePenguin> Yeah, you're right...sorry XD
[02:37] <Bashing-om> Zethrok: Sorry, I do not know else.. others will have to advise.
[02:37] <robjloranger> more so, how are we sure it is not that the machine will not boot
[02:37] <ObrienDave> no beeps, no keyboard lights
[02:38] <robjloranger> ya that's not booting
[02:38] <TuxThePenguin> Also, she mentioned it crashing after having too many youtube videos open. That's a RAM issue most likely... I dont know if that can be linked or not
[02:38] <hannasanarion> hey, I've never done RAM before, any tricks on getting it back in?
[02:38] <robjloranger> the ram is a good place to start. try removing all sticks of ram and booting, if it works: add one at a time until you find the dead one.
[02:39] <pnunn> Just make sure it's the right way around (will only go one way) then just push hard, it takes a bit of force to get the latches back down.
[02:39] <ObrienDave> yes, you GENTLY hold the side tabs open
[02:39] <pnunn> One end at a time.
[02:39] <robjloranger> hannasanarion, yes. some are inserted at an angle, then rocked into the straight position.. one sec
[02:39] <ObrienDave> latches, side tabs, same diff
[02:39] <hannasanarion> robjloranger: it won't boot without the ram in
[02:40] <pnunn> No, but it should beep like crazy.
[02:40] <hannasanarion> no beeping
[02:40] <robjloranger> hannasanarion, did you get any beeps?
[02:40] <benwright> With Windows 8.1 dual booting with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the partition manager in the installer doesn't recognised the free space not allocated to the NTFS partition.
[02:40] <pnunn> Doesn't sound good.
[02:40] <TuxThePenguin> Could the BIOS be failing?
[02:40] <pnunn> Don't suppose you have a multi meter handy.
[02:40] <benwright> Wondering what the issues is with this, someone said this could be to do with Windows new dynamic disks, however the disk type on the free space partition is basic.
[02:40] <hannasanarion> no I don't, and I'm jobless atm, so I would really rather not go get one
[02:40] <TuxThePenguin> By failing, I mean could it not be loading
[02:41]  * ObrienDave votes for MB fail or CMOS battery died
[02:41] <robjloranger> sounds like some sort of motherboard issue, weather bios or full blown dead mother board it's hard to say
[02:41] <pnunn> OK, could just eliminate the power supply with one. Doesn't sound too promising though.
[02:41] <TuxThePenguin> It might be BIOS i think...but power supply is a good idea too
[02:41] <ObrienDave> ^^
[02:41] <benwright> Any ideas?
[02:41] <hannasanarion> if it's a power problem, would the fan and hard drive be spinning?
[02:41] <robjloranger> hannasanarion, are you getting any fans or anything? no light on the case?
[02:42] <hannasanarion> all the lights are working properly
[02:42] <hannasanarion> fans and hard drives are spinning
[02:42] <pnunn> Yeh hanna, they can, could have 12V but not 5V. Seen that before.
[02:42] <TuxThePenguin> Then its BIOS i think
[02:42] <robjloranger> ok so PS (powersupply) sounds fine
[02:43] <robjloranger> is it very old?
[02:43] <benwright> What is hannasanarion issue? I might have had something similar before.
[02:43] <pnunn> Not so fast on that one robjloranger, seen one rail of a supply go down and keep things like fans happy. Could be as simple as no power good line.
[02:43] <hannasanarion> No, got it winter 2010
[02:43] <TuxThePenguin> benwright, she cant boot up it seems
[02:43] <ObrienDave> no beeps, no keyboard lights
[02:43] <benwright> Alright, where does it fail in the boot process?
[02:43] <benwright> So you see the BIOS screen?
[02:43] <robjloranger> from the get go
[02:43] <pnunn> There is no boot process.
[02:43] <hannasanarion> I don't know. No display, no bios
[02:43] <ObrienDave> no video either
[02:43] <TuxThePenguin> She sees nothing at all
[02:43] <benwright> Yeah, hardware failure.
[02:43] <TuxThePenguin> Well, maybe
[02:43] <TuxThePenguin> It could be BIOS
[02:43] <robjloranger> we made it that far :)
[02:44] <hannasanarion> it's not the gpu, and it's not the RAM
[02:44] <benwright> If you don't see the bios screen at all, you motherboard may be fried.
[02:44] <pnunn> Pretty unlikely Tux, if no sign of life at all. More likely MB
[02:44] <benwright> What is your motherboard model?
[02:44] <robjloranger> that's where i'm headed
[02:44] <TuxThePenguin> Okay, good point
[02:44] <benwright> I have had the same thing before.
[02:44] <hannasanarion> how could that have happened though? it was working fine before I opened it
[02:44] <robjloranger> me too
[02:44] <benwright> Luckily motherboards are not too expensive.
[02:44] <TuxThePenguin> Been a while since I've had a hardware failure of this magnitude
[02:45] <robjloranger> you opened it? what did you do once inside?
[02:45] <hannasanarion> it's a HP p6610f, all stock except graphics
[02:45] <benwright> hannasanarion Lots of reasons, possibly a fault in the product. How old is the motherboard?
[02:45] <hannasanarion> I wiggled the hard drive to see if it was loose, (it's not), then i blew out some dust
[02:45] <TuxThePenguin> Since it's stock, how old is the machine itself
[02:45] <hannasanarion> 2010
[02:45] <robjloranger> 6706f here :) canada?
[02:45] <hannasanarion> no, Arizona
[02:45] <TuxThePenguin> Got a warranty to cover it?
[02:45] <benwright> Generally a motherboard will have a set of LEDs on it
[02:46] <benwright> That flash to indicate error codes.
[02:46] <robjloranger> :( i thought the f was for french/english like here in canada.. anyway, sorry off topic
[02:46] <hannasanarion> here's the mb
[02:46] <benwright> You can always start the boot, look at the leds and decode them to the respective error.
[02:46] <hannasanarion> Manufacturer: FoxconnMotherboard Name: H-ALVORIX_HF-RS880-uATXHP/Compaq motherboard name: Alvorix-GL8E
[02:46] <dino82> Not sure if this is ubuntu/debian centric or what, but why is it that when I run php code in the CLI (php file.php) I get a ton of SNMP OID messages?  There's no snmp code in the php
[02:46] <TuxThePenguin> Foxconn, isnt that the Japanese manufacturer for apple? (off-topic I know)
[02:46] <benwright> What I did when this happened was I got the motherboard manual, and I looked at the led error codes and then found out my motherboard was fucked :P
[02:46] <somsip> dino82: paste examples using paste.ubuntu.com
[02:47] <somsip> !language | benwright
[02:47] <ubottu> benwright: The main Ubuntu channels require that you speak in calm, polite English. For other languages, please visit https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/ChannelList
[02:47] <robjloranger> lol
[02:47] <benwright> Sorry I was on #ubuntu before !language existed :/
[02:47] <hannasanarion> foxxconn is chinese I think
[02:47] <benwright> in 2007
[02:47] <somsip> benwright: then you know to avoid swearing...
[02:47] <TuxThePenguin> well, anyways could your hard drive's data be affected from a MB failure
[02:48] <hannasanarion> well, i assume not, and I have the important stuff backed up
[02:48] <benwright> somsip Yep, best ban words not the context they are used in.
[02:48] <TuxThePenguin> Okay, that's good at least.
[02:48] <benwright> somsip You can have horrific opinions that don't use "curse" words.
[02:48] <dino82> somsip: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7661497/
[02:48] <benwright> Yep, so if you aren't seeing the BIOS screen the HD isn't the issue.
[02:48] <benwright> At least it is failing before that point.
[02:49] <hannasanarion> yeah, thre's 5 leds, labelled cr1-5, and cr5 is lit green
[02:49] <TuxThePenguin> Green is usually a positive color
[02:49] <benwright> Alright, so in the motherboard manual that probably means something, green usually indicates good.
[02:49] <ObrienDave> only if it's a dual color led
[02:49] <benwright> Do you hear the disk spinning?
[02:49] <robjloranger> yes
[02:50] <TuxThePenguin> So, hypothetically if the motherboard isnt failing or dead, what could it be?
[02:50] <benwright> So alternatively you may not be seeing the BIOS screen because you aren't rendering the framebuffer to a monitor...
[02:50] <benwright> And it is booting.
[02:50] <hannasanarion> I heard the disk spinning when it first booted,but not afterwards
[02:50] <somsip> dino82: try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21257589/ubuntu-typing-php-in-terminal-shows-a-lot-of-errors
[02:50] <benwright> Oh, hmm
[02:50] <benwright> Still sounds like a motherboard failure.
[02:50] <robjloranger> when you try to cold boot, from fully off, does one of the led's blink in a pattern?
[02:51] <benwright> What component on the board did you change when it started failing
[02:51] <TuxThePenguin> Could it be a virus? I agree with MB failure but is a virus a possibility?
[02:51] <benwright> Or did it randomly fail this morning?
[02:51] <dino82> thanks, I'll try it again
[02:51] <hannasanarion> no
[02:51] <dino82> worked, thanks
[02:51] <pnunn> TuxThePenguin little or no chance its a virus.
[02:51] <benwright> A virus would want your PC to boot so it could steal your credit card info.
[02:51] <somsip> dino82: np
[02:52] <benwright> And no, wouldn't be that.
[02:52] <hannasanarion> robjloranger: the light is always on, nothing changes when I boot
[02:52] <benwright> Either your GPU or motherboard has failed.
[02:52] <benwright> Sounds like the motherboard.
[02:52] <benwright> If you have another board you can test the GPU in isolation
[02:52] <robjloranger> so there is no error code via led
[02:52] <TuxThePenguin> DO you have a spare?
[02:52] <pnunn> or psu
[02:52] <hannasanarion> benwright: the failure didn't randomly happen, it happened after I took it apart to do a little cleaning
[02:52] <benwright> :/ Static damage?
[02:52] <TuxThePenguin> Oh you could have shorted out the board
[02:52] <hannasanarion> I took the gpu out to see if the computer would boot without it, and no dice
[02:52] <mxvxrts> benwright, robjloranger, use nicks to preface answers to others here please
[02:53] <robjloranger> mxcxrts, sure no problem
[02:53] <hannasanarion> if it's static damage or a short, can it be fixed, or am I out of luck
[02:53] <benwright> I actually had a question of my own, but I thought I would earn some credit before asking it :P I don't know if I have been that much help.
[02:53] <mxvxrts> cool thanks
[02:53] <TuxThePenguin> hannasanarion when you say take apart can you expand on the extent of what you did
[02:53] <benwright> hannasanarion Integrated circuits make that almost impossible.
[02:53] <somsip> benwright: go for it. The hardware support issue is well off topic anyway
[02:54] <robjloranger> benwright, what's your question?
[02:54] <TuxThePenguin> We can take this over to the offtopic channel
[02:54] <TuxThePenguin> If that helps somsip
[02:54] <somsip> TuxThePenguin: that would be helpful, thanks
[02:54] <benwright> Well I noticed in Windows 8.1 that when making a free partition space this isn't detected by Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
[02:54] <TuxThePenguin> Well, I'll be over there.
[02:54] <hannasanarion> Okay, what's the name of the offtopic channel?
[02:54] <benwright> Which is a bit annoying, I am guessing this is windows not being compatible from my understanding of how gparted works I don't see how it couldn't be detected.

[02:55] <benwright> UEFI could be an issue, except this PC had funtoo linux on it for 2 years :/
[02:55] <TuxThePenguin> Oh well then D
[02:55] <TuxThePenguin> XD
[02:55] <litropy> I'm on 13.10. Is there any way to make it so that when I have multiple windows of an application open, and I click the icon to show all the windows, it DOESN'T do the zoom out animation?
[02:55] <benwright> But not sure how UEFI interacts with partitions... I will check this out.
[02:55] <mxvxrts> benwright, more basic info might be helpful. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2147295
[02:56] <robjloranger> oh geeze, UEFI is a bit beyond me benwright. but the whole partition mapping is different as far as i know. ubuntu can be compatible, it's just a bit more work.. i have a link somewhere
[02:57] <robjloranger> benwright, check here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/UEFI-and-BIOS
[02:57] <benwright> Oh yeah this makes sense, windows messed with boot support on the GPT table -_-
[02:57] <robjloranger> benwright, it's not the computers UEFI functionality, but win 8 creating a UEFI partition map/table whichever it's called
[02:58] <benwright> Yep, this isn't supported by ubuntu which is why it cannot see the disk.
[02:58] <benwright> the partition***
[02:58] <benwright> This is going to make it uber painful to install.
[02:58] <robjloranger> benwright, if you prefer the old way, you can apparently get win 8 to install without UEFI, i think it's in that link i put up
[02:59] <mxvxrts> benwright, This is an OEM correct?
[03:00] <robjloranger> benwright, sorry not that one. but in this link there is info on getting win 8 to disable uefi  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[03:00] <mxvxrts> manufacturers install of W8=OEM  benwright
[03:00] <benwright> I might just install ubuntu in efi mode
[03:00] <benwright> I reinstalled windows on my PC after using linux for 12 years, for the first time the other week.
[03:01] <benwright> But going to work out this bloody UEFI nonsense.

[03:35] <lotuspsychje> BlackWeb: you also sure you installed correct graphics driver? youtube play hd 1080p?
[03:36] <BlackWeb> Yea, Which right now I'm using 14.04 - 32Bit   - Which seems to be running alot better then the 64Bit
[03:36] <holstein> BlackWeb: 64bit 14.04?
[03:36] <lotuspsychje> BlackWeb: i use 64bit fine
[03:37] <holstein> i use 64 or 32.. they both run fine
[03:37] <robjloranger> hi, i hate printing. ok really i just want to know where else, other than system/admin settings panels, printer default settings are stored... they are being cheeky
[03:37] <BlackWeb> Yeah right now currently using 32Bit of 14.04   - I first installed the 64bit one and it seemed alot worse
[03:37] <Neo31> Hello folks, anyone familiar with web2py+apache installation please ?
[03:37] <holstein> BlackWeb: if you had 64bit 13.10 and you are comparing it to 32bit 14.04, there can be more going on there..
[03:38] <lotuspsychje> !lamp | Neo31
[03:38] <ubottu> Neo31: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process.
[03:38] <lotuspsychje> kidpool: maybe the ##hardware guys might also know?
[03:38] <BlackWeb> No I tried 64Bit 14.04 ,   Havent tried 13.10   - Upgraded from 12.04  32Bit,  Did fresh install of 14.04 64Bit first
[03:39] <lotuspsychje> robjloranger: what printer brand do you have?
[03:39] <Neo31> lotuspsychje, I know how to setup lamp, but I am having issues with apache configuration to work with web2py
[03:40] <holstein> BlackWeb: so, its not a fresh install then?
[03:40] <lotuspsychje> Neo31: maybe the #httpd guys might know it?
[03:40] <BlackWeb> It is a fresh install
[03:40] <Deihmos> why would you need ro disable uefi

[03:41] <holstein> BlackWeb: since you have added codec support
[03:41] <BlackWeb> yea
[03:42] <lotuspsychje> Deihmos: what is your specific issue then?
[03:42] <Deihmos> I have no issue. I guess I was looking at an old message
[03:43] <lotuspsychje> robjloranger: try apt-cache search epson, i think there are some tools for epson around
[03:43] <mxvxrts> robjloranger, On occasion with printer problems I just remove the driver and reinstall in the printer app, mine has no specific configs.
[03:44] <robjloranger> the thing is that the printer works fine, i can manually set the print options when printing via the dialog but nothing will use the defaults i have set
[03:46] <holstein> robjloranger: what settings? you mean, quality settings? are you sure the settings are not changing?
[03:47] <robjloranger> holstein, i mean the paper size and source settings, also quality too

[06:34] <larrypg> babinlonston, if you do not have anything important I would install windows first and leave enough space for ubuntu and then install ubuntu
[06:35] <mxvxrts> babinlonston, Probably a clone would work, but you have to have room for it to be in a primary partition not a logical inside an extended, or at least the windows boot partition in a primary.
[06:35] <babinlonston> larrypg: already installed and a Developer working in it, so is it possible to fix the issue pls guide
[06:36] <babinlonston> mxvxrts: got it, then every windows installation must be in Primary right for dual boot
[06:37] <mxvxrts> babinlonston, basically yes, however if you have the windows boot partition in a primary the OS can be in an extended, I'm not sure I have seen anyone with that set up though, but it will work.

[06:55] <arog> that's crazy!
[06:55] <mxvxrts> arog, THat is to full anyway
[06:55] <Ben64> arog: it probably is reserved space
[06:55] <arog> what do you mean
[06:55] <mxvxrts> arog, It is not crazy it is the way it is look it up.
[06:56] <arog> got a link?
[06:56] <arog> im not sure what to search for
[06:57] <mxvxrts> arog, The difference is 1000MB for a gig and 1024 for a gig if I have the numbers correct.
[06:57] <Ben64> arog: by default 5% of a filesystem is reserved for root, 5% of 909G is 45.45G, 45.45+15+848=908.45
[06:57] <Ben64> mxvxrts: thats not the issue here
[06:58] <mxvxrts> Ben64, May not be, however this is true.
[06:58] <Ben64> right, but irrelevant to the current topic
[06:58] <mxvxrts> Ben64, You have not confirmed that well enough to talk that way to me to be honest or at any time. ;)
[06:58] <arog> oh i see Ben64
[06:59] <fralle__> somebody knows what to do when autotools configure hangs on "checking for tputs in -lncurses"? (ubuntu 13.10)
[06:59] <arog> 5% for root wow wonder why it's using that much
[06:59] <Ben64> mxvxrts: to talk what way? you're giving information that isn't relevant to the issue
[06:59] <Ben64> arog: it isn't being used, it's just reserved for root. you can change the percentage if you wish
[06:59] <arog> I was going to guess 3gb (thats what google says ubuntu installation is) + maybe 1.5x RAM (I only have 4GB) so total is ~9gb
[07:00] <arog> Ben64: do you know why the reserve is set so high? Is there a performance hit if I lower it?
[07:01] <larrypg> arog, probably so that if you do hit the limit the system still has enough in reserve to fix things (get rid of things)
[07:03] <dunbuggy> hey yall im a bit confused
[07:03] <dunbuggy> ive been using a python program from the comman line, and when i call it from php, i cant get the results the same way
[07:03] <dunbuggy> i tried changing the locale charset but it didnt seem to work
[07:04] <dunbuggy> the encoding is effed up
[07:04] <dunbuggy> any troublshooting ideas would be rad
[07:05] <arog> okay ill leave it then, thank you

[07:35] <FreewheelinFrank> how can i install flash player for firefox?

[07:37] <leeyaa> srsly -.-
[07:38] <mxvxrts> FreewheelinFrank, flashplugin-installer
[07:38] <FreewheelinFrank> <mxvxrts>which version
[07:39] <mxvxrts> FreewheelinFrank, I believe there is only one that is the name of it.
[07:39] <FreewheelinFrank> <mxvxrts>there is a YUM, RPM and tar.gz
[07:40] <mxvxrts> FreewheelinFrank, Linux does not have the latest flash, if that is the refrence
[07:40] <tomengland> there is no .deb?
[07:40] <helmut_> hi
[07:40] <mxvxrts> FreewheelinFrank, Not from adobe, but from the ubuntu repos
[07:40] <FreewheelinFrank> <mxvxrts>there are a few options downloading from the adobe site. It used to work but then I upgraded to ubuntu version 14
[07:41] <FreewheelinFrank> <mxvxrts>well I did install from that but it still does not work. am sure there were instructions to install manually and some settings to change
[07:42] <mxvxrts> FreewheelinFrank, We only support what comes from the ubuntu repos, there is nothing at adobe fir linux that is above what you get in the repos.
[07:43] <mxvxrts> adobe does not really support linux flash anymore, have not far awhile
[07:43] <FreewheelinFrank> <mxvxrts>By repos i assume you mean the ubuntu software centre. it says use lightspark as an alternative so I will ry that
[07:45] <mxvxrts> FreewheelinFrank, your choice but all you have to do is open a terminal and run sudp apt-get install flashplugin-installer

[08:34] <Jeroen_Mathon> Hmm
[08:34] <Jeroen_Mathon> kaitanya when did this problem occour?
[08:35] <kaitanya> jeroen_mathon: today, my first logins
[08:37] <Jeroen_Mathon> kaitanya Did you change your locales?
[08:37] <kaitanya> jeroen_mathon: yeah, from en_GB to fi_FI, LC_ALL was set to C
[08:38] <Jeroen_Mathon> kaitanya Do you run a server or a desktop version of Ubuntu>
[08:39] <kaitanya> jeroen_mathon: server, and export LC_ALL=en_GB.UTF-8 works but LC_ALL=fi_FI.UTF-8 doesnt
[08:39] <Jeroen_Mathon> kaitanya Let me do some quick research
[08:40] <Jeroen_Mathon> kaitanya can you paste the output of locale -a in ubuntu pastebin
[08:40] <kaitanya> jeroen_mathon: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7662636/
[08:41] <kaitanya> darn
[08:42] <tapasweni_pathak> Trying for the first time.
[08:42] <Jeroen_Mathon> kaitanya and the output of locale
[08:44] <kaitanya> jeroen_mathon: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7662641/
[08:44] <Jeroen_Mathon> kaitanya did you try modifying this file?  /etc/default/locale
[08:44] <kaitanya> jeroen_mathon: wait
[08:45] <kaitanya> jeroen_mathon: i set it to fi_FI
[08:45] <Jeroen_Mathon> kaitanya Ok try now does it work?
[08:46] <Jeroen_Mathon> kaitanya If taht didn't work take a look here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Locale
[08:47] <kaitanya> jeroen_mathon: now its en_GB and everything is working but cant just change LC_ALL to anything... going to the park with kids now so gonna check this later

[08:52] <mregg> Hi - in a bash script, how can I create a folder, the name of which is to be based on a file's date?
=== billstclair is now known as Guest77281
[09:01] <Scratchy> Morning everybody !
[09:03] <jayesh> good afternoon
[09:03] <MayurYa> afternoon mi8y :D
[09:05] <Jeroen_Mathon> mregg You want to create a Bash script that makes a folder with the files date?
[09:06] <mregg> Jeroen_Mathon: I want to copy my files into different folders which I would name based on dates. Eg : a file created on 2014-01-23 goes to folder 2014-01, a file created on 2014-03-12 goes to 2014-03, etc.
[09:07] <Jeroen_Mathon> mregg Did you do some research before you started Writing the bash code?
[09:07] <mregg> Jeroen_Mathon: so far I'm trying to experiment with ls -l | awk '{print $5} but I'm not successful
[09:09] <Jeroen_Mathon> mregg What i thing is that you need these methods: catagorize array(File names) by date,Create folder for Catagories,Put corosponding subitems in their catagorized folders
[09:09] <Jeroen_Mathon> Those are the methods or functions your program would need.
[09:10] <Jeroen_Mathon> Youl need to store these variables Array(Catagories),Array(Filenames),string(Date)
[09:10] <Jeroen_Mathon> You could replace the string with an array. for convinience
[09:10] <lkthomas> guys, how could I execute a program to console when ubuntu first time boot up?
[09:11] <Jeroen_Mathon> lkthomas put them in /etc/init.d
[09:12] <lkthomas> Jeroen_Mathon: I also want to hold up all starting program
[09:12] <InFierno> put in a delay then...
[09:12] <InFlames> anyone having problems with 14.04? cuz man, i have never had such a rough time with ubuntu
[09:13] <dwatkins> what problems in particular are you seeing, InFlames?
[09:13] <Jeroen_Mathon> InFlames I only had trouble with the ubuntu 13
[09:13] <robbr> so i just install ubuntu-desktop metapackage with the --without-recommends flag... and now unity is pretty much broken. wtf?
[09:13] <mregg> Jeroen_Mathon: if I do a : "for file in *;  do", how do I get $file's timestamp?
[09:13] <robbr> for example, no installed applications show up under "applications"
[09:13] <robbr> installed*
[09:14] <stevenm> Hey if I haven't chosen automatic login on install - how do I turn that on later?
[09:14] <dwatkins> mregg: have a look at the "find" command, you can do stuff based on the timestamp with it
[09:14] <jblake> hi
[09:14] <ahigginbottom> wazzzupp niggy
[09:14] <jblake> oh ma gawd
[09:14] <InFlames> dwatkins, i was running the upgrades after it completely the distribution upgrade and now when i try to upgrade it says something is wrong, then says it can only do a partial upgrade, then i try the partial and it logs me out and kills my whole session
[09:15] <stevenm> nvm found it
[09:15] <cshaw> lol
[09:15] <Jeroen_Mathon> Try cntrl+alt+F1 Login as root and then try
[09:15] <mregg> dwatkins: find will tell me files that are older than x number of days, what I'm looking for is for each file, what is their timestamp
[09:15] <ahigginbottom> lolololololololloollololololl

[09:20] <mikodo> When mtab opens partitions in an external Hard-drive, is it normal for the permissions for the partitions to be owned by root?
[09:20] <Jeroen_Mathon> Youl need to run partitioning software as root
[09:21] <Jeroen_Mathon> So yes it is normal mikodo :)
[09:21] <Jeroen_Mathon> At least i hope
[09:21] <dwatkins> mikodo: what format is the partition?
[09:21] <robbr> clear
[09:21] <mikodo> dwa
[09:22] <dwatkins> mikodo: I mean is it FAT32, ext3 etc.?
[09:22] <mikodo> dwatkins, EXT 4
[09:22] <dwatkins> mikodo: in that case, the mounted partition should have ownership as defined within the partition; you may have to re-chown directories if it's taken from a different system, as the user IDs might not match
[09:23] <dwatkins> but if the files were owned by root originally, that should still be the case now
[09:24] <mikodo> dwatkins, So, will it be ok to change them to be owned by my user, to not have to use root to use Back in Time?
[09:25] <Jeroen_Mathon> Backintime uses rsync
[09:25] <Jeroen_Mathon> It coppies permissions
[09:25] <dwatkins> I'd suggest running any backup script as root anyway.

[10:07] <MayurYa> ^ check keyboard layout.. if password contains special chars.. that might* be the reason.
[10:07] <n1n0> it's not that
[10:07] <n1n0> or also read that it can be reinstalled in a way that all the apps, docs and bookmarks to remain
[10:08] <n1n0> can it?
[10:09] <MayurYa> how about resetting root or user's password, tried?

[10:11] <n1n0> not even that

[10:14] <n1n0> cfhowlett can I somehow fetch the bookmarks prior to that?
[10:14] <xubuntu438> cfhowlett, my question is: why? no method is going to be faster than direct download

[10:15] <cfhowlett> *boookmarks*

[10:15] <n1n0> cfhowlett didn't back it up and now cannot access into the sys. can i somehow do it from tty?

[10:48] <p3rror> hello
[10:49] <cfhowlett> p3rror greetings.  ask ubuntu questions
[10:49] <p3rror> How can I denied access to mysql cli command for a user
[10:49] <p3rror> I think that there are not many solutions
[10:49] <p3rror> we can chroot that user
[10:50] <skrrp> don't give them the passwords for the database root user or any databases?
[10:51] <p3rror> Or use selinux or maybe apparmor
[10:52] <p3rror> skrrp I say it to my boss
[10:52] <p3rror> he does not accept
[10:52] <p3rror> he need only to denied mysql cli for user aptus
[10:52] <p3rror> so I thought to chroot aptus
[10:52] <p3rror> using selinux is very complicated
[10:53] <skrrp> can you not chmod u-x the executable and then add people you want to run it to a group?
[10:53] <skrrp> sorry
[10:53] <skrrp> a-x
[10:56] <p3rror> skrrp please explain
[10:58] <skrrp> chmod is the command to change file permissions. permissions are read, write, execute (rwx) for user, group, all (uga). if you chmod a-x (all minus execute) then only the owner of the file and groups (ug) will be able to run the file
[10:58] <p3rror> but in general
[10:58] <p3rror> the owner of `which mysql`
[10:59] <p3rror> is root ?
[10:59] <p3rror> msyql ?
[10:59] <p3rror> what the deal wth group
[10:59] <skrrp> i don't know. if you ls -l the file it will tell you user and group owners

[11:24] <skrrp> apologies in advance for the wall-o'text. i've got an insidious problem on my hands - my sales team and i (techie) are all running 14.04 with KDE, Thunderbird and Firefox. main application is SugarCRM (web-based). i don't have this problem but my sales team do - every now and again their keyboard stops working. they can't type into emails or Firefox. the only difference is that sales are...
[11:24] <skrrp> ...running the Opacus plugin for Thunderbird and also have JavaScript alert(); s popping up from Sugar for call reminders. a workaround is for them is to click the K menu and type something into the search box, then the keyboard starts to work  again for Thunderbird and Firefox. anyone have any ideas as to a cause or a cure?

=== WLM|zzzzz is now known as WLM
[11:53] <sydney> Or should i wait for 14.04.1?
[11:53] <histo> ronin: I don't believe sendmail accepts input from the command itself. You'd probably have to output to a file then use the file as input when constructing your message.
[11:54] <Grant_P> Hi all, Have a Meridian Explorer DAC. I no longer have any sound. Any known issues with recent updates?
[11:55] <Deepfriedice> sydney: I'd just go for it. There isn't much point waiting for .1 if you're just going to upgrade to it anyway.

[11:58] <ronin> histo, I also have mail
[11:58] <ben_g> Hi
[11:58] <ronin> histo, just trying to put a command to cron and then email the output :)
[11:59] <ben_g> Does anyone here know how to fix random GPU freezes? (nvidia geforce 710M with the official nvidia drivers)
[11:59] <histo> ronin: cron will email the output unless you have it set not to.
[11:59] <ronin> hmm wehre is this configured
[11:59] <histo> ronin: it's part of crontab it will email any output and errors
[12:00] <ben_g> Or if those GPU freezes can't be fixed, is there a way to make it recover automatically when the GPU is unresponsive?
[12:00] <histo> ronin: set the MAILTO=youremail@test.com  in your crontab
[12:01] <ben_g> (currently, to recover, I have to press CTRL+AL+F1-F6, then CTRL+ALT+F7, and then everything works again)
[12:02] <histo> ben_g: try not using the nvidia drivers
[12:03] <ben_g> histo: it was the only way that made my computer use the nvidia graphics card, while not messing up everything
[12:03] <histo> ben_g: what was messed up with the open source drivers?
[12:04] <ben_g> the open-source drivers only work for my on-board GPU (which is a lot slower than my nvidia card)
[12:04] <ben_g> And I tried bumblebee once too, but with it, i had no graphics at all
[12:06] <histo> ben_g: ahh you have a dual video card setup... Perhaps try a different version of the driver from nvidia then.
[12:06] <ben_g> I tried the latest linux one, what version should I use then?
[12:07] <sj99> Hey. I'm running 14.05, and I have a monitor with a 2560x1440 resolution, however that resolution isn't available in system settings (the max is 1920x1080). Any help would be much appreciated.
[12:07] <max87> hi, am able to login to ubuntu but it shows 4 options including to run with low graphics mode
[12:07] <xvzf> hi there where can I download an iso image to install trusty tahr onto a macbook?
[12:07] <max87> but when i choose low graphics mode, it shows only commandline
[12:07] <ben_g> I use driver version 331.38-Linux-x86-64bit
[12:08] <robotdevil> how the heck is the nouveau driver configured? is there not an .rc file or something?
[12:08] <max87> i experimented, and changed to init 1. Then after , I were able to run to init 5 and graphics shown up correctly.
[12:08] <max87> but when the system is rebooted again the error shows up.
[12:08] <max87> how can i verify if this is related to graphics driver.
[12:08] <pavlos> sj99, the resolution depends on your video card, not the monitor
[12:10] <ben_g> Is there a way to just update the graphics drivers, instead of going trough the installation procedure again?
[12:10] <histo> ben_g: I don't know perhaps you'd have to ask nvidia for support with 'their' driver.
[12:10] <sj99> pavlos: samsung advertises it as 2560x1440 pixel resolution
[12:11] <histo> robotdevil: What do you mean by configured?
[12:11] <ben_g> Is there a way to write a script to reset it automatically when it's frozen? Maybe that's easier.
[12:11] <histo> ben_g: not quite sure how you'd detect that it's frozen.
[12:11] <pavlos> sj99, are you running 14.04? what video card do you have? again, the resolution depends on the video card, not the monitor.
[12:11] <histo> ben_g: What desktop environment are you running?
[12:12] <ben_g> Ubuntu 14.04
[12:12] <ben_g> LTS
[12:13] <histo> ben_g: it's possible something with X or unity is locking up. You could try a different DE for awhile like xfce, kde, lxde, etc.... and test
[12:13] <ben_g> Well, I do know that everything I do while it's frozen still has effect, the screen just doesn't show it
[12:14] <ben_g> Doesn't that mean it's only the GPU that causes problems?
[12:14] <robotdevil> ben_g: how does it know what options to run with if there is no xorg
[12:15] <ben_g> robotdevil: How do you mean? (sorry, I'm quite bad with linux)

[12:15] <Grant_P> Hi, I've noticed that my machine is not running the latest kernel installed (even after reboot). Any reason why?
[12:16] <sj99> pavlos: yep - 14.04. I have intel hd 4000 integrated graphics
[12:17] <Ben64> Grant_P: well what is installed, what is running, and what did you choose during grub?
[12:17] <ben_g> How can I set up a different DE (whatever that is) to see if it's causing the problem?
[12:17] <notas_> fake
[12:20] <ben_g> It seems that windows autorecovers from the GPU freezes I described by using TDR (Timeout Detection and Recovery).
[12:20] <ben_g> Is there a linux-alternative for this?
[12:21] <pavlos> sj99, so you need to go to the Intel site and d/l the driver ... https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads
[12:24] <sj99> pavlos: thanks, i've installed it and will reboot now

[13:13] <skrrp> Guest7100: install BSD. joking aside there are many small and big things you can do to secure your system. start with sshd_config. move the ssh port to a high number in the user range, disable root login. use nmap to scan your system for open ports (services). disable any you don't need. kill inetd if it's running. kill any insecure ftp programs. you might consider a firewall (shorewall) or...

[13:43] <holstein> nagios is an industry standard
[13:43] <SpecialEd> holstein: I agree, but is there a way to make it work so it shows like 1 second refresh ?
[13:43] <SpecialEd> for 6 servers?
[13:43] <SpecialEd> If so then Ill head over to #nagios
[13:44] <holstein> Stevie24: im just saying, if nagios didnt do what i wanted, id rethink what i want.. probably not necessary to have a 1 second refresh

=== daniel is now known as Guest10967
[13:45] <SpecialEd> holstein: therefore 1 minute refresh won't likely show spikes...
[13:46] <histo>  Stevie24 both grep and sed can use the -e for_pattern  so grep -i -e pattern1 -e pattern2 > somefile  sed -i -e 's/pattern1//g' -e 's/pattern2//g'

[13:51] <holstein> n1n0: what i would do is, remove the offending config from the users /home.. you can literally move *all* the .hidden .config files out of the way
[13:51] <n1n0> holstein would if i knew how
[13:51] <holstein> n1n0: new fresh default config files will be generated, then you can test login, and put back what you want/need
[13:52] <holstein> n1n0: if you knew what, friend? what to move? im saying, literally *anything* in the users /home that is a .config.. hidden with a dot
[13:53] <holstein> n1n0: you can elaborate as to what destkop you are using, and i could give more direct suggestions for specific hidden directories
[13:54] <holstein> n1n0: you can make a new user to move/delete these.. you can use a live CD.. regardless, you should backup your important data.. then, you know that you can do a fresh install and *not* keep the user data in place with the errors, and be ok.. you konw that its not a password problem
[13:55] <marscher> is there a way to let rsync only show those files, which will be transfered in a dry run?

[13:57] <marscher> I want only those files to be printed, which will be transfered (after application of exclude patterns)
[13:57] <n1n0> holstein thanx for the long info. some kind of link on how to do it would be very much appreciated
[13:57] <holstein> n1n0: with *any* filemanager, friend
[13:57] <histo> marscher: why do you want to do that?
[13:58] <marscher> histo, I have a backup, and want only to partially restore it. So I need a "diff" of files first
[13:58] <holstein> n1n0: what desktop environment are you using? with more informaiton, i can help you pinpoint what might be more specifically causing the issues.. otherwise, literally anything with a dot in front of it in your users home.. which you can access from any filemanager
[13:58] <marscher> a diff of the file list ideally
[13:58] <histo> marscher: diff /directory1 /directory2
[13:59] <marscher> histo, does this work recursively and for binary files?!
[13:59] <n1n0> holstein what is the command line in tty to tell you the desktop environment
[13:59] <n1n0> ?
[13:59] <holstein> n1n0: what do you have installed, friend? main ubuntu? xubuntu? lubuntu? kubuntu?
[13:59] <marscher> histo, a line by line comparision for 200k files would be total overkill, despite I only need to find out, which files has been deleted

[14:06] <holstein> n1n0: the link i gave has only terminal commands listed, friend.. have you opened it? and referenced it?
[14:06] <histo> marscher: using that if a only in results in a directory then it won't recurse further because there is no point. e.g. only in /dir1: somedir   then it won't go into somedir
[14:06] <holstein> n1n0: 13.10 *is* still supported, but you can reference the link i gave and see that the EOL is in july.. just next month
[14:07] <n1n0> holstein cannot access the terminal except from the guest
[14:07] <holstein> n1n0: you can login to your user account from tty
[14:07] <holstein> n1n0: there are recovery modes in the kernel as well..
[14:07] <holstein> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode
[14:08] <delac> any way to hide applications from Dash? Using Alacarte doesn't seem to have effect.
[14:08] <n1n0> did in tty, now it says n1n0(myusername which i cannot access)@lap (computer name
[14:08] <histo> marscher: also try with rsync -rnu dir1 dir2  should only show files that will be overwritten
[14:08] <n1n0> so that means the password is ok?
[14:08] <histo> marscher: -u is the key
[14:08] <holstein> n1n0: sure.. so run the commands *as* that user
[14:08] <n1n0> ok
[14:09] <holstein> n1n0: though, i personally think your time will be well spent backing up your data with a live CD, and doing a fresh install of 14.04 where you *dont* keep the offending user data in place during install

[14:10] <marscher> histo, thanks for all this information, but I currently noticed, that I cant perform any of them in my current environment, since I've mounted an btrfs image, which shares the same uuid like an already mounted volume....
[14:10] <marscher> and it seems, there is no way around this.
[14:11] <marscher> so I guess I first have to transfer all files from the backup image to another filesystem (which is superstupid... :()
[14:12] <histo> marscher: can't you mount by label?
[14:12] <marscher> histo, my research so far results, that the uuid is stored inherently in the filesystem(image)
[14:13] <marscher> and is not changeable
[14:13] <histo> marscher: how do you have matching uuid's what are you trying to do?
[14:13] <marscher> so how would a label change that?
[14:13] <marscher> trying to mount an image of my currently running system on a loopback device
[14:14] <histo> marscher: ahh
[14:14] <marscher> but because those uuids are the same (image and source), the mounted image shows exactly the same contents like current

[14:20] <k0nceast> marscher: tune2fs does not work on brtfs afaik
[14:20] <CREEEPEREXPLOSIV> hi
[14:21] <marscher> k0nceast, yes that is what one would expect

[14:26] <Guest19759> Hey, I have an Ubuntu live USB booted. I've installed some things and am wondering if I can make a persistant overlay with what I currently have? I googled around, but all I can find is stuff on creating the overlay, not saving current stuff to it. I know there must be some way, but I'm kinda stuck.
[14:27] <marscher> k0nceast, histo, there is no way documentated to perform this. So I will dump my files on another filesystem. Thank you both for your help/time!

[14:31] <k0nceast> Guest19759: it's a boot-time kernel option iirc
[14:31] <Guest19759> k0nceast: Yeah, but is there some way to just dump the changes to a file and then reboot from it?
[14:32] <k0nceast> depends on what you've changed
[14:32] <k0nceast> you could make a folder on your windrive and save all changed config files there

[14:35] <Guest19759> k0nceast: Yeah, the apps are mainly what I want to save. I know I could just re-add Universe and reinstall the stuff I've gotten, but I wonder if there's a way to create the persistant file and dump everything that's changed since boot or something
[14:36] <k0nceast> Guest19759: if you've added repo's for apps, then add the /etc/sources.list file and /etc/sources.d/ dir to the folder

[14:36] <k0nceast> /etc/dpkg/sources.list and .d respectively

[14:38] <k0nceast> Guest19759: and when installed, you could replace the content of the file in the install with the content of the files on your winpartition

[15:33] <Symphonym> About to do a fresh (re) install of Ubuntu but I always seem to forget what the commands were to boot a liveUSB from the grub2 command line, any help?
[15:33] <user123321> daftykins, just clean install, didn't do major changes intentionally, other than software update and some software installs.
[15:33] <TiLAK> Check this http://goo.gl/mSs3yj
[15:33] <user123321> daftykins, no. I installed the latest version.
[15:33] <daftykins> user123321: so due to said software update (== upgrade) you may have another kernel on
[15:34] <daftykins> user123321: either look for another or run memtest i'd say
[15:34] <sydney> How do i disable automatic login from ctrl+alt+f7?
[15:34] <paulus68> ActionParsnip: ?
[15:34] <user123321> daftykins, I see. But Ubuntu asks me to update right? hmm.
[15:34] <user123321> daftykins, I'd do memtest?
[15:34] <daftykins> user123321: what do you mean asks you to update?
[15:35] <user123321> daftykins, Ubuntu shows "new updates are available"
[15:35] <daftykins> but you said it's not booting...
[15:35] <user123321> daftykins, I make sure things are up to date.
[15:35] <pavlos> sydney, you could go System settings | users and groups and edit that user NOT to autologin
[15:35] <sydney> pavlos: In terminal*
[15:35] <user123321> daftykins, It didn't this morning for 2 consecutive times, but I booted successfully after. This is what freaking me out :/
[15:35] <daftykins> user123321: oh... i misunderstood, by hang you mean it just takes a lot longer
[15:36] <user123321> daftykins, I had to turn off manually.
[15:36] <histo> sydney: I told you edi thte lightdm.conf
[15:36] <daftykins> oh, you got in on the third go? :)
[15:36] <pavlos> sydney, well, someone said to comment out a line in lightdm.conf
[15:36] <sydney> histo: but,what do i type?
[15:36] <daftykins> user123321: yeah straight to memtest then. i don't diagnose anything until that's clean
[15:36] <histo> sydney: sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and disable the autologin-user
[15:36] <user123321> daftykins, Yes, I went to ubuntu recovery, it booted. Then did a restsrt, worked. But I'm scared because I don't know hy it happened, what if it happens again o.O
[15:37] <user123321> daftykins, Oh ok.
[15:38] <sydney> histo: what do i have to type to tell it to disable it?
[15:39] <sydney> histo: im in the editor,but i dont know what to type. :(
[15:39] <varunendra> sydney, the line "autologin-user=" is just that in my system (no auto login). So I guess just remove the user name in that line
[15:39] <histo> sydney: remove your user name or add a # in the front of that line then save the file
[15:41] <sydney> You guys are confusing. i dont see any words on the screen except the editor. is there supposed to be "autologin"somewhere?
[15:42] <sydney> i just have the editor,and a white blinking cursor
[15:42] <daftykins> sounds like you typo'd the file name
[15:42] <pavlos> sydney, there should be 4 lines ... change the autologin-user=sydney to autologin-user=    save, exit.
[15:43] <sydney> There is nothing there.
[15:43] <varunendra> sydney, does "cat /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf" show any lines? You must exit the editor to run this command.
[15:43] <sydney> Are you forgetting that im using ubuntu gnomes login manager? OR IS THERE NO DIFFERENCE?
[15:43] <daftykins> don't use caps.
[15:44] <sydney> sorry,i bumped it.
[15:44] <ActionParsnip> sydney: if you switched to gdm, you'll need the gdm.conf file
[15:44] <sydney> ok
[15:45] <varunendra> sydney, to see which one you have - "locate lightdm.conf gdm.conf"

[15:46] <eric_tux> I need help to correct a malfunction on a MacBook 5,1 with 14.04 installed

[15:46] <nick0R0> Hi
[15:47] <eric_tux> can someone help me, because this causes a real problem when I work for my job
=== turtle_ is now known as izm24snlp
[15:47] <sydney> sudo nano /ext/gdm/gdm.conf?
[15:47] <daftykins> /etc/
[15:48] <varunendra> sydney, is the file there? Check its contents with 'cat' first.
[15:48] <paulus68> ActionParsnip: could you help?
[15:48] <nick0R0> So...
[15:48] <varunendra> eric_tux, have you tried reloading the driver?
[15:48] <daftykins> paulus68: no need to hound one user
[15:48] <sydney> No,that didnt show as anytrhing
[15:48] <eric_tux> varunendra: how to do?
[15:49] <paulus68> daftykins:not my intention
=== james is now known as Guest12085
[15:50] <varunendra> eric_tux, just guessing here - the driver should be "psmouse", so the commands should be - "sudo modprobe -rv psmouse" ... then ... "sudo modprobe -v psmouse". The first one will disable it, the 2nd one should re-enable it, hopefully properly.
[15:50] <sydney> i wil dink around with it later. :)
[15:50] <paulus68> daftykins: just trying to find a solution that's all and I think Actionparsnip is old enough to tell me that he can't help me
[15:50] <nick0R0> ...How do you remove Ubuntu One (And the service "goodbye" message)??
[15:51] <daftykins> paulus68: asking a question to the whole channel might be more effective
[15:51] <pavlos> sydney, travel the /etc/gdm/ path and look for a conf file (in my case I have custom.conf) if you find it, edit using nano and disable the autologin
[15:51] <paulus68> daftykins: already did that actionparsnip started to reply then left which is not his normal behaviour
[15:52] <sireorion> hi all.. how do i terminate a program.... i cant shutdown wine
=== james_ is now known as Guest47660
[15:53] <eric_tux> varunendra: nop, kernel does not uses psmouse
[15:53] <varunendra> eric_tux, how did you check? lsmod?
[15:53] <eric_tux> the first -rv command does nothing
=== Guest5757 is now known as cassio3
[15:53] <eric_tux> then I -v , got insmod psmouse
[15:54] <eric_tux> -rv got rmmod psmouse
[15:54] <eric_tux> so I guess the psmouse wasn't loaded the first time
[15:54] <varunendra> eric_tux, I would like to see the outputs of (pastebin links of) "xinput" and "lsmod"
[15:54] <paulus68> I just bought a samsung S24D300 and want to use it as dual screen how do I do this, at the mm
[15:55] <paulus68> moment it's connected through hdmi but no signal from pc
[15:55] <eric_tux> varunendra: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7664317/
[15:58] <varunendra> eric_tux, apparently it is "BCM5974". You may try replacing 'psmouse' with 'bcm5974' in the modprobe commands. But I have no experience with it, so can't say if it may cause any troubles forcing you to reboot.
[15:59] <eric_tux> is bcm5974 linked with the wifi card? I think that wifi or network is part of the problem
[16:00] <varunendra> eric_tux, it is touchpad driver, not wifi
[16:01] <eric_tux> ok fine I'll test next time I have the problem and we append a comment to my bug report
[16:01] <eric_tux> s /we/will/
[16:01] <eric_tux> verunendra thanks
[16:02] <varunendra> eric_tux, you may also try 'xinput float bcm5974' command combo, which is a bit safer. (xinput float bcm5974.... then .... xinput reattach bcm5974 Virtual core pointer)
[16:03] <eric_tux> ok
[16:03] <jhutchins> ubuntu.org is expired and awaiting renewal?

[16:04] <varunendra> eric_tux, a correction - the "Virtual core pointer" must be in single or double quotes, since it has spaces in the name. :)
[16:04] <eric_tux> On my laptop I have 8Go RAM installed, is it normal to find more than 6Go used reported by top (when this problem arrives), swap is totally free?
[16:05] <varunendra> eric_tux, totally normal. The used RAM is used for buffers

[16:08] <Slappy> ok, I been using Linux as my primary desktop os for a couple of years now but I have a problem
[16:08] <Slappy> EVERY SINGLE TIME I install a distro, it is buggy at best, problematic at worst & after only a few months, gets so damn buggy that I have to reinstall it
[16:09] <pavlos> Slappy, no reason for caps
[16:09] <Slappy> Is there ANY Linux distro that I can just install & have work without issue?
[16:09] <kittykitty> anyone know much about HDD noises? :P
[16:10] <caser555> Yes.  When it makes a noise, throw it away and get a new one.
