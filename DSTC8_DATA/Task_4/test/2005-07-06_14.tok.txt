<s> to ubuntu </s>
<s> <user> , how do you fix it ? </s>
<s> its <unka> me problme </s>
<s> <user> : for example if i try doing apt-get install mplayer </s>

<s> <user> <unka[_~> <unk#a-.@]_> has left #ubuntu [ ] </s>
<s> ok now </s>
<s> you ca n't just take ie out and <unka/> . right ? </s>
<s> <user> : i 've usually let ipcop deal with <unka/> forwarding issues for me . perhaps today i will learn how to do it myself </s>
<s> with linux , you can pull any component out , look at it , fix it , config it , etc . </s>
<s> <user> : use aptitude , its better for <unka-> , you should do " sudo aptitude search <unka> " </s>
<s> so a : windows is simply a poor set of tools </s>

<s> but it also is b : a set of gui wizards that automate most basic tasks </s>
<s> <user> : i think that my x is configured properly , i would like to reinstall it .. how do i do it </s>

<s> <user> : reinstall it or just reconfigure it ? </s>
<s> reisntall </s>
<s> that you can operate something as complicated as an os with no training learning <unka/> at all </s>
<s> <user> : sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg for reconfiguring </s>
<s> and that simply is not true </s>
<s> <user> : i confess i 've never done it in linux land ( i 'm a bsd guy , i 've only just come back to linux ). but the <unka> involved are universal </s>

<s> i am trying it now </s>
<s> <user> , as well , 'just works' and 'just get something done' is highly subjective </s>
