[15:01] <gos> Hi, if i have adware tracking cookie on linux how can remove it?
[15:01] <dariopnc> c3l: thank you for the suggestion but i'm trying to interact with empathy to change the login status
[15:01] <arvind_k> robyromania, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1180170
[15:02] <crazydiamond> And can I fire the same process that runs on boot and writes all the lines with [ OK ] and [fail]?
[15:02] <fake51> anyone with an idea why the cache for bind9 is only hit when I run screen and not when running normally?
[15:02] <c3l> Somelauw: strange, well its got to be something with firefox. try fixing it the ugly way, completly wipe firefox and reinstall it :)
[15:02] <c3l> Somelauw: I have no ideas otherwise sorry

[15:02] <gos> Hi if i have adware tracking cookie on linux how can detect it and remove it?
[15:03] <fake51> gos, use your browsers options to clear cookies
[15:03] <babu> #mysql
[15:03] <robyromania> arvind_k, i've been through that. those steps are for karmic. i have no problems in karmic, it goes much easier than in that post
[15:03] <quilby> anyone here?
[15:03] <quilby> where is xorg.conf in ubuntu 10.10?
[15:03] <arvind_k> robyromania, its for lucid
[15:03] <quilby> its not in /etc/X11
[15:03] <mindloss> anyone know anything about setfont? i've got a weird problem
[15:04] <Somelauw> c3l, well thanks for your ideas.
[15:04] <robyromania> arvind_k, the posts are so old..
[15:04] <arvind_k> robyromania, sorry, dint see that
[15:05] <gos> fake51 its adware tracking cookie hidden that is not removed by the cleaner firefox
[15:05] <storm_zen> Where is a good place to ask a question about encrypted partitions not booting?  In particular, /dev/disk/by-uuid seems to be missing.
[15:05] <fake51> gos, a cookie is a browser thing
[15:06] <mindloss> i used setfont on one of my virtual (ctrl+alt+f4) terminals to change the font, and now my typing is getting randomly replaced by underscores -- the actual letter typed is the same, but it displays on the screen as an underscore. any idea how to fix this, or reset things?
[15:06] <KE1HA> storm_zen, I think you just asked in a good place. If anyone knows the answer they will speak up Im sure.
[15:06] <Pici> quilby: xorg.conf has been optional for a few releases now.  Maverick questions belong in #ubuntu+1 though.
[15:07] <quilby> pici: ok thanks
[15:07] <gos> fake51, adware tracking cookie is injected into the flash player
[15:08] <fake51> gos, find your flash players tmp directory then, most likely place for it
[15:08] <bazhang> gos, that is not an ubuntu issue, but an adobe one; go to their website and set it there
[15:09] <Xpistos> Is there a way I can create a .txt file of all the software i have installed?
[15:09] <arvind_k> robyromania, file a bug
[15:10] <jrib> Xpistos: why...?
[15:10] <guampa> Xpistos: dpkg --get-selections > textfile.txt

[15:12] <arvind_k> robyromania, np. couldnt be of much help

[15:13] <venik> java is not working properly in ANY of my browsers
[15:13] <Nijverheid> on a ubuntu server, I change /etc/motd with sudo, but it keeps changing it back to the original >_> how do I stop it from doing this?
[15:13] <sipior> venik: have you installed the plugin?
[15:13] <venik> I have Icedtea
[15:13] <abhijit> guampa, just can you tell me what the apt-get dselect-upgrade will do?

[15:14] <Xpistos> guampa: thanks. It wasn't auto completeing so i thought it was going to work
[15:14] <llutz> Nijverheid: should work on ubuntu too
[15:14] <venik> which plugin do I need?
[15:14] <Nijverheid> llutz: cheers
[15:14] <guampa> abhijit: it will install all the packages selected by the previous "dpkg --set-selections"
[15:15] <abhijit> guampa, ok
[15:15] <sipior> venik: icedtea6-plugin, i believe
[15:16] <Nijverheid> llutz: thing is... it's not even rebooting and the motd changes
[15:16] <Nijverheid> which is what is throwing me
[15:16] <gos> bazhang, the adware tracking cookie Can violate your online privacy also with Linux or Windows only?
[15:17] <venik> can't find icedtea*
[15:17] <yashi-> gos: cookies work everywhere
[15:18] <bazhang> venik, enable partner repo
[15:18] <sipior> venik: what does "apt-cache search icedtea" report?
[15:18] <bazhang> !partner | venik
[15:18] <ubottu> venik: Canonical's partner repositories provide packages a location for software vendors to publish applications. The repo itself can be added by running this in a !terminal: « sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner" »

[15:20] <gos> Yashi then I'm super polluted by the adware tracking cookie using linux and I have no tools to remove it
[15:20] <bazhang> gos, I already told you what to do
[15:20] <plitter> Hey, when i mount a heroes of might and magic 3 iso cd all the filenames ends with ;1 is there a way to change that?
[15:22] <gos> bazhang where is for linux a ccleaner or a superantispyware or similar for linux?

[15:24] <abhijit> guampa, ok
[15:24] <gos> bazhang but if i have adware traclking cookie ....
[15:24] <storm_zen> Last night I used PGP full disk encryption to encrypt the disk from inside a Windows partition.  ( As the software is meant to do. ) ... the problem is that now I can't boot into my usual encrypted Lucid environment.  I'm not sure how to fix this.  Grub2 is complaining and listing a UUID ( I can't see what the entire error message is because it is going off the screen. )  .. how do I fix this?
[15:24] <KE1HA> gos, go to ubuntu-offtopic  bazhang is there to talk to you
[15:26] <KE1HA> storm_zen, I saw ur post earlier, is this a widows ap, or linux app that did the PGP encrypt?
[15:27] <KE1HA> or in other words, how did you encrypt this partition.
[15:27] <storm_zen> PGP Desktop, a Windows program.
[15:28] <storm_zen> KE1HA: ... but not a partition encryption... a full disk encryption..
[15:28] <KE1HA> storm_zen, ok, and you encrypted the partition Post UB installation ?
[15:28] <storm_zen> I encrypted the disk post encrypted Ubuntu installation.
[15:28] <acarr> howdy
[15:29] <KE1HA> storm_zen, I need to think on that one fer a bit, but I dont think you'll get through the encryption layer with a bootloader, but could be wrong.
[15:29] <storm_zen> KE1HA: Would such a thing change the UUID of the partition?  That seems to be my issue.
[15:30] <storm_zen> KE1HA: I had Karmic running successfully Linux encrypted partition + PGP Desktop full disk encryption on top of it.
[15:32] <acarr> Some help..?  :) I recently left the gnome world for kde... however, I can not seem to get KDE to remember my video settings.  I have read forum after forum and tried fix after fix.  Any suggestions?  I have 2 25 inch acers.  I am running kubuntu 10.04.  I have a nvidia gs 7200.
[15:32] <KE1HA> storm_zen, I'm not familiar with the app your referring too, I've not used it, nor can I see a reason for it, but that's here nor there. Can you use this windows app to remove this encryption ?
[15:33] <storm_zen> KE1HA: In theory, yes.  But that's not my first choice:  It's a 10 hour commitment to do so.
[15:33] <Sangeeth> I'm using my college's wifi to connect to internet... I must give username and password for every session of any browser... Thus, it is not possible for me to update through terminal... Is there a way that i could enter the username and password of my wifi connection in the terminal...
[15:35] <arvind_k> Sangeeth, use tabbed browsing
[15:35] <acarr> Some help..?  :) I recently left the gnome world for kde... however, I can not seem to get KDE to remember my video settings.  I have read forum after forum and tried fix after fix.  Any suggestions?  I have 2 25 inch acers.  I am running kubuntu 10.04.  I have a nvidia gs 7200.
[15:35] <KE1HA> storm_zen, I can't tell you how Grub2 is reacting to the encryption layer, I just don't, and to try and fix this from within the Linux environment, make cause all sorts of issues. Many things have changed from Karmic to Lucid.

[15:37] <Kai69> thanks ^^
[15:37] <bazhang> venik, you enabled partner repo?
[15:37] <storm_zen> KE1HA: I wasn't looking to make any changes other than config changes.  I wanted to see if I could figure out a way to manually boot into the partition... to start, where is it getting the UUID that is in the error message?
[15:38] <storm_zen> KE1HA: I tried booting into rescue, but blkid returns nothing.
[15:38] <KE1HA> storm_zen, My recommendation would be to go to the PGP Windows people and ask them how to fix the problem, as you asking Linux folks to understand what a Windows app is doing to a Linux machine :-) wow that's interesting.

[15:41] <felicity> manu__: lol, a fail hat, as in "fail", for being silly
[15:41] <KE1HA> storm_zen, it seems the root cause was the secondardy encrypt, beyond that Im out of suggesitons.
[15:41] <manu__> i just installed some ttf fonts by just opening them

I also added standard admin users for the share, and here is wwhere it beg
[15:46] <Xyh> <Xyh> ins: I can read the file as domain admin, but can't delete it. From the linux server I can do it without a problem. I am using ebox 1.4.2 with Samba 3.4.

[15:58] <Sangeeth> bazhang: So, i can't update through terminal as i don't login into the network with my username and password... Is there any ways to enter my username and password at terminal...
[15:59] <babigeneric> hi guys, I have set up Samba4 on ubuntu 10 and bind9 is setup as primary dns server, I have another primary dns server running on windows 2003 r2 which contains all the correct dns settings, is there a way to migrate the dns entries from windows to ubuntu on bind9
[15:59] <RainRain> installed alltray but it's not working - when i click on the new icon which it creates in the tray nothing happens
[15:59] <shayaknyc> Frater: I'm not sure I understand what you're asking
[15:59] <Meraxupypr> arvind_k, thx, but i need make share on windows, not linux
[15:59] <Nikie> as said, I'm new to Linux & ubuntu. Infact, this is for the first time i'm using ubuntu..:-s
[15:59] <abhijit> Nikie, cant help. its linux. if you help yourself then only others will be able to help you.
[15:59] <bazhang> Sangeeth, its browser based? then I would guess not
[15:59] <scampbell> BlaDe^: Are you trying to compile something against it, you need to load the -dev package then.
[15:59] <shayaknyc> I'm currently in Windows 7, and am trying to VPN into my ubuntu machine (which I am SSH'd into)
[15:59] <Guest39752> hi all!  every time i use apt-get install he wants to configure  zephyr-clients  but i like to remove it from apt ... whats the solution?
[15:59] <abhijit> Nikie, if you are new then its very necessary for you to learn. dont tell others to do your homework
[16:00] <BlaDe^> ah okay scampbell
[16:00] <Nikie> oops ! homework ?
[16:00] <Sangeeth> bazhang: Ya...whenever i open the browser i have to enter the username and password... IS there any way that i could update through the terminal...
[16:00] <scampbell> babigeneric: make your bind server a slave to ms server, tell ms server your linux server is allowed zone transfers.  Bring up bind and query and name.  Bind will bring copies of the dns over, change the domain in bind from slave to master.  You're done.
[16:00] <Nikie> I've gone through the ubuntu forums..n posted a few threads..n entered here to seek some guidance..
[16:00] <bazhang> Sangeeth, I'd say no. try to contact your school network admin
[16:00] <jellow> Guest39752: sudo apt-get remove zephr-cli* --purge ?
[16:00] <abhijit> i am loosing my tempor now. so i set him on ignore for some time now.
[16:01] <KE1HA> Nikie, there are allot of New User Information sources besides the IRC channel, if you'd like to read up on things we can provide you with the right links.
[16:01] <BlaDe^> scampbell:  sudo apt-cache search gstreamer0.10-plugin | grep dev doesn't return anything
[16:01] <BlaDe^> there's good/bad/ugly etc but no dev
[16:01] <scampbell> BlaDe^: one sec, lemme look what they called it
[16:01] <BlaDe^> there's base-apps too, is that what I want?
[16:01] <Frater> shayaknyc: Well, you have the server and the client side. What is the error message on the client when you try to connect. What does the logfiles say on the server after you tried to connect.
[16:02] <shayaknyc> Frater: checking now
[16:02] <babigeneric> thanks scampbell thats what i was wondering if it is at all possible to do that so all i need is to change the line in the zone file from slave to master
[16:02] <Nikie> I just would like to you to understand the problem i've encountered, n help if you had already come across this scenario before..
[16:02] <scampbell> BlaDe^:  apt-cache search gstreamer | grep dev   shows me libgstreamer0.10-dev
[16:03] <Nikie> That's all !
[16:03] <BlaDe^> scampbell:  I have that already
[16:03] <scampbell> babigeneric: yep, once you got the copy it's yours.
[16:03] <babigeneric> once the zone has been updated
[16:03] <Sangeeth> bazhang: Why?..  Is there any way?..
[16:03] <Nikie> so, you could help me..anyway, thank you for your time !
[16:03] <BlaDe^> plugins must have a different dev package but I don't know which one
[16:03] <bazhang> Sangeeth, from the terminal? no.
=== guampa is now known as superwhat
[16:03] <Sangeeth> Hi all... I need some support at connecting to a wifi network... Some one help please...
[16:03] <scampbell> BlaDe^: sorry,  libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev  but if you do that apt-get search gstreamer | grep dev  you'll see it and others that you may run into needing.
[16:03] <Sangeeth> bazhang: :(
[16:04] <babigeneric> Scampbell you are fantastic a million thanks
[16:04] <bazhang> Sangeeth, I just told you you cannot; why are you still asking?
[16:04] <shayaknyc> Frater: Error 800: The remote connection was not made because the attempted VPN tunnerls failed. The VPN serber might be unreachable. If this connection is attemtpting to use L2TP/IPsec tunner, the security parameters required for IPsec negotion might not be properly configured
[16:04] <BlaDe^> okay thanks a lot scampbell!
[16:04] <shayaknyc> Frater: but I'm not trying to use LT2Sec
[16:04] <KE1HA> Nikie, I don't know, I missed what your exact problem is?
[16:04] <shayaknyc> Frater: L2TP*
[16:04] <Sangeeth> bazhang: Enthusiasm, agony :(
[16:05] <Frater> shayaknyc: And you did of course check the configuration is the same for the security things, and you also made sure the pptpd is running and listening for incoming calls, right?

[16:06] <Nikie> Kelha - Initially when i installed ubuntu 10.04 on virtual Machine, it was able to detect the wireless network and got connected to it automatically...However, when i've installed ubuntu as a dual OS, it has detected the wireless network but is not getting connected.
[16:06] <yeabean> ubuntu can install
[16:06] <shayaknyc> Frater: as far as I know, the server is running fine, how do I go about checking to make sure it works? is there a way to log in locally from commandline?

[16:07] <shayaknyc> Frater: no worries...thanks for your help...if you could even point me in the right direction, I'd be MUCH obliged
[16:07] <hareldvd> just downloaded a package using apt-get install --download_only package. Where is the file?
[16:08] <arvind_k> hareldvd, probably in your home folder
[16:08] <hareldvd> arvind_k, I was lucky. found it in /var/cache/apt/archives
[16:09] <guampa> hareldvd: /var/cache/apt/archives
[16:09] <Nikie> harldvd, home folder or guess in your downloads directory
[16:09] <KE1HA> Nikie, sri but Im not a wireless expret, but for these guys to help they will need the Wireless card information etc.
[16:09] <Frater> shayaknyc:  Hm, i ran into the following problems.... IPTABLES blocked GRE ports (needed for PPTP). PPTP server was not started (ps aux | grep pptpd). Masquerading in IPTABLES; if you use it, has to be configured correctly...
[16:09] <Nikie> Yep, i can provide that..:)
[16:10] <j_ayen_green> running lucid. this morning, the screen was black, and I couldn't get a response. It's running in vbox, so after about 45 minutes, I just shut it down. It turns out that it was doing a full backup, because I had forgotten to mount the network drive where the backups are kept, so it was treating the mount point as a local directory, found no interim backups, and so began a full. Is there some...
[16:10] <j_ayen_green> ...way to get a response when something like that is going on, a linux version of ctl-alt-del?
[16:10] <nEw2be> i am getting locale error how to fix that LANGUAGE UNSET ; LOCAL ALL UNSET error
[16:10] <shayaknyc> frater: my iptables are configged properly (i believe) and pptpd is running :(
[16:11] <Nixie> Hey :)
[16:11] <Nixie> I need some help here, can I get any support here
[16:11] <Nixie> ? :)
[16:11] <j_ayen_green> ask the question, not if you can ask a question
[16:11] <scampbell> j_ayen_green: trick for the future.  Remove all permissions on the mountpoints (when they aren't mounted).  chmod a-rwx /mountpoint.   When mounted it will have whatever permissions the media wants, when not it's untouchable so that sort thing stands right up instead of hosing all your disk space.
[16:11] <`oi> eh what is the best distro on the earth and.. on the moon?
[16:12] <LoRez> `oi: seriously.
[16:12] <Pici> `oi: If you're expecting any other answer than Ubuntu, then you should be asking in ##linux, not here.
[16:12] <scampbell> Nixie: just ask your question and we'll see if someone here knows how to help you.
[16:12] <Nixie> In dockbarx nautilus doesn't show up :) how can I make it show up, nautilus shows up in default window list, what do I Need to do?
[16:12] <slow-motion> bye
[16:12] <Pici> `oi: And even then....
[16:12] <j_ayen_green> scampbell: thanks, great tip. aside from that, when a process like that is running and linux won't respond..is there a way to force some response?
[16:13] <ranjan> Hi all my Ubuntu machine fully updated is not showing the plymouth :( and sometimes it shows for just a split second. any workaround??
[16:13] <scampbell> j_ayen_green: my guess is that you ran out of disk space for crucial needs, it's very difficult for me to guess the exact situation.  My flailing attempt would be ctrl-alt-f1 for a text screen and see if I can unfsck things from there.
[16:14] <Nixie> In dockbarx nautilus doesn't show up :) how can I make it show up, nautilus shows up in default window list, what do I Need to do to make it show up in dockbarx?
[16:14] <Oer> ranjan your pc boots too fast ? i don't have a solution for that.
[16:14] <Oer> Nixie dockbar use compiz, do you have compiz enabled ?
[16:15] <ranjan> Oer, if that was the situation i would be happy ...but here booting is also slower :(

=== nilsa5 is now known as nilsa5_

[16:15] <bazhang> luka, installed pavucontrol padevchooser yet?
[16:15] <j_ayen_green> scampbell: no, wasn't out of disk space...I'm only using about 10 gig out of 50. I was watching the process monitor in windows (the host) while this was going on, and it was a lot of disk action, the occasional network action (reading a different networked drive that it includes in the backup) and about 80% cpu...so it was active, it was a matter of the screen saver wouldn't respond and clear
=== nilsa5_ is now known as nilsa5
[16:16] <luka> bazhang, no... what's that?

=== sshc_ is now known as sshc
[16:17] <BlaDe^> no but I want to make the partition and install it in ubuntu
[16:17] <ikonia> BlaDe^: ok - it's nothing to do with ubuntu
[16:17] <ikonia> BlaDe^: you can use gparted to make a partition though
[16:18] <BlaDe^> okay thanks
[16:18] <luka> bazhang, I need to redirect sound from my notebook speakers to line in jack 'couse my line out jack is dead
[16:18] <bazhang> !gparted > BlaDe^
[16:18] <ubottu> BlaDe^, please see my private message
[16:19] <scampbell> j_ayen_green: Don't know, the evidence given was that a backup process was writing to the wrong place and your system became unresponsive.  I've seen the  screen saver and X in general lock up hard for disk space issues before. If that's not the case for you then we are just playing darwinian pool :)
[16:19] <luka> bazhang, any idea?
[16:20] <bazhang> luka, I'd suggest trying with those first
[16:20] <scampbell> er, darwinian pool:  You are given a pool table with the balls in the pockets you must tell us how they got there .
[16:21] <eNew>  usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed
[16:21] <luka> bazhang, ok I installed it but dunno how to set it
[16:21] <luka> :)
[16:21] <eNew> how can i solve this&
[16:21] <eNew> please help
[16:21] <bazhang> luka, right click add to panel and adjust there
[16:21] <scampbell> j_ayen_green: I can say that in the specific case of the locked screensaved it's goign to be extremely difficult to get around that if it's failed.  It's designed just for that.  Personally, I don't allow screen saver or screen locks to happen on my servers as a matter of safety.
[16:22] <j_ayen_green> scampbell: well, it's that it was backing up what is 20% of the total disk space available, so I don't know how that could have filled it.  I shut down the host, rebooted, and then received a fail message on the mount, because the mount point now had files in it, a good share of the full backup, and the deja dup gave me a popup saying the backup had failed for unknown reasons. I presume...
[16:22] <j_ayen_green> ...based on the activity that it was still cruising along doing the backup, and that had the system pegged
[16:22] <Nikie> Ke1ha, i've wireless card info...
[16:22] <OneMillionDollar> is there a way to check how many time someone try to log on to my ubuntu pc ?
[16:22] <OneMillionDollar> is there a log recording this ?
[16:22] <Seveas-train> OneMillionDollar, /var/log/auth.log
[16:23] <Seveas-train> OneMillionDollar, and /var/log/daemon.log for ssh
[16:23] <unimatrix> Is there a way to force nautilus to always sort folders by name? Like how Windows file browser behaves by default ?
[16:23] <nEw2be> locale unset error need fix in 10.04
[16:23] <dmaxx> need some help here 2 with the directions...what channal is it best 2 go 2 if i need help with linux itself ?
[16:23] <aeon-ltd> dmaxx: #linux maybe?
[16:23] <luka> bazhang, dunno where are setting for choosing output jack
[16:24] <stercor> Does Ubuntu have a GUI for firewall management tool?
[16:24] <aeon-ltd> stercor: gufw
[16:24] <scampbell> j_ayen_green: likely so.  It's just terribly difficult to debug a situation like that, you can comb the logs for evidence of the issue but if some resource exhaustion occured there a pretty good likelyhood it didn't make it to the logs anyway. :(
[16:24] <eNew> How to fix /usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed? How to install these modules&
[16:24] <Nikie> wireless network detected but not getting connected..
[16:24] <stercor> aeon-ltd: hanks
[16:24] <dmaxx> i must have a invite it say aeon-ltd
[16:24] <aeon-ltd> stercor: your welcome
[16:24] <Nikie> folks any help..?
[16:24] <RainRain> cant get alltray working - can anybody help me - i have it installed but it just wont do what it's supposed to
[16:25] <hareldvd> How do I force download of a package if the package is already up to date?
[16:25] <profxavier> hareldvd, what package and why ?
[16:25] <trism> hareldvd: aptitude download package_name; will download it to the current directory if that is what you want
[16:25] <j_ayen_green> scampbell: I've noticed in the past that the photo slide show screen saver sometimes just sits there black, and that it's sometimes slow to respond to a mouse click, to clear itself. I wonder if the system being pegged like that and the screen saver having (presumably) a very low priority was a fatal situation
[16:26] <scampbell> j_ayen_green: that's one form a resource exhaustion.  Perhaps a message queue got stuffed by the backup software trying to complain about the situation, I could make up others but they're all without evidence :(
[16:27] <dmaxx> anyway i have manages 2 cloned wrong driver into a the drive i was gonna to clone with g4l and now the HDD is wiped from info and is replaced with the g4l itself,i kind of need it get bk as i have 5 year of work there xD
[16:27] <nilsa5> stercor: ufw firewall has a gui install it with: sudo apt-get install gufw
[16:27] <carandraug> Hi! I'm writing an extension for firefox. Since it I'm writing it from the ground up, is it possible to write it in a way to make it compatible (or easy to port for) with Google chrome. has anyone attempted to do do something like this? Any link for a web page about it?
[16:27] <scampbell> carandraug: I don't think the #ubuntu channel can tell you much about that. Perhaps ask in a firefox channel about such programming.
[16:28] <stercor> nilsa5: I've installed gufw.  Is that the one you mentioned?
[16:28] <j_ayen_green> scampbell: could be. I'm of the opinion for some reason that the backup software was having no problem, since it had already created numerous full backup volumes and had plenty of disk space left, but that I just couldn't get to the desktop because of the screen saver being in the way
[16:28] <nilsa5> stercor: yes
[16:29] <luka> #ubuntu GUYS I NEED HELP FOR REDIRECTING SOUND OUTPUT TO LINE IN JACK(BLUE ONE) BECAUSE LINE OUT JACK(GREEN ONE) IS DEAD!
[16:29] <carandraug> scampbell, thanks. I asked ubuntu-app-devel but got no answer there. I'm so used to look only into the ubuntu community that it never ocurred me to ask firefox
[16:29] <scampbell> j_ayen_green: You would certainly have a better feel for it they I would from this distance :)   I stand by my statement that screen savers don't belong on servers.
[16:29] <abhijit> !caps | luka
[16:29] <ubottu> luka: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[16:29] <flomaster> I am getting this error when trying to run  sudo apt-get update   sudo apt-get upgrade   my pastebin>>>>> http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/0gqU9XF6
[16:30] <j_ayen_green> scampbell: well, you have my vote now. i'll look for a desktop slideshow instead of the screensaver :)
[16:30] <doodom> hi everybody
[16:30] <dmaxx> .... still need some advice here u know -_-
[16:30] <luka> #ubuntu guys i need help for redirecting sound output to line in jack (blue one) because line out jack(green one) is dead. it's lower case, will someone answer now?
[16:30] <nilsa5> stercor: you can try firestarter instead(its a another firewall): https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Firestarter
[16:31] <dmaxx> tought firestarter is not that good option after what i mean-_-
[16:31] <luka> anyone? I asked in lowercase o.O that's important
[16:32] <dmaxx> yo luka stand in line/?/
[16:32] <dmaxx> xD
[16:32] <scampbell> luka: line in is for input, line out and speaker out would be for output.  Both line out and speaker out are likely outputting by default, however, line out is a signifcantly lower voltage.  You might try alsamixer to ensure the individual volumes are turned up but line out and speaker out or not interchangable electronically.
[16:32] <Quantum_Ion> lol@stand in line
[16:33] <luka> scampbell, with windows I managed that with realtek hd audio manager
[16:33] <wwwwwwwwwwwwww> is there an easy way to switch between network interface settigns?
[16:33] <dmaxx> nooow that is answer,could some pretty pretty please with cherry on top give a little lost guy like me a little help maybe?
[16:33] <dmaxx> xD
[16:34] <j_ayen_green> scampbell: so what's ctl-alt-f1 do? I just did it, to try, and the screen went blank and asked for a login, which I gave, and now it's just sitting there
[16:34] <scampbell> luka: then try alsamixer, if the voltage is sufficient for your need fine, just wanted you to be aware of the electronic issue there.
[16:34] <BluesKaj> !ask | dmaxx
[16:34] <ubottu> dmaxx: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
[16:35] <scampbell> dmaxx: If you have a disk image perhaps you can mount it on another system.  I don't use ghost so I don't know what it put on the backup disk really.
[16:35] <j_ayen_green> scampbell: ah, now I appear to be at the command ine
[16:35] <dmaxx> i know that without u  blue gonna tell the bot 2 tell me xD
[16:35] <j_ayen_green> *line
[16:35] <luka> scampbell, man... i just want my speakers play when i turn them in blue jack
[16:35] <luka> :D
[16:35] <Oer> luka laptop ?
[16:35] <luka> not notebook speakers but those real one with subs
[16:35] <luka> :)
[16:36] <luka> Oer, yes
[16:36] <scampbell> luka: you can change in the individual volumes of the various outputs on your sound card up and down with alsamixer.   why not give it a try?
[16:36] <dmaxx> what i mean scampbell i need 2 find a way 2 get bk all the files and stuff that a clone software whave removed,any good software for that??
[16:36] <duffydack> isnt today 10.04.1 day?
[16:36] <Friar> how do I know if TRIM is working with my SSD? I upgraded to 2.6.33 kernel, and I have changed my fstab file.
[16:36] <Oer> luka, there are some issues with laptops with no line out working.
[16:37] <dmaxx> except testdisk???
[16:37] <scampbell> j_ayen_green: ctrl_alt_f1 switches you to the text screen, no gui at all.  ctrl-alt-f7 (or 8 depending on your installation) will take you back to the graphical.
[16:37] <luka> scampbell, i did but only notebook speakers work...
[16:37] <R\Peaceman> I am desperate, and searching for someone who can help me with permissions in ubuntu, (ProFTPD and Samba)
[16:37] <j_ayen_green> scampbell: ah! thanks :)
[16:37] <scampbell> j_ayen_green: be aware that a locked screen saver will disallow that action so you can't get out of it that way. another reason why I think screensavers are bad.
[16:37] <luka> Oer, thaks man you made my day
[16:37] <luka> :)
[16:37] <luka> xD
[16:38] <Oer> luka did you google ubuntu + laptopname + laptop typ  + line out ?

[16:43] <prakash-567> its awesome
[16:43] <bazhang> jpds, already got it here
[16:43] <mrdk> How to uncompile java gcc into ghc piped thorugh xterm in bash via vb.NET (and I want the god damn makefile for it)
[16:43] <djzn> bazhang: what do you got there
[16:43] <navneeth> Hi 10.04 user here... I'm not able to group windows using compiz for some reason. Can someone help?
[16:43] <bazhang> prakash-567, thats not supported here, hence offtopic
[16:43] <bazhang> djzn, 10.04.1
[16:43] <djzn> bazhang: where did you get the iso
[16:44] <sipior> mrdk: that was quite a string of gibberish.
[16:44] <tseug> Hi, I'm testing a program in a terminal.  How can I enter a "newline" in the terminal?  Pressing the Enter key submits my text.  Is there a key combination like Ctrl+Enter, or something, to make a newline?
[16:44] <bazhang> djzn, not the iso. just apt-get upgrade
[16:44] <djzn> bazhang: i am not talking about updates.... i am talking about installing it in 40 machines... without having to do anything
[16:44] <Seveas-train> sipior, impressively almost-coherent though :)
[16:44] <sipior> Seveas-train: perhaps he works in management
[16:44] <mrdk> sipior: no, really not
[16:44] <mrdk> sipior: my brother wanted to know
[16:44] <bazhang> djzn, ah, then what jpds said
[16:44] <kiamo> what torrent clients do people recommend?  transmission is causing my system to freeze :(
[16:44] <mrdk> sipior: help me
[16:44] <Seveas-train> ah, the brother argument....
[16:45] <bazhang> !torrent > kiamo
[16:45] <ubottu> kiamo, please see my private message
[16:45] <mrdk> sipior: plz
[16:45] <milko> hi!
[16:45] <misha> Hi folks. I'm running LL, and on a regular basis my system hangs. It just quits responding to everything (network contacts, too), and the only way to fix the problem is a reboot through the power button. I've poked around in syslog for some solutions to the problem, but found nothing out of the ordinary. Any other log or similar place I should go to, to get som hints to the roots of the problem?
[16:45] <milko> I have a problem when I want to install ubuntu 10.4
[16:45] <sipior> mrdk: you might try using coherent language. that will make it easier for both of us.
[16:45] <navneeth> tseug: \ and then hit Enter
[16:45] <abhijit> !details | milko
[16:45] <ubottu> milko: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[16:45] <milko> I have my disk with the partitions, but the ubuntu installar doesn't recognize these
[16:46] <mrdk> sipior: isn't my question sophisticated enough for a toilet cleaner like you?
[16:46] <Seveas-train> mrdk, you get linker to thwirble the objectcode and then it's a matter of degrubbing the results with a preprocessor
[16:46] <milko> the strange thing is that when I open nautilus
[16:46] <yashi-> misha: are you using a notebook?
[16:46] <milko> all partitiones are there
[16:46] <bazhang> mrdk, thats enough
[16:46] <mrdk> Seveas-train: I guess that'll work, that might be the correct way to do it
[16:46] <sipior> mrdk: classy. you didn't actually understand your question, did you?
[16:46] <milko> ubottu, abhijeet ^
[16:46] <misha> yashi: Nope, a "normal" computer. I suspect the fancy Nvidia-graphics-card...
[16:46] <mrdk> bazhang: no you DIDN'T
[16:46] <Vigo_> misha: Have you tried ifup and ifdown
[16:47] <Seveas-train> bazhang, could you be a dear and remove the nuisance?
[16:47] <typhon_> Just wondering has anybody tried installing the latest distro onto a dell 745?
[16:47] <sipior> bazhang, could you do the honours?
[16:47] <misha> vigo: No, what does those tool do?
[16:47] <Vigo_> misha: They are just network resets, one moment,,,,
[16:47] <Seveas-train> ahh, ikonia stole it
[16:48] <yanick_> hi, process-monitor does not show the "real" memory usage; in the resources tab, I see that there is 3.7GB of RAM used, +759MB SWAP, but the processes tab shows that the biggest process (Chrome) uses not even 800MB, and all other are less than 200MB. .... I'm confused
[16:48] <Nikie> Hi there, help on wireless network problem...any experts ??
[16:48] <bazhang> Nikie, give us a lot more details
[16:48] <Seveas-train> yanick_, how much ram is used as filecache?
[16:48] <yanick_> it doesn't add up
[16:48] <Seveas-train> yanick_, what is the output of 'free -m'
[16:48] <misha> vigo: OK. Well, the system hangs *completely*. Keyboard/mouse doesn't react, and so on
[16:48] <Vigo_> misha: here is one page on it:> http://www.ubuntu.com/search/google-appliance/ifup
[16:48] <milko> ubottu, abhijeet: with gparted I got "unallocated"
[16:48] <ubottu> Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[16:48] <Nikie> bazhang - Initially when i installed ubuntu 10.04 on virtual Machine, it was able to detect the wireless network and got connected to it automatically...However, when i've installed ubuntu as a dual OS, it has detected the wireless network but is not getting connected.
[16:48] <yanick_> Seveas-train, hold on... severe system lag :(
[16:49] <OpenSourceCode> Does anyone know good font to use on ubuntu 10.04 Ambiance?
[16:49] <misha> vigo: Thx, I'll have a peek. But, as I said, it seems to be more than a network error.
[16:49] <typhon_> Has anybody tried installing the latest Distro on a Dell 745? When I try it gives me a black screen but I can install the netbook edition....
[16:49] <navneeth> could I get some help on compiz, please? I have the group and tab windows plugin enabled, but the thing doesn't work when I select windows
[16:49] <yanick_> Seveas-train, it shows 3060 total, 3923 used, 37 free, 0 shared, 10 buffers, 136 cached
[16:50] <bazhang> Nikie, lspci  to paste.ubuntu.com please; also the output of ifconfig , then give us the URL; dont paste into channel but to that website
[16:50] <bazhang> navneeth, try #compiz
[16:50] <undecim> What command would I use to mount a thumb drive without root privs?
[16:50] <Seveas-train> yanick_, pastebin full output please
[16:50] <Vigo_> misha: That page also covers that, the ifup/down are system calls, they also may assist in locating the error or dropped packets.
[16:50] <undecim> As if I had clicked on the drive from a file manager?
[16:50] <navneeth> bazhang, that place is quieter than a graveyard
[16:50] <bazhang> navneeth, then be patient
[16:50] <xangua> navneeth: then read the compiz wiki
[16:51] <yanick_> Seveas-train, http://pastie.org/1097931
[16:52] <navneeth> xangua, did that too... the instructions are pretty clear, and I have used this feature before... but for some reason, in a new installation where plugins-extra was not installed until an hour ago this feature is not working
[16:52] <Seveas-train> yanick_, of your 3.9gb used, 3.7 is used by the os to cache files. This is good.
[16:52] <OpenSourceCode> Anyone know good wallpaper for Ambiance theme?
[16:52] <misha> vigo: Mmm...ok...I'll have a look. Should an error situation result in some log entries?
[16:52] <undecim> What command does Nautilus use to mount drives without root privs?
[16:53] <dmaxx> do someone know a better software then testdisk 2 use 2 recover a formatted/wiped HDD??
[16:53] <Nikie> bazhang - http://paste.ubuntu.com/479464/
[16:53] <Vigo_> misha: That is the next step to look into, yes.
[16:53] <yanick_> Seveas-train, oh yeah? my system is lagging as hell as soon as my hd starts spinning and writing like crazy for 30 seconds every 5 min and the mouse stops moving, etc.
[16:53] <yanick_> this is GOOD?
[16:53] <Seveas-train> yanick_, the moment an application needs the memory, those files are removed from the cache.
[16:53] <Seveas-train> yanick_, this is not the reason of your disk spinning like hell. That is something else
[16:53] <misha> Which logfile would be closest? As I said, syslog just ends without any mention of any problems...
[16:53] <yanick_> Seveas-train, the biggest app open are Chrome and Netbeans... how can they use 4GB of RAM??
[16:53] <remote> dmaxx, a magnifying glass
[16:54] <bazhang> Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 5100 AGN Nikie and ifconfig shows wlan0
[16:54] <dmaxx> remote????? whoot??
[16:54] <Seveas-train> yanick_, they are not. Most of your memory is actually unused, so linux uses it to cache recently used files this makes your system considerably faster. Try to find out what is running during your periods of lag and what it is doing.
[16:54] <bazhang> Nikie, you have an unencrypted wifi spot to test on?
[16:54] <dmaxx> is that really a software??? >_<
[16:54] <yanick_> Seveas-train, the system is fine until it goes in screen saver mode (screen locked), then everything starts to get sticky, slow and laggish
[16:54] <remote> dmaxx, i admire your originality
[16:54] <Vigo_> misha: Network Interfaces, should be
[16:55] <dmaxx> :-p
[16:55] <Seveas-train> yanick_, that looks more like you have enabled opengl screensavers while using an intel or old videocard
[16:55] <misha> vigo: I had a quick peek at ifup/dn but can't immediately figure out how they would detect a complete system crash...
[16:55] <yanick_> Seveas-train, my video card is an ATI Radeo HD 3670
[16:55] <Friar> Is it possible to delete your swap partition and add it to your main one? I have 4GB of RAM and haven't used swap in a LONG time. I don't think so anyways. I long ago set my swapiness to 0.
[16:56] <cole_> hello
[16:56] <Seveas-train> yanick_, or some screensaver that insists on loading gigs of photos
[16:56] <yanick_> Seveas-train, my system is a Dell Studio XPS 16 , so I'd say pretty recent hardware, there shouldn't be any lag....
[16:56] <cole_> how to set the login windows backgroud in ubuntu 10.04
[16:56] <Nikie> bazhang - No :(
[16:57] <Vigo_> misha: I only suggested those as an alternative to a system boot, and those sys calls may help find the error.
[16:57] <yanick_> Seveas-train, yeah... that should be more like it, even though all I see for pictures are the gnome color test one all the time :/
[16:57] <OpenSourceCode> how can I reduce resolution of wallpaper from 1920x1600 to 1024x768 without losing picture capacity
[16:57] <yanick_> are = is
[16:57] <Seveas-train> yanick_, just use 'blank screen' as screensaver. You're not looking at it anyway :)
[16:57] <candrea> Friar: I would not recommend removing the swap partition (although is possible). Are you having problems of space on the disk?
[16:57] <cole_> anyone can help me ?
[16:57] <misha> vigo: OK. Well, the problem is that I can't do *anything* with the computer. The mouse and keyboard is dead, it just lacks responding :(
[16:58] <xangua> OpenSourceCode:  use gimp
[16:58] <ojii> hi everyone
[16:58] <Seveas-train> cole_, install gdm2setup
[16:58] <undecim> What command replaces devkit-disks in 10.04?
[16:58] <cole_> thank you
=== _NG is now known as _ng
[16:58] <Nikie> bazhang - but, i can change the settings so that any user can access without having to enter the password ? Is that ok ?
[16:58] <ojii> I know ubuntu has the UbuntuOne store but it really doesn't have any artists I like in it. I'd love to actually buy music but I can't see how I can do this on linux. Is there any way I can buy itunes music on linux/ubuntu?
[16:58] <Friar> candrea, I have a 30GB SSD, so I'm kind of tight....also, I don't know if I have anything in a recycle bin. My wife kept putting pictures on the SSD when I told her to used the external HDD for that becasue we simply do not have the storage space. We take a lot of pictures.
[16:58] <abhijit> cole_, https://launchpad.net/gdm2setup
[16:58] <cole_> oh no,my version is 10.04
[16:59] <yanick_> Seveas-train, aawww... but they are nice looking and makes Ubuntu look cool :P yeah. I'll try to use the blank screen only and see if the problem persists. However, I think it is a -1 for Ubuntu; the fact that it get's laggy with OpenGL screensavers...
[16:59] <bazhang> Nikie, that is what unencrypted means
[16:59] <cole_> there is no gdm2setup
[16:59] <abhijit> cole_, i gave you the link
[16:59] <Seveas-train> yanick_, did you install the closed source driver for your ati card?
[16:59] <bazhang> ojii, check the appdb and join #winehq
[16:59] <yanick_> Seveas-train, yes
[16:59] <bazhang> !appdb | ojii
[16:59] <ubottu> ojii: The Wine Application DB is a database of applications and help for !Windows programs that run under !WINE: http://appdb.winehq.org - Join #winehq for application help
[17:00] <yanick_> Seveas-train, I activated the thrid party repos and insalled it
[17:00] <ojii> bazhang, I'm aware of wine, but that's not what I call a solution
[17:00] <Seveas-train> yanick_, err, it's not in a 3rd party repo...
[17:00] <yanick_> Seveas-train, or do you mean did I download it from the ATI site ?
[17:00] <bazhang> Nikie, once that is done, then sudo dhclient wlan0 to test
[17:00] <Seveas-train> yanick_, no, from the 'restricted' repo
[17:00] <MACscr> Do you foresee issues with using debs in lucid, but werent created for karmic? Was going to use this ppa for the dcc-client, etc. http://ppa.launchpad.net/jonasped/ppa/ubuntu/pool/main/d/dcc/
[17:01] <yanick_> Seveas-train, then yes, sorry I meant restricted
[17:01] <bazhang> ojii, that or use virtualbox with windows, there is not a linux version of iTunes, nor will there ever be
[17:01] <CopyWriter> hello all
[17:01] <Nikie> ya..i understood...:) I'll do it..
[17:01] <abhijit> hi
[17:01] <Seveas-train> hi
[17:01] <candrea> Friar: to remove the swap you'll have to both delete the partition and remove the reference from /etc/fstab
[17:01] <Nikie> n ping u back...
[17:01] <CopyWriter> quick question does anybody else find 8.04.4 more stable than 10.04
[17:01] <ojii> bazhang, :(
[17:01] <abhijit> 8.04? :-o   nooooo
[17:02] <bazhang> MACscr, could work, but completely at your own risk and unsupported when/if it breaks
[17:02] <CopyWriter> why i'm asking is i'm thinking of going back
[17:02] <CopyWriter> to 8.04.4
[17:02] <Friar> candrea, will deleting the partition allow me to have the extra 2GB of space?
[17:02] <iceroot> CopyWriter: 8.04 is more tested and fixed then 10.04 because its older and still supported
[17:02] <CopyWriter> or should i just stick to 10.04
[17:02] <histo_> CopyWriter: 8.04.4 will have more testing and bug sqaushing done.
[17:02] <candrea> Friar: yes, but first you'll have to resize your "main" partition too
[17:02] <ajsie> could someone explain what RSA keypair is all about?
=== histo_ is now known as histo
[17:02] <yanick_> ajsie, Google RSA
[17:03] <Friar> I see...so I have to unmount swap before I can do it...candrea.
[17:03] <candrea> Friar: you can also resize your swap to e.g. 500 MB
[17:03] <abhijit> !google | yacc
[17:03] <ubottu> yacc: While Google is useful for helpers, many newer users don't have the google-fu yet. Please don't tell people to "google it" when they ask a question.
[17:03] <CopyWriter> i love the 10.04 lts release but it's a paiin to configure my wireless drivers
[17:03] <abhijit> yanick_, that was for you ^^^^
[17:03] <Seveas-train> ajsie, or look on wikipedia for "public key cryptography"
[17:03] <CopyWriter> propriety hardware driver doesn't detect it
[17:03] <yanick_> abhijit, good to know
[17:03] <candrea> Friar: to modify partitions you'll have to use a live cd
[17:03] <aj00200> ajsie: its a form of asymetric key encryption. Its a rather indepth topic, so you should google it.
[17:03] <CopyWriter> but in your opinions guys which would you choose the 8.04 lts or 10.03
[17:03] <CopyWriter> i mean 10.04
[17:03] <Friar> Candrea. Thanks for the help. I'm not sure I want to risk it at the moment. I have heard that people can sometimes have problems changing partitions...like losing everything.
[17:04] <histo> !poll | CopyWriter
[17:04] <ubottu> CopyWriter: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[17:04] <bazhang> CopyWriter, dont poll here
[17:04] <CopyWriter> sorry about that guys
[17:04] <Vigo_> ajsle: They are for Authentication
[17:04] <CopyWriter> did it without even realizing
=== _ng is now known as _NG
[17:04] <MACscr> bazhang: think it might be better just to get the packages from the developers and compile it?
[17:04] <CopyWriter> didn't mean to offend anyone
[17:05] <bazhang> MACscr, certainly safer
[17:05] <aeon-ltd> CopyWriter: whats the point of asking?, neither maintain your own ubuntu :)
[17:05] <candrea> Friar: to try to save more disk space have you tried using the Disk Usage Analyzer?
[17:05] <yanick_> ajsie, basically, RSA is an encryption algorithm that uses a private key to encrypt data and use a public key to be able to decrypt it
[17:05]  * CopyWriter scratches his head, trying to figure out how to ask bestbot
[17:05] <Friar> candrea, I have not. what is that/
[17:05] <ajsie> yanick_: i think u got it wrong
[17:06] <ajsie> yanick_: public key to encrypt and private to decrypt
=== LouisJB_ is now known as LouisJB
[17:06] <Intnz> mouse and keyboard hangs during installation of ubuntu 10.04 .what to do ?
[17:06] <candrea> Friar: it's a tool that you can access from Applications→Accessories
[17:06] <yanick_> ajsie, something like that
[17:06] <ajsie> read it in wiki =)
[17:06] <lukaszg> Hi! Can I install Ubuntu 32bit on the notebook with the i3-330M processor ( http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=47663 ) ?
[17:06] <CopyWriter> yes figured iti out
[17:06] <Seveas-train> Intnz, use a different keyboard :)
[17:06] <ajsie> yanick_: ive got 2 files: id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
[17:06] <misha> Does anyone here have any experience with the nvidia-drivers. I'm suspecting those for causing my system to hang...
[17:06] <bazhang> lukaszg, sure
[17:06] <ajsie> so the first one is private and the second one is public?
[17:06] <Intnz> seveas-train :and mouse?
[17:06] <yanick_> yes
[17:06] <candrea> Friar: if you have more users on your computer, tell it to scan the entire filesystem
[17:06] <hans_> ajsie: thats right
[17:06] <aj00200> !anyone | misha
[17:06] <ubottu> misha: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[17:06] <ajsie> hans_: okay
[17:06] <lukaszg> bazhang, thanks! :)
[17:06] <candrea> Friar: it will show you which files/folders occupy more space
[17:06] <iceroot> lukaszg: yes, also you can use the amd64 version
[17:07] <bazhang> lukaszg, how much ram
[17:07] <lukaszg> bazhang, 4GB

[17:08] <candrea> Friar: you can safely remove old kernels (if you are sure that the new one works OK), but it won't save much space
[17:08] <iceroot> lukaszg: amd64 has nothing to do with amd cpus, its also for intel cpus
[17:08] <Akashaa> hi, I've just upgraded from karmic to lucid lynx on an asus a6000KM laptop. I've managed to get the wifi up, and seemingly everything works fine. I just can't reboot if I stop the system.

[17:09] <tatofoo> hello, I want to find out an IP from a computer name, I've used nslookup but it's not working since my DNS server isn't telling me the IP, how else can I do it? or do I have to setup my own DNS somewhere?
[17:09] <Friar> candrea, I am pretty sure...I just updated to 2.6.33 for the TRIM support. I have a file that is 1GB called bootchart. It is in /var/log and it says there are 382 items in it....
[17:09] <milko> what means if when I run gparted I got the message "can't have overllaping partitions"?
[17:09] <gnomefreak> misha: nvidia-current: Installed: 195.36.24-0ubuntu1~10.04
[17:09] <acarr> normally, the ping command will resolve an ip address from a domain name.
[17:09] <Seveas-train> milko, that you're trying to make 2 partitions occupy the same space
[17:09] <acarr> tatofoo: fyi
[17:09] <Nazdravi> anyone have any experience with a good bluetooth manager for tethering to an iphone for kde 3.x?
[17:10] <aj00200> tatofoo: do you mean a domain name? Like get the ip for google.com?
[17:10] <misha> gnomefreak: Yeah, same as me :( I'm just fumbling around in the dark with this system of mine.
=== em is now known as emma
[17:10] <hans_> tatofoo: you can use ping
[17:10] <acarr> tatofoo:  normally, the ping command will resolve an ip address from a domain name.
[17:10] <tatofoo> if I do 'ping COMPUTER01' it's telling me 'ping: unknown host COMPUTER01'
[17:10] <lukaszg> bazhang, so, do you think that ubuntu 32bit will be works fine on it?
[17:10] <tatofoo> and we are on the same network
[17:11] <Friar> candrea, my disk usage also says that I only have 14GB on /. So I am clearly missing something...cause my df command gives this for sda: 25540128   2424776  92%
[17:11] <candrea> Friar: mh, bootchart file should be an image containing some information about the boot
[17:11] <sipior> tatofoo: is the name you are trying to resolve from one of your own domains?
[17:11] <bazhang> lukaszg, of course, just install the pae package I mentioned
[17:11] <milko> Seveas, my problem is when I want to install ubuntu
[17:11] <candrea> Friar: if you don't know what bootchart is, you can safely remove this file and the 'bootchart' package

[17:12] <lukaszg> bazhang, ok, thanks you very much
[17:12] <bazhang> lukaszg, welcome
[17:12] <tatofoo> sipior: yah, I looked up in /etc/resolv.conf and they both have the same domain
[17:12] <acarr> tatofoo:  If you are trying to ping a system on your own network with a computer name of "computer01" you will either need a hosts entry in your /etc/hosts file or the ip address / mac address to contact the device....
[17:12] <Nasder> New user, installing ubuntu on my notebook and I am unsure on how to partition it, 250gig. 2 gig swap, 40Mbyte boot, how big should I make root and home with the remaining 248ish Gigs?
[17:12] <Friar> candrea, I remember doing something about it when I first got my SSD to see the boot time. It seems like every boot has saved a file though.
[17:12] <candrea> Friar: can you please give me the usage of /, given by "df -h"?
[17:12] <milko> Sevas_afk, with the live cd the partitions are showed with nautilus
[17:13] <milko> but these are not recognized by the installer
[17:13] <bazhang> Nasder, boot should be a bit bigger, at least 100MB, although I use 250MB
[17:13] <spvensko> hello, stupid question but probably easy to answer - could i run a 64 bit ubuntu vm within a 32 bit ubuntu host OS?

[17:13] <tensorpudding> tatofoo: Try getting DynDNS.
[17:13] <tatofoo> acarr: MAC address :O! can I specify it in /etc/hosts instead of the IP?
[17:13] <Nasder> bazhang, I'll correct that then, should I split root and /home 50/50?
[17:14] <microsoft> how to check what wifi drivers are loaded to my system ?
[17:14] <bazhang> Nasder, 20-30GB for root, then the rest for a separate home partition
[17:14] <Friar> candrea, I may have just screwed things up....I did sudo apt-get remove bootchart....I dont know what my command line is doing now.
[17:14] <candrea> Friar: yes, for this reason bootchart eats a lot of space -- if you no longer need it remove both the packages and the files in /var/log/bootchart
[17:14] <_BEAST> microsoft: ?
[17:14] <bazhang> Nasder, way too large, even if you install the entire repo
[17:14] <tensorpudding> tatofoo: If they're behind a NAT, you'll need to setup port forwarding.

[17:15] <bazhang> microsoft, could you paste.ubuntu.com the output of lspci and ifconfig please?
[17:16] <acarr> tatofoo: also, is the machine on the same subnet as the machine you are trying to reach it from, or, do you have a static route setup if it is not?
[17:16] <tatofoo> acarr: yes, I use it already for wake on LAN, can I get the IP from it?
[17:16] <milko> I don't know why, but when I want to install ubuntu 10.4, the partitions are not recognized... but the partitiones are showed in nautillus
[17:16] <tmos> Hey guys, how do I find out the host address of my printer?
[17:16] <tatofoo> acarr: same subnet
[17:16] <Friar> candrea, too late....I removed the bootchart folder and contents and it used up the buffer on my terminal.
[17:16] <acarr> tatofoo: dhcp?
[17:16] <acarr> tatofoo: or static ips
[17:16] <Friar> candrea, well, here's to hoping that I can still boot next time I start my computer.
[17:16] <aj00200> tmos: is this a network printer?
[17:16] <tatofoo> acarr: dhcp, static is not an option
[17:16] <tmos> Yes aj
[17:17] <acarr> tatofoo: what is the ip of the machine you are on?
[17:17] <microsoft> i cant give u my ifconfig cuz there is to much private info
[17:17] <Nasder> So it's good when set as, 200Mbyte root, 2 Gbyte swap, 20Gig Root and the rest (225ish Gig) for /home
[17:17] <bazhang> microsoft, just tell me if it shows wlan0 or the like then
[17:17] <microsoft> <bazhang> yes it show wlan0
[17:17] <abhijit> milko, just try this it is not guranteed solution bu try it go to gparted from ubuntu livecd and make a partition blank on which you want to install ubuntu and then try installing it
[17:17] <aj00200> tmos: let me see if I can find how to do this. I did something similar recently
[17:17] <tatofoo> acarr: 10.0.18.82 and the other is 10.0.18.78

[17:18] <bazhang> vicpeng, this is Nasder ?
[17:19] <microsoft> <bazhang> but i can do for example modprobe rt2870sta and i know device rt2870 is no connected but the driver is loaded but how to check that this driver is loaded or get list of lodad drivers cuz for example why i type lsmod it show me connected devices and the drivers those devices use at the moment
[17:19] <Nasder> bazhang, I reckon he pinpointed it to you as I just threw it out there.
[17:19] <aj00200> tmos: Is this printer already setup for printer sharing with a windows network?
[17:19] <tatofoo> acarr: right now I know because I looked at it, but let's say, I shut them down and power them tomorrow (asumming there is not only one machine but 50 now) I won't know the IP of all of them, so that's why I was asking the NAME -> IP thing
[17:19] <bazhang> Nasder, okay you saw he said about the same then
[17:19] <microsoft> but that doesnt mean that this are all loaded drivers
[17:19] <microsoft> there maybe more loaded but not in use
[17:19] <tmos> Yes it is working with Windows 7 on my other box

[17:21] <aj00200> tmos: then you should eiter be able to get the hostname from there, or use the "Windows Printer via SAMBA" option in the printer setup page. You might need to install samba first "sudo apt-get install samba"

[17:31] <flixil> Hello, I just installed ubuntu and seems to freeze randomly. Even when not logging in and using a terminal (but with gdm running). I don't see grub at the beggining. Freezes really quick without giving time to do much. I got freezes on the installer as well, but in the end I was able to install ubuntu by trying several times. I use ubuntu gnome am64 the new stable one. Thanks
=== dennisdegreef is now known as DJF6
[17:31] <flixil> By terminal I mean tty1 or tty2 and so on...
[17:32] <oCean__> Nikie: I think bazhang is not online. What was your question? The output shows you got an ip address on your wireless interface..
[17:32] <toter> Does anyone have access to the font for Ubuntu's Logo? Any link to download? Geez... it's easier to compile the kernel than to have access to this font...
=== oCean__ is now known as oCean_
[17:32] <kmicinski> Hey all, when installing openoffice I keep getting an error of "short read in buffer_copy" in an OO debian package.
[17:32] <Nikie> ocean, oops ! thank you for the update, herez the recap...;)
[17:32] <Some_Person> toter: That's because there is no font. IIRC, it's just a custom logo
[17:33] <Nikie> ocean, Initially when i installed ubuntu 10.04 on virtual Machine, it was able to detect the wireless network and got connected to it automatically...However, when i've installed ubuntu as a dual OS, it has detected the wireless network but is not getting connected.
[17:33] <R\Peaceman> I've set up an samba share, and added a directory to share. The directory also includes 2 hard drives that is running on a another computer that I've mounted. The problem is that when I try to create a folder och upload a file from my computer, I get a message "no permissions" but when I am in putty and dir into the directory, I am allowed to create a folder and so on.
[17:33] <toter> Some_Person: http://design.canonical.com/2010/07/the-ubuntu-font/
[17:33] <toter> There is a font
[17:33] <toter> and it's new
[17:33] <toter> and it's impossible to get
[17:34] <oCean_> Nikie: but the dhclient command seems to have connected!
[17:34] <njain> flixil: you have sufficient hardware required by ubuntu version you are installing
[17:34] <econdudeawesome> Does anyone have a console music player besides music on console (MOC) they recommend? It appears the MOC for meerkat in lubuntu is broken.

[17:35] <iflema> econdudeawesome mplayer and mpg321 to name two....
[17:35] <econdudeawesome> xangua: package is "mpd" (is in apt-get install mpd?)
[17:35] <candrea> toter: the Ubuntu font is currently in beta, and only Ubuntu Members can access it, sorry
[17:35] <Nikie> ya..true..earlier when i was using encrypted connection, it was not getting connected...he asked me to use unencrypted connection..so, i had disabled the password encryption..n u can see the dhclient connected
[17:35] <oCean_> Nikie: ok, the output frm the dhclient command gave you an actual ip-address on wlan0. If you would do a 'ifconfig wlan0' at this point, it should show that there is an ipaddress. Can you connect to internet(sites) now?
[17:35] <econdudeawesome> xangua: iflema: do you recommend these over MOC in general also, or because my particular install is crapping out ;-) ?
[17:35] <R\Peaceman> I just dont get why I cant do it when i am using my own computer, literally speaking I am using the same user? because I log into the share with the ubuntu username and password?
[17:36] <Synthead> bobo123, aj00200: I understand that all our time here is a donation to the community, and I respect that, but I am an active supporter of the community too
[17:36] <Nikie> ya..without password encryption..
[17:36] <hiku> R\Peaceman: when you try to write over the samba mount, are you logging in? is it prompting you for username/password, or did you set the default permissions so that anyone can write to it?
[17:36] <toter> candrea: it's just a font... I don't understand the difficulty in trying to get it...
[17:36] <flixil> I don't have even time to install ssh-server or stop gdm using the console. Is there a way to start without X if there is no grub?
[17:36] <flixil> The system is a fresh instalation
[17:36] <iflema> econdudeawesome your install is not supported here ;)
[17:36] <sipior> toter: deal with it until it is publicly available.
[17:36] <xangua> econdudeawesome: well mpd has terminal and gui inferfaces
[17:36] <toter> nobody has a freaking website so I can download this font?
[17:36] <Some_Person> toter: Seems odd that they would release it as a closed beta. I thought ubuntu was all about open-ness
[17:36] <R\Peaceman> I've tried both, to mount a windows share and put in the login information and i've tried without logging in, nothing is working
[17:36] <Nikie> however, when i'm encrypting, I'm not able to connect..( to restrain others 2 us my network i protected with password)
[17:37] <oCean_> Nikie: indeed. What could help (not sure if you already tried) is go to menu System > Preferences > Network Connections and remove the current wireless setup and then add it again
[17:37] <xangua> toter: wait until maverick relelase
[17:37] <econdudeawesome> iflema: I know ;-) Just looking for some advice. MOC is the shiznick and I'm sad it bricked (as far as a program can brick)
[17:37] <toter> I am going to become a Ubuntu Member, download this font and provide everybody with a link

[17:37] <Nikie> oh ! okai...I've not tried it..
[17:38] <oCean_> toter: "becoming a member" is not something done very easily

[17:58] <Spaztic_One> But no, I don't know how to use tty
[17:58] <pierre_> any idea what to do?
[17:59] <pierre_> ubuntu 10.04 ....
[17:59] <candrea> Spaztic_One: no problem: if you use a terminal, you don't need a tty
[18:00] <amanita_> Spaztic_One: if you are in a terminal sudo apt-get install htop then run htop
[18:00] <guest__> need ?     hmmm      we don't need computers at all.
[18:00] <amanita_> spaztic_one: it will help you to kill processess.

[18:00] <pierre_> yeah
[18:00] <pierre_> regular movies works etc
[18:01] <pierre_> and drivers are installed for everything
[18:01] <reggi> just youtube in full screen doesn't work pierre_?
[18:01] <Spaztic_One> So, I need to get htop to be able to list running processes to kill them?
[18:01] <pierre_> ANY streamed video via browser
[18:01] <Cheery> how to set smbd workgroup?
[18:01] <pierre_> works on normal but not fullscreen
[18:01] <guest__> Spaztic_One no.    there are several ways to list processes
[18:01] <reggi> pierre_: is this a new installation of ubuntu?
[18:01] <candrea> Spaztic_One: not necessarily, you can also just use "killall teamviewer"
[18:02] <pierre_> reggi: didnt work on my old one either
[18:02] <pierre_> reggi: ive had the installation for 3-4 months tho
[18:02] <dewman> is anyone familier with how to configure amanda for 10.04?
[18:02] <reggi> pierre_: which browser are you using?
[18:02] <m4dv0y> hi there
[18:02] <pierre_> firefox
[18:02] <guest__> Spaztic_One if you know the name of an app you want to kill just run    killall <name>     or you can search for the name with things like "ps"  which is already installed
[18:02] <Spaztic_One> What is one that lists processes because it can't find a process called teamviewer
[18:03] <Spaztic_One> and ps only lists two items
[18:03] <reggi> pierre_: do you have chromium?
[18:03] <pierre_> nah getting it
[18:03] <pierre_> brb
[18:03] <guest__> Spaztic_One "ps ax"
[18:03] <reggi> pierre_: ok

[18:05] <guest__> Spaztic_One heh.  you can scroll up in the terminal too...
[18:05] <guampa> anyone using nx?
[18:05] <guest__> luist then find the package and go from there.

[18:05] <MiketheMagiCat> Hi.  Can someone help me? I had Ubuntu installed on my computer. I also have Windows Vista (which I hate). But today it would not let me go online. It said there was a broken link. I could not find it. I uninstalled it. I installed Download Ubuntu Desktop Edition 32 bit. And then it told me when it finished downloading to choose a program to open it up. I chose Internet Explorer. Now I can't find the
[18:05] <MiketheMagiCat> 	MiketheMagiCat	program anywhere on the computer, or in my files. I also tried loading it on to my usb flash drive, and it didn't work. Is there a phone number to call for support for Linux products. I am a beginner and an idiot.
[18:06] <maitrey> <maitrey> Hi,  I have formatted my usb and then there was the permissions problem. I have used the "chown" message in terminal, but now I can't copy anything on it from another computers. How shall I give the permissions to all the computer/users?
[18:06] <maitrey> <maitrey> <maitrey> thanks
[18:06] <candrea> Spaztic_One: once you have found the pid of the process (the number in the leftmost column), type "q" to exit from less
[18:06] <guest__> luist where... python.org ???   any .deb ok... no.  use one that is compatable with your other packages (python)
[18:08] <schorem> hi all
[18:08] <pgpkeys> I'm getting a bunch of errors   .: 5: Can't open /scripts/functions
[18:08] <Spaztic_One> candrea, can't scroll when the mouse doesn't work, or at least I don't know how to via the keyboard
[18:08] <pgpkeys> when update-grub is run from packages like linux-image
[18:08] <guest__> luist dpkg will warn you if there are dependancy issues.   and you can take action to correct that
[18:09] <candrea> Spaztic_One: if you're using less, just use the arrows of the keyboard
[18:09] <pgpkeys> i get the errors right after cryptsetup runs (even though I'm not using an encrypted config)
[18:09] <guest__> Spaztic_One page-up  button   or maybe   shift+page-up
[18:10] <yashi-> Spaztic_One: just put |less behind the command
[18:10] <guest__> s/button/key/
[18:10] <jacob_> Hey guys
[18:10] <pgpkeys> it looks like its occuring right after cryptsetup adds the information to the initrd image about the resume device candidate(s)
[18:10] <oCean_> Spaztic_One: or, just search for a pattern: ps axuw | grep team
[18:10] <Spaztic_One> I was talking about scrolling when not in |less
[18:10] <jacob_> anyone willing to help me with something?
[18:10] <guest__> Spaztic_One me too

[18:10] <oCean_> jacob_: just ask your question in the channel please
[18:11] <luist> guest__: python.org wont give me this package :P
[18:11] <Spaztic_One> but either way, pkill teamviewer and pkill <pid> didn't nuke the program
[18:11] <pgpkeys> damn. thought i'd disabled that trigger permenantly
[18:11] <candrea> Spaztic_One: use "kill -9 <pid>"
[18:11] <jacob_> My external hard drive will not connect to ubuntu, it is the only problem i seem to have, its a 500gb WD elements external HDD, any other USB devices and external hard drives seem to work except this one
[18:11] <oCean_> luist: why would you need it? Whoever told you you need it, can't they provide the package?
[18:12] <Spaztic_One> HUZZAH!
[18:12] <Spaztic_One> Thanks guys
[18:12] <yashi-> jacob_: what do you mean? auto mount doesnt work? or doesnt ubuntu detect it?
[18:12] <jacob_> ubuntu seems to detect it, the auto mount does not work

[18:13] <candrea> Spaztic_One: glad to know that your problem is solved :)
[18:13] <Spaztic_One> Yup
[18:13] <yashi-> jacob_: so you can mount it manually?
[18:13] <jacob_> i beleive i have been told to try this but it didnt work
[18:13] <jkiv> I tried installing something with dpkg and it failed... but when I use apt-get, it references the file I tried to dpkg and fails to do what I want it to do: "E: Couldn't find package openoffice.org3.2-debian-menus_3.2-9502_all.deb"
[18:13] <jacob_> i was on Linux forums, i can give you the link if you wish
[18:13] <rowan_> hi i need help
[18:14] <yashi-> jacob_: you can see all harddrives which ubuntu found via sudo fdisk -l
[18:14] <IdleOne> rowan_: ask and someone will help if they can
[18:14] <Spaztic_One> In retrospect, it probably would have been easier to simply ask how to locate/identify and kill a program using the terminal only. I was about 99% sure that it was teamviewer that was causing the problem
[18:15] <yashi-> jacob_: then try sudo mount /dev/harddrive name(something like sdc1) /add the folder where you want to mount it
[18:15] <xangua> jkiv: not a good idea install packages from other distros
=== dgtl|screen is now known as dgtlchlk
[18:15] <jacob_> Okay i will try this and report back
[18:15] <guest__> who broke eject ?    it doesn't work when things are mounted other than /media   ???
[18:16] <jkiv> xangua, trying to do http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1404156 on 9.04.  Last step failed.  Trying to back out.
[18:16] <scampbell> guest__: it won't eject if the mount is in use, it works fine for me from manual mount points though.
[18:17] <rowan_> i have a network drive being shared by windows network and today when i sign in i get some thing on my desktop called "drive letter"onmedion.volume and in my places it is called x-nautilus-desktop: f on medion.volume however when i go to open this network drive it opens up alot of windows with the folder manager but you can stop them with xkill. Eventually they go but i cant view any of my files or places
=== wazzup is now known as wiiguy
[18:17] <yashi-> guest__: use umount instead of eject :/
[18:17] <rowan_> but you can't stop them*
[18:17] <jacob_> so i should do something like this?
[18:17] <jacob_> jacob@jacob-laptop:~$ sudo mount /dev/sda3/media
[18:17] <guest__> scampbell hmmm   i have to use umount because eject complains about blah not being under /media   ;/
[18:18] <xangua> jkiv: just extract the deb and install it, make sure to first remove openoffice from repository
[18:18] <djbeenie_> im getting fed up with the sound on my ubuntu, it works some days and somedays it does not
[18:18] <guest__> yashi- pfft    yeah   umount and then manually open the tray
[18:18] <uberj> djbeenie_: the more you use it the easeir it becomes
[18:18] <rowan_> i have a network drive being shared by windows network and today when i sign in i get some thing on my desktop called "drive letter"onmedion.volume and in my places it is called x-nautilus-desktop: f on medion.volume however when i go to open this network drive it opens up alot of windows with the folder manager but you can't stop them with xkill. Eventually they go but i cant view any of my files or places
[18:18] <djbeenie_> lol
[18:19] <rowan_> apparently this bug was meant to be solved by the latest update
[18:19] <yanick_> Seveas-train, ...hmm... if my memory is mostly free, then I would like to know why I just watched my hd scratch for over 2 min straight after I switched from Netbeans to Chrome ?
[18:19] <rowan_> i checked and i have them all
[18:19] <scampbell> guest__: Hmm, I just mounted a dvd to /mnt and ejected it. guess I'm of no use :(
[18:20] <rowan_> any ideas guys?
[18:20] <jkiv> xangua, doing so failed.  I'm trying to revert.  apt-get, for some reason, wants the location of the failed .deb.
[18:20] <jimbo> I wish to make an empty .deb package that simply brings in other packages as dependencies.  Is there a name for this so I can learn how?
[18:20] <yanick_> I have a core 2 duo with 4GB of RAM, Netbeans ans Chrome is open, but yet simply opening a terminal takes 30 seconds.
[18:20] <yashi-> jacob_: are you sure it is sda3? sda is the name of the hard drive the numbers behind it represend the single partitions...im just wondering because sda is my primary device (internal)
[18:21] <djbeenie_> is there a way to re-start alsa, this was easy to do in gentoo.  /etc/init.d/alsa restart
[18:21] <rowan_> i have a network drive being shared by windows network and today when i sign in i get some thing on my desktop called "drive letter"onmedion.volume and in my places it is called x-nautilus-desktop: f on medion.volume however when i go to open this network drive it opens up alot of windows with the folder manager but you can't stop them with xkill. Eventually they go but i cant view any of my files or places
[18:21] <yanick_> top is not reporting the same thing as system-monitor
[18:21] <jacob_> it might be just sdb
[18:21] <guest__> yashi- yeah  sda is usually the boot device
[18:22] <yashi-> jacob_: type sudo fdisk -l it lists all devices you have
[18:22] <jacob_> Yeah it must be /dev/sdb because its the only 500gb there
[18:23] <guest__> there ya go
[18:23] <yashi-> jacob_: ok now you have to mount the device for example sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1
[18:23] <pierre_> reggi: tried with chrome, didnt work i still get the video on my laptop instead of the TV
[18:23] <yashi-> there has to be a folder in media called sdb1
[18:24] <pierre_> reggi: even tho i have the browser on the TV screen not the laptop
[18:24] <guest__> sdb if it's not partitioned
[18:24] <jacob_> its not partitioned
[18:24] <djbeenie_> anyone know how to restart alsa?
[18:24] <yashi-> jacob_: you should do that before mounting it
[18:24] <jkiv> xanga, got it. I was in the dir with the .deb... Doing a wildcard openoffice* had it thinking it was a file satisfying the wildcard.
[18:25] <guest__> yashi- do what before mounting it ???
[18:25] <jacob_> Why? and this is what i get, : jacob@jacob-laptop:~$ sudo mount /dev/sdb/media/sdb        mount: can't find /dev/sdb/media/sdb in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
[18:26] <rowan_> Help Me Please
[18:26] <rowan_> i have a network drive being shared by windows network and today when i sign in i get some thing on my desktop called "drive letter"onmedion.volume and in my places it is called x-nautilus-desktop: f on medion.volume however when i go to open this network drive it opens up alot of windows with the folder manager but you can't stop them with xkill. Eventually they go but i cant view any of my files or places
[18:26] <Typh> Is there any way to fix the bug where clicks constantly go "through" the title bar you're clicking on?
[18:26] <guest__> heh jacob_ missing a space between device and mountpoint
[18:26] <yashi-> jacob_: you have to put a blank between the /dev/sdb<->and the mount folder
[18:26] <jimbo> jacob_: /dev/sdb is the device.  /dev/sdb1 is the first partition on the device.  You only mount partititions.
[18:26] <guest__> jimbo no   wrong.  you only mount file systems.   you don't mount partitions
[18:27] <RainRain> what do people do for scheduled backups on ubuntu - have been using the very powerful cobian on windows for the last year but i cant seem to find anything like it on windows ( GUI and scheduled and network backups ) .. thanks
[18:27] <jimbo> Also guys I don't think it's beneficial to name mountpoints after partition names.  They can change, and then things get very confusing.
[18:27] <jimbo> guest__: fair enough
[18:27] <jimbo> but filesystems exist on partitions
[18:27] <guest__> jimbo you can have a file system without a partition
[18:27] <rowan_> i have a network drive being shared by windows network and today when i sign in i get some thing on my desktop called "drive letter"onmedion.volume and in my places it is called x-nautilus-desktop: f on medion.volume however when i go to open this network drive it opens up alot of windows with the folder manager but you can't stop them with xkill.

[19:10] <DarkSector> trism, considering even the installed one has variant
[19:10] <yashi-> jacob: you should try search for cant mount ntfs partition or something like that. im sure you will find a solution this way
[19:10] <trism> DarkSector: update manager should tell you if you click on it, in the description (version something -> something else)
[19:10] <Slart> Kjeldor: huh?
[19:10] <Kjeldor> Slart: other than BASH..?
[19:10] <DarkSector> trism, ah ok, lemme check

Just wondering if there is a tcpip problem, would the installer just timeout and go to the next file, or prompt with some error

[19:35] <wng-> what is the fastest way to clone linux systems? I have 1 system i need to clone into 95 machines
[19:35] <charmer> hello all
[19:35] <Oer> !clone
[19:35] <ubottu> To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type « aptitude  --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/my-packages », move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type « sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install » - See also !automate
[19:35] <wng-> no, i mean clone hard drives, not package selection
[19:36] <cdm10> wng-: http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cimages/cheader01.jpg
[19:36] <bzrk> wng-: dd
[19:36] <Oer> wng-, use dd ?
[19:36] <wng-> i figured dd would be slow
[19:36] <cdm10> wng-: but in more seriousness, there's dd, which can be kinda slow and ugly, but there's also partimage, which only copies the used parts of the drive.
[19:36] <bzrk> wng-: its not
[19:36] <bzrk> wng-: you can fiddle with the blocksizes and it will really go fast then
[19:37] <aeon-ltd> wng-: clonezilla?
[19:37] <abhijit> bye
[19:37] <cdm10> wng-: partimage is filesystem-aware, as is, I believe, Clonezilla, so it'll only copy used blocks of the drive, rather than all the zeroes or randomness that fills the rest of the drive.
[19:38] <medfly> :((
[19:38] <bzrk> wng-: with 95 machines its probably worth looking into something more elaborate and powerful, like fai or preseeding or puppet
[19:38] <medfly> oh man, in trying to fix something myself, I think I've created a bigger problem :)
