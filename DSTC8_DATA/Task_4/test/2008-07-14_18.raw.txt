[15:40] <ohyouknow1987> shujah: what is medibuntu?
[15:40] <ubuntu-baby> ﻿Shujah_: Desktop effects couldn't be enabled -- it says
[15:40] <sHOCkwAV1> I'm new to linux. Is there a way to check if my ndiswrapper is ok?
[15:40] <Slart> !medibuntu | ohyouknow1987
[15:40] <ubottu> ohyouknow1987: medibuntu is a repository of packages that cannot be included into the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons - See http://www.medibuntu.org
[15:40] <ubuntu-baby> Rambo3 - what 'other' driver should i use?
[15:40] <jimmy51> ikonia, ok, thanks.  i've TFTP'd into localhost, but i can't get or put anything
=== DarkAudi1 is now known as DarkAudit
[15:40] <ikonia> jimmy51: so thats normally a permissions error
[15:40] <Dante123> ﻿Slart I get google to send me any news on ubuntu or linux....and it was in a link from their digest that I read about this client.  But none that you mention ring a bell.  I know it worked with a wide variety of webcams and was strictly video no texting
[15:41] <cih997> hi, i'm using ubuntu studio 8.04, audacious 1.5.0, when song is over next not playing only stay in 00:00. Option ctrl+M (stop after current) is off. :/
[15:41] <Slart> Dante123: sounds nice..let me know if you remember the name
[15:41] <jimmy51> ikonia: do i need to make the tftp root more accessible?
[15:41] <sdakak> Does ubuntu have a problem with me deleting the last gnome-panel?
[15:41] <sdakak> I mean how can I have a completely panel-less desktop?
[15:41] <Shujah_> ubuntu-baby, download nvidia via envyng - once downloaded - download nvidia-settings , config your display from nvidia-settings and save to x-configuration file, dont merge save
[15:41] <ikonia> jimmy51: certainly looks that way
[15:42] <Sivam> hi all
[15:42] <rambo3> ubuntu-baby, i don't know was it nvidia-glx
[15:42] <jimmy51> ikonia: ok, can you walk me through that?  i guess read only would be ok, since it's just supposed to serve up pxe images
[15:42] <KMR01> well, ndiswrapper for me was a bit shaky on two of my wireless cards.
[15:42] <sdakak> I got disconnected.
[15:42] <ikonia> jimmy51: as long as it's world readable
[15:42] <lesshaste_> is there a way to downgrade from backported versions to the normal stable versions?
[15:42] <ubuntu-baby> rambo 3 - I tried Nvidia-glx Nvidia-glx-new and the other one....all 3
[15:42] <Gnea> lesshaste_: yes.
[15:42] <topsub> only thing i had to do after i used this.. https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html.. was turn down my hue and it worked perfect
[15:43] <sdakak> lesshaste Turn off the backports in synaptic and say reload, upgrade all?
[15:43] <lesshaste_> Gnea, how do you do that?
[15:43] <lesshaste_> Gnea, I'd like to do it for all packages
[15:43] <Gnea> lesshaste_: try sdakak's suggestion
[15:43] <sdakak> Can anyone tell me how to have a completely panel-less desktop?
[15:43] <jimmy51> ikonia, i think the tftproot is /var/lib/tftpboot/
[15:43] <ikonia> jimmy51: go for it
[15:43] <Gnea> lesshaste_: if not, you may need to uninstall the packages by hand, then reinstall them.
[15:43] <lesshaste_> sdakak, it says nothing to upgrade
[15:44] <ohyouknow1987> i cant get to medibuntu it says server not found
[15:44] <lesshaste_> sdakak, how do I tell which installed packages come from backports? Maybe that would be easier
[15:44] <Gnea> !medibuntu
[15:44] <ubottu> medibuntu is a repository of packages that cannot be included into the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons - See http://www.medibuntu.org
[15:44] <Sivam> hi
[15:44] <decline> Slart, works perfect in WinXP...
[15:44] <jimmy51> ikonia: chmod  ??  /var/lib/tftpboot
[15:44] <sdakak> lesshaste_: ikonia would provide you better help.
[15:44] <Dante123> TokBox is the app name Slart
[15:44] <Gnea> lesshaste_: what's wrong with the backports?
[15:44] <ikonia> jimmy51: 775 ?
[15:44] <sdakak> jimmy51: Are you trying to net boot?
[15:44] <Dante123> here is the review
[15:44] <ikonia> jimmy51: -R
[15:44] <ikonia> jimmy51: chmod -R
[15:44] <sdakak> Gnea: There is a reason they are called so :)
[15:44] <jimmy51> ok
[15:45] <Dante123> http://community.zdnet.co.uk/blog/0,1000000567,10008650o-2000498448b,00.htm?new_comment Check it out Slart
[15:45] <ikonia> sdakak: huh, what's up ?
[15:45] <ohyouknow1987> anyone else have ideas for playing dvds?
[15:45] <lesshaste_> sdakak, ikonia?
[15:45] <Gnea> sdakak: and there is a reason why they don't bother me :)
[15:45] <lesshaste_> hi ikonia
[15:45] <ikonia> hello
[15:45] <Slart> decline: bah.. now I don't know what to expect any more.. are they blocking connection attempts from linux computers? =)
[15:45] <Shujah_> ohyouknow1987, download vlc
[15:45] <Slart> Dante123: thanks.. looking at it now
[15:45] <lesshaste_> ikonia, I am trying to restabilise my setup by getting rid of any backports
[15:45] <Gnea> ohyouknow1987: i already gave you a link to help you out.
[15:45] <ikonia> lesshaste_: ok
[15:45] <lesshaste_> ikonia, do you know how to list all the installed backport packages for example?
[15:46] <ikonia> lesshaste_: one moment, I don't think you can do it by repo
[15:46] <lesshaste_> ikonia, ok
[15:46] <sdakak> ikonia: Hey. He wants downgrade his backports
[15:46] <jimmy51> ikonia, ah, i see.  the 775 is the permission mode and the -R makes it recursive
[15:46] <decline> Slart, yea hehe this is mysterious. First of all, how could it just suddenly start demanding the DNS ip's to work, and why is everything else than MSN working when I got the DNS ip's :|
[15:46] <mrtimdog> Hi, any reason synaptic marks for update packages which have been pinned to a particular version?
[15:46] <ikonia> lesshaste_: I see
[15:46] <ikonia> jimmy51: you got it
[15:46] <Gnea> lesshaste_: this is a bit of a longshot, but: dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep bpo   you might get mixed results.
[15:46] <ikonia> jimmy51: you want it to be able to see the images too, not just the dir, hence the -R
[15:46] <Slart> decline: I have no idea.. it's very weird
[15:47] <Joeseph> I've recently wiped my old computer and gave it away, and the other hard drive on it I did not wipe had ubuntu on it.  If I just put the hard drive into my new computer, would it work?
[15:47] <Shujah_> tried amsn?
[15:47] <lesshaste_> Gnea, hard to tell if that worked or not
[15:47] <lesshaste_> ikonia, any help much appreciated
[15:47] <Shujah_> Joeseph, you might have to edit grub
[15:47] <Gnea> lesshaste_: that just tives you a list. try pastebining it
[15:47] <Gnea> !pastebin | lesshaste_
[15:47] <ubottu> lesshaste_: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu.com (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[15:48] <Slart> Dante123: bah.. silly flash app doesn't work with my ff3 =/
[15:48] <ikonia> lesshaste_: I can't see anything within the dpkg man page that suggests it can read the repo's the package came from
[15:48] <Joeseph> Shujah_: but It might work? is the only way to try?
[15:48] <lesshaste_> Gnea, http://paste.ubuntu.com/27293/
[15:48] <Dante123> okay Slart.  I forgot it was flash based
[15:48] <lesshaste_> ikonia, ok so any tips on how to remove all backports?
[15:48] <ikonia> lesshaste_: I'm wondering if you delselect proposed which should update apt-cache policy, and do an apt-get update will it prompt you for the downgrade
[15:49] <ikonia> lesshaste_: s/proposed/backports
[15:49] <lesshaste_> ikonia, it didn't sadly
[15:49] <ross> i'm having some problems installing virtual box
[15:49] <Shujah_> Joeseph, if the grub address fro hd doesnt change e.g. it was hd0 and its hd0 now then it'll boot - so you might try to boot you'll know
[15:49] <ikonia> lesshaste_: give me a few minutes,
[15:49] <lesshaste_> ikonia, unless there just weren't any.. but I suspect it only goes up that way
[15:49] <lesshaste_> ikonia, ok
[15:49] <ross> here is the error message: VirtualBox kernel driver not installed. The vboxdrv kernel module was either not loaded or /dev/vboxdrv was not created for some reason. Please install the virtualbox-ose-modules package for your kernel, e.g. virtualbox-ose-modules-generic..
[15:49] <sdakak> How do I get the pidgin avant plugin to work?
[15:49] <ross> can anyone help please
[15:49] <Gnea> lesshaste_: sorry, i'm not sure :(
[15:50] <lesshaste_> Gnea, ok
[15:50] <lesshaste_> thanks anyway
[15:50] <Gnea> ross: it told you what to do
[15:50] <sdakak> ross: Are you using the os version? Why not head over to their site and grab the binary package. It builds the kernel module automatically and provides usb support.
[15:50] <Gnea> lesshaste_: good luck
[15:50] <lesshaste_> basically my sound has died so how about just reinstalling everything sound related
[15:50] <Jack_Sparrow> ross vbox has a channel.. but did you install it from our repos or go and try to get the latest and do it yourself
[15:50] <lesshaste_> is that possible?
[15:50] <lesshaste_> how do you reinstall packages?
[15:50] <sdakak> ross: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox
[15:50] <Joeseph> Shujah_: Alrighty, then I'll give it a try.   but, while I'm here....  I'd like to wipe my ubuntu install also and install UbuntuStudio. since I do not have a DVD player in my computer, I can't install it that way. Could I wipe and reinstall from the command line?
[15:51] <ross> errr
[15:51] <ikonia> lesshaste_: do you have synaptic ?
[15:51] <lesshaste_> ikonia, yes
[15:51] <lesshaste_> ikonia, but I mostly use the command line
[15:51] <ross> i installed it from the site
[15:51] <jimmy51> ikonia: ok, my permissions are read/write for root, but read only for all else.  i still can't get/put files.  either i don't have  the tftproot set to the correct folder, or something else is going on.
[15:51] <ikonia> jimmy51: one moment
[15:51] <Blade_Wizard_Fal> HELP!!! just did an update (system said there were updates available, went with it. Said it updated Firefox, and i needed to restart firefox, so i closed down the browser, and attempted to start it up. it gives me this "Failed to execute child process "firefox" (No such file or directory)" so i try in the terminal, and it tells me it isnt installed, so i do "sudo apt-get install firefox-3.0 (as it tells me too) and it returns: firefox-3.0 is already
[15:51] <Blade_Wizard_Fal> the newest version....what did i do?
[15:51] <Jack_Sparrow> !find vbox
[15:51] <ubottu> Found: isdnvbox, isdnvboxclient, isdnvboxserver, raccess4vbox3, vbox3
[15:52] <ross> after sudo modprobe vboxdrv, it says "FATAL: Module vboxdrv not found."
[15:52] <Shujah_> Joeseph, you mean wipe ubuntu then install ubuntu studio? how are you gonna mount the iso - you aint got the cd-rom?
[15:52] <ross> what to do what to do
[15:52] <ikonia> lesshaste_: if you search for ubp in synaptic it shows all the backport packages, which if you then mark for re-install it will re-install from main rather than backports
[15:52] <drago>  /j #perl.it
[15:52] <Gnea> ross: it tells you to install it from the repository, not from a website
[15:52] <prodigel> hi all. no connection to linux or ubuntu, but still: Does anyone know if I can use my phone to stream mp3 in fm so that my car radio can play whatever I want? :) I know there are such things to buy, still would be great to do it from my phone
[15:53] <ikonia> lesshaste_: got it, get the package "apt-show-versions"
[15:53] <ross> gnea: ok, i just searched for virtual box on the repos
[15:53] <ross> gnea: um
[15:53] <Joeseph> Shujah_: UbuntuStudio takes a DVD. I have the iso, but I can't use it cause I have no DVD player. I could take a dvd player form one of my other systems if I had to though.
[15:53] <ross> gnea: there are a lot of choices here
[15:53] <ikonia> lesshaste_: then do apt-show-versions -i; apt-show-versions -b | grep hardy-backports
[15:53] <Gnea> ross: and it still tells you the name of the package
[15:53] <ross> gnea: which modules should i install?
[15:53] <bartmon> Hey guys. I've added a new HDD into my machine and it is seen as /dev/sda so all my other devices got a new major device number. I have a modified fstab for mounting one partition and only this partition broke because i didn't use uuidgen. how can i get a uuid of a partition?
=== sbazemore is now known as sbazemore_
[15:54] <Gnea> ross: read what you stated
[15:54] <Jack_Sparrow> !uuid
[15:54] <ubottu> To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in a !shell: « sudo blkid » (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[15:54] <ikonia> bartmon: uuid
=== sbazemore_ is now known as sbazemore
[15:54] <ikonia> jimmy51: sorry, you where saying
[15:54] <ross> gnea: AHA
[15:54] <Gnea> .......Please install the virtualbox-ose-modules package for your kernel, e.g. virtualbox-ose-modules-generic.........
[15:54] <Shujah_> Joeseph, well yeah you can mount the dvd by acetonel (on still installed ubuntu) but I'm not sure if it'll work
[15:54] <jimmy51> ikonia,  permissions look correct (when viewed with thunar) but i still can't GET/PUT
[15:54] <bartmon> Jack_Sparrow, ikonia: excellent, thanks!
[15:54] <Jack_Sparrow> np
[15:55] <Joeseph> Shujah_: It might just be easier to get a dvd player....
=== sbazemore is now known as sbazemore_
[15:55] <ikonia> jimmy51: what does your tftp config show ?
[15:55] <Gnea> ross: cat /proc/version  will tell you what kernel you're using
[15:55] <Shujah_> Joeseph, it is, and much less likely to backfire
[15:55] <jimmy51> ikonia, that's in /etc/inetd.conf, right?
[15:55] <ikonia> jimmy51: don't know, is that where you set it up?
[15:55] <ross> gnea: ok, i'm using the 18-generic vesion
[15:55] <ikonia> jimmy51: hang on, I'll get it myself
[15:55] <Shujah_> Joeseph, though you might wanna check the md5 before going through all the hassle
[15:55] <Joeseph> Shujah_: alright, I'll probably try that... that way I don't even have to boot it.
[15:56] <Gnea> ross: then download the 18-generic package
[15:56] <Blade_Wizard_Fal> anyone?
[15:56] <lesshaste_> ikonia, thanks.. I feel we are very close... you didn't quite mean apt-show-versions -i; apt-show-versions -b | grep hardy-backports
[15:56] <lesshaste_> did you?
[15:56] <Joeseph> Shujah_: what is the md5... wait, I'll llook it up.
[15:56] <ross> gnea: only the 18-generic package?
[15:56] <jimmy51> ikonia: in my inetd.conf i have this:  tftp           dgram   udp     wait    root  /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /usr/sbin/in.tftpd -s /var/lib/tftpboot
[15:56] <lesshaste_> ikonia, that lists things like autoconf/hardy uptodate 2.61-4
[15:56] <ikonia> lesshaste_: still working it thorugh
[15:56] <ikonia> jimmy51: ok
[15:56] <m-c> Is there a command line interface to burning a cdrom?  Is it as simple as dd?
[15:57] <Gnea> ross: whatever works
[15:57] <Shujah_> Joeseph, md5 is a dvd/cd check to see if the data was corrupted during download -
[15:57] <ikonia> jimmy51: what version of ubuntu are you using ?
[15:57] <lesshaste_> ok
[15:57] <Gnea> m-c: yes. no.
[15:57] <jimmy51> ikonia: 8.04
[15:58] <Joeseph> Shujah_: oh....  Wiki told me it was a cryptographic algorithm that is now considered unsafe.... hahaha
[15:58] <ikonia> jimmy51: I've just pulled down tftpd and it setup the tftp root as /srv/tftp
[15:58] <Shujah_> md5 is unsafe :s
[15:58] <Gnea> hangnails are unsafe
[15:58] <m-c> Gnea: Ah.  So, what program provides the command line interface to burn a cdrom?
[15:58] <mic1394> is there an audio/video player that plays all formats and codecs in ubuntu such as vlc in windows?
[15:58] <jimmy51> ikonia, ok, maybe my config is bad.  i'll change the root to /srv/tftp
[15:58] <bartmon> I have another question. Why is my new IDE device located at /dev/sdX and not /dev/hdX as the other IDE devices i have?
[15:59] <Joeseph> mic1394: you mean vlc for ubuntu?
[15:59] <Gnea> m-c: cdrecord
[15:59] <s`s> mic1394: vlc can be installed in windows, linux, AND mac
[15:59] <Gnea> mic1394: vlc
[15:59] <ikonia>  jimmy51 changing it won't do anything I'm more concerned why your config is different than mine out of the box
[15:59] <m-c> Gnea Thank you
[15:59] <ross> gnea: it's installing
[15:59] <mic1394> is there anything better than vlc ? or do u guys suggest anthing else?
[15:59] <jimmy51> ikonia, i'm folliwng this procedure: http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_pxe_install_server
[16:00] <Shujah_> Joeseph, wiki md5 sum :P
[16:00] <Gnea> mic1394: mplayer is nice, but vlc tends to top everything these days
[16:00] <mic1394> hmm
[16:00] <mic1394> thanks everyone
[16:00] <ikonia> jimmy51: that is for version 6.10
[16:00] <ikonia> jimmy51: thats over 18 months old
[16:00] <m-c> Gnea Is the cdrecord application part of the ubuntu repositories?
[16:00] <jimmy51> ikonia: it's for edgy, so i've changed the package to get the hardy packages
[16:01] <ikonia> jimmy51: yes, but more than package names change
[16:01] <ikonia> jimmy51: hardy lays things out very differently
[16:01] <Gnea> m-c: yes
[16:01] <ikonia> jimmy51: for example hardy uses tcpd wrappers, edgy did not
[16:01] <ikonia> jimmy51: you can't mix and match guides like that
[16:01] <m-c> Gnea Just found it, nevermind
[16:01] <Joeseph> Shujah_: that makes sense... so that's how it works... interesting.
[16:01] <jimmy51> ikonia,  is there a 8.04 guide for PXE under ubuntu?

[16:09] <iiinc> Hello. Is there a way to install all of the debug symbol packages for my installed apps? I've added the ddebs repository, I'm just tired of hunting for -dbgsym packages.
[16:09] <jimmy51> ikonia: probably overkill, but it doens't take too long.  thanks for helping thus far
[16:09] <DeFirence> err, its eating my pc from the inside
[16:09] <ikonia> jimmy51: no problem
[16:09] <DeFirence> and i cant do anything

[16:09] <codyzapp> might try recompiling pidgin then.
[16:10] <ikonia> why ?
[16:10] <ikonia> codyzapp: why would recopiling pidgin change that ?
[16:10] <ikonia> recompiling
[16:10] <Blade_Wizard_Fal> s's: didn't work...still the same error...
[16:10] <bartmon> Hmmm, I'm experiencing poor copying performance (<4MB/s) between two HDDs with UDMA6 enabled. Any ideas?
[16:11] <codyzapp> might be a bug in your pidgin. or a missing componet or file etc.
[16:11] <DeFirence> this is the second time this has happened
[16:11] <ikonia> codyzapp: it's precompiled by ubuntu - how could it have  missing file or component
[16:11] <codyzapp> you accidently delete it? or something goes screwy.
[16:12] <d0t> firefox always freezes... :/
[16:12] <ikonia> codyzapp: come on - so surly a re-install of pidgin would be more realistic than a recompile
[16:12] <lesshaste_> how can I switch to some non alsa sound system to see if that will help?
[16:12] <shader42> Starnestommy: ty
[16:13] <DG19075> I'd do a re-install of pidgin from the terminal  and go from there
[16:13] <andare> how do i uninstall ubuntu tweak?
[16:13] <abchirk> tweak?
[16:13] <ikonia> DG19075: why from the terminal ?
[16:13] <threejane> ?
[16:13] <DG19075> apt-get remover --purge ubuntutweak
[16:13] <andare> yes
[16:13] <codyzapp> ikonia, you can see if any errors show up.
[16:14] <ikonia> DG19075: but why suggest from the terminal
[16:14] <ikonia> codyzapp: synaptic will show the same errors
[16:14] <Spockz> Hello, I just tried apt-get update and he can't find the edgy-security sources.
[16:14] <Spockz> Is this because edge-security doesn't exist anymore?
[16:14] <abchirk> andare put in the install cd and install Ubuntu?
[16:14] <DG19075> I've always had good resuls there ; sometinmes a GUI install is buggy
[16:14] <andare> i am try'n to find out how to tweak ubuntu for better performance
[16:14] <ikonia> DG19075: nonsense
[16:15] <andare> i do have ubuntu
[16:15] <abchirk> hm I guess you cannot do so much, you could try to deactivate the automatic services...
[16:15] <andare> ubuntu tweak is a program that i was try'n to use and i don't want it no more
[16:15] <Starnestommy> Spockz: I think edgy isn't supported anymore
[16:15] <ikonia> andare: there is no package for it as I recall, you have to remove it by hand
[16:15] <andare> cuz i am try'n to find out how to tweak the performance
[16:16] <Spockz> Starnestommy: aha, is there a way I can upgrade? Or should I do a new install?
[16:16] <andare> and how would i remove it from hand?
[16:16] <Starnestommy> Spockz: I'm not sure
[16:16] <ikonia> andare: manually remove the files you installed
[16:16] <andare> i'm new use'n liux srry ppl
[16:16] <ikonia> andare: that is one of the downsides of not using package managed software
[16:17] <andare> i don't like to use windows
[16:17] <mitchell> guys i need to mount a digital camera via terminal but is telling me that is not a block device can someone help?
[16:17] <goldenpockets> hoe can i install gcc from the cd?
[16:17] <goldenpockets> how*
[16:17] <ikonia> andare: that doesn't change anything
[16:17] <andare> so that's why i'm use'n liux
[16:17] <legend2440> Blade_Wizard_Fal: in terminal    firefox -safe-mode  does that work?
[16:17] <andare> linux*
[16:17] <ikonia> goldenpockets: put the cd in the driver, view software sources from "system --> administation" enable the CD in the check box and search for GCC
[16:17] <dolley> hola a todos necesito ayuda por favor
[16:18] <ikonia> !es | dolley
[16:18] <ubottu> dolley: En la mayoría de canales Ubuntu se comunica en inglés. Para ayuda en Español, por favor entre en los canales #ubuntu-es o #kubuntu-es.
[16:18] <kaolaBuntuPH> using reiserfs with data=writeback on ubuntu on "/" partition and reiserfs with data=journal on "/home" is this ok guys?
[16:18] <andare> yeah i do understand that doesn't change anyth'n but @ the same time i do know that linux is more secure os than windows
=== Kopfgeldjaeger2 is now known as Kopfgeldjaeger
[16:18] <gigiark> salve a tutti
[16:18] <andare> and that's one of the reasons on why i wanna use linux than windows
[16:18] <Blade_Wizard_Fal> legend2440: i can try...but i just got it working...instead of typing 'firefox' i tried 'firefox-3.0' and it worked...not sure why i suddenly have to do that instead of just firefox though...
[16:18] <ikonia> andare: an OS is as secure as the user who maintains it, ubuntu and any linux distro can be very unsecure
[16:19] <ikonia> !it | gigiark
[16:19] <ubottu> gigiark: Vai su #ubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie!
[16:19] <andare> how?
[16:19] <nixnoob> ikonia: its more secure than running windows as admin at all times no matter how you look at it :)
[16:19] <Blade_Wizard_Fal> legend2440: tried it, didnt work...still says it isnt installed...
[16:19] <ikonia> nixnoob: no it's not, please don't make missleadig comments
[16:19] <andare> i have heard for alot of ppl that are computer geek's that linux is more secure than windows so how can linux NOT be secure?
[16:20] <nixnoob> ikonia: whatever you say.
[16:20] <ikonia> andare: this is not the channel to discuss it, join #ubuntu-offtopic for general discussion, and you can also read up on some generic white papers on security to explain the differences
[16:20] <kaolaBuntuPH> what is a nice backup tool for ubuntu that can restore your software in case of mulfunction
[16:20] <kaolaBuntuPH> ??
[16:20] <kaolaBuntuPH> help plz
[16:20] <nixnoob> ikonia: just compare the number of viruses for each OS, i am right.
[16:20] <kaolaBuntuPH> i had 2 re4mt and update things when my system is down..
[16:20] <ikonia> kaolaBuntuPH: file system backups are the most common way, people chose different sort of methods
[16:21] <andare> ok so what kind of channel is this then if i may ask?
[16:21] <ikonia> nixnoob: we are not discussing virus's - we where discussing security, secrutiy does not mean virus
[16:21] <kaolaBuntuPH> so what software would you recommend on ubuntu
[16:21] <ikonia> andare: an ubuntu OS support channel
[16:21] <puwei> dose ubuntu hase the gohst ,so i can ease recove my OS
[16:21] <andare> show's on how much i know about linux
[16:21] <ikonia> Kopfgeldjaeger: people use basic tools like tar or cpio, or more advanced graphical client server tools like amanda
=== Andy`` is now known as gravity`
[16:22] <ikonia> Kopfgeldjaeger: if you open your package manager and search for backup you'll find a few applications
[16:22] <kaolaBuntuPH> aww
[16:22] <kaolaBuntuPH> no help..huhuhu
[16:22] <nic> hello
[16:22] <kaolaBuntuPH> hello
[16:22] <andare> on one last ? then if u want me to let u alone then i will
[16:22] <ikonia> kaolaBuntuPH: please see the messages I sent to Kopfgeldjaeger:, they where meant for you
[16:22] <nic> how can i change the port in xchat from a irc server? o.O
[16:23] <andare> how can i make the performace look alot better use'n ubuntu?
[16:23] <ikonia> Kopfgeldjaeger: sorry, those messages where not meant for you
[16:23] <ikonia> andare: that depends on the reason it's slow, you need to diagnose why it's slow
[16:23] <kaolaBuntuPH> ok but i want a backup tool that can restore my installed software also
[16:23] <dolley> ok
[16:23] <kaolaBuntuPH> is there?
[16:23] <ikonia> kaolaBuntuPH: then you need some sort of generic whole system image tool
[16:23] <kaolaBuntuPH> how about aptoncd?
[16:23] <andare> i got my computer for about $100 and it was made for windows 2000
[16:24] <trooper> What about PING
[16:24] <kaolaBuntuPH> b
[16:24] <trooper> http://ping.windowsdream.com/
[16:24] <trooper> dont let windowsdream confure you
[16:24] <unop> kaolaBuntuPH, aptoncd is for the purposes of installing ubuntu -- not really backing up and restoring
[16:24] <[globa|fin]> Hey. I want to install xfce. Currently I have Ubuntu 8.04 server install. I installed a GUI by typing [sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop] which installed the latest GNOME. To install Xfce, can I just do [sudo aptitude remove ubuntu-desktop] and then type in [sudo aptitude install xfce]? To installed Xfce?
[16:24] <kaolaBuntuPH> but you can restore softwares using it right?
[16:25] <ikonia> kaolaBuntuPH: no
[16:25] <ikonia> kaolaBuntuPH: it makes a local repo, nothing more
[16:25] <andare> so then i guess my computer is really slow cuz i don't have the $$$ to upgrade so that's why i'm try'n to learn how to tweak and overclock if it's possible for my computer to even handle it
[16:25] <unop> kaolaBuntuPH, not necessarily -- it's quite possible that you upgraded packages from the online repositories and in the process pulled in other dependencies too
[16:25] <ikonia> andare: overclocking is a bad idea
[16:25] <kaolaBuntuPH> so no software installed will be reinstalled then?
[16:25] <ikonia> andare: and is not something that is a topic in this channel
[16:25] <j800r> yo, i need repository help. i'm having problems with the medibuntu repository when i use update manager
[16:25] <andare> then what about tweaking?
[16:25] <nickrud> [globa|fin] there's more to removing gnome, but you can install sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop to run xfce. Just choose it under options->sessions on the login screen
[16:25] <andare> ok srry
[16:25] <ikonia> andare: how much ram do you have ?
[16:25] <kaolaBuntuPH> can u gve me a specific name for the image copy thing for ubuntu?
[16:26] <nickrud> [globa|fin] to be clear, you don't have to remove gnome to install xfce.
[16:26] <kaolaBuntuPH> can sbackup do it also?
[16:26] <andare> sd 765 mb
[16:26] <ikonia> kaolaBuntuPH: you have been given a few,
[16:26] <ikonia> andare: and what cpu ?
[16:26] <sHOCkwAV1> Anyone here familiar with configuring ubuntu and a linksys wpc54gs card?
[16:26] <kaolaBuntuPH> guess i have to search
[16:26] <nickrud> kaolaBuntuPH yes, sbackup will do it if you set it up properly.
[16:26] <andare> i don't know my cpu
[16:26] <andare> srry
[16:26] <[globa|fin]> nickrud, thank you for your response. Say I want to remove xfce later, can I just type [sudo aptitude remove xubuntu-desktop]? Thanks
[16:26] <kaolaBuntuPH> ok thanks for the help
[16:26] <ikonia> kaolaBuntuPH: or just read the messages people are giving you
[16:27] <Ayabara> I have removed Medibuntu from sources.list, but apt still looks for updates there. Why oh why?
[16:27] <andare> i don't know computer hard ware very much

[16:28] <Ayabara> ikonia, I've done that (loads of times)

[16:33] <Illuzionz> thnx for the help j800r , it works perfectly!!!
[16:34] <Slart> lil-romeo: it's not a command  =).. first run gconf-editor
[16:34] <lil-romeo> yes

[16:34] <unop> kaolaBuntuPH, because gksudo setups the environment  for X apps in a proper way
[16:34] <Slart> lil-romeo: you're welcome
[16:34] <dolley> ho db92
[16:34] <j800r> illutionz: ya, i've had the same problem before
[16:34] <andare> what's a really good linux distro for a newbie towards linux?
[16:34] <lil-romeo> gconf editor
[16:34] <iter> and how would I force-upgrade the kernel (or any single package) via apt-get or dpkg
[16:34] <lil-romeo> were does it stands:P
[16:34] <unop> andare, ubuntu
[16:34] <lil-romeo> know im a noob
[16:35] <Slart> andare: since you're asking here.. ubuntu? =)
[16:35] <DarkAudit> aha... ping: unknown host packages.medibuntu.org :(
[16:35] <kaolaBuntuPH> unop: ok, I've been using sudo fine on mine..but thanks for the Opinion

[16:35] <db92> dolley, which is yer card? >>
[16:35] <dolley> my video card is this: vias3g-unichrome
[16:35] <sHOCkwAV1> Hello, I need help configuring my wireless card. It's not working with ubuntu.
[16:35] <lil-romeo> a now i know :D
[16:35] <nickrud> andare #ubuntu, definitely. suse or mandriva aren't too hard, either
[16:35] <db92> o.0
[16:35] <DarkAudit> and knowing is half the battle :)
[16:35] <lil-romeo> hmm
[16:35] <dolley> is my video chip
[16:35] <db92> dolley, how about make model? :P
[16:35] <j800r> i'd say a linux newbie dist would be kubuntu
[16:35] <dolley> i have an laptop
[16:36] <unop> kaolaBuntuPH, if you recommend people use sudo with X apps like that, they will develop the habit, and it's not a good habit to develop -- see !worksforme
[16:36] <j800r> the kde desktop is more familiar to windows users
[16:36] <dolley> this S3G-Linux-x86-2.0.16
[16:36] <kaolaBuntuPH> ﻿sHOCkwAV1: just google your wireless card, forums may help you bout it
[16:36] <nickrud> kaolaBuntuPH it's not an opinion, there's very good reasons. Not least, the possibility of writing config's in your home directory owned by root
[16:36] <andare> so how would i be able to use ubuntu aka linux without be'n a pain in someone's back side?

[16:37] <j800r> ubuntu has most stuff there already
[16:37] <db92> dolley, what you are telling me seems irrelevant :P try an lspci in terminal and tell me where it says ati or nvidia
[16:37] <lil-romeo> well mate i cant find gconf-editor, apps, nautilus
[16:37] <nickrud> andare we're accustomed to pains in the backside here :) Usually they stop being a pain and become an asset
[16:37] <lil-romeo> gconf editor
[16:37] <lil-romeo> were to find it?
[16:37] <Slart> lil-romeo: start a terminal
[16:37] <lil-romeo> yes
[16:37] <unop> kaolaBuntuPH, and we're telling you that it's collective opinion that your way is a bad way -- no offence intended
[16:37] <Slart> lil-romeo: then type gconf-editor
[16:37] <Cervellinux> sorry
[16:37] <kaolaBuntuPH> ﻿unop: well i'm going to try wht u've teached me..thanks
[16:38] <andare> be able to do kool thing's with it i guess
[16:38] <lil-romeo> cool dude
[16:38] <DarkAudit> andare: I usually google "ubuntu <problem I'm having>" first... in most cases there's a forum post about it already :)
[16:38] <lil-romeo> appz nautilus
[16:38] <andare> kool
[16:38] <Ayabara> !eclipse
[16:38] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about eclipse

=== njpatel is now known as njpatel_away
[17:43] <keanu> I'm having problems playing music from my DNS-323 (NAS).  I've tried playing both FLAC and MP3 on Amarok, VLC, Totem, and xine, and all four act like they're starting to play, but don't.  skipping to the next track causes each to freeze.  I've rebooted both this laptop and the DNS-323 with no fix.  Same music plays fine on the windows laptop.  Ideas?
[17:43] <Shujah> norman_x, if you just wanna surf medibuntu for info you can try the cache in google
[17:43] <umadaop1> Sockmonkey, your router manual or support group. This is ubuntu support.
[17:44] <Seveas> keanu, does it play when you first copy the music to a local disk?
[17:44] <norman_x> Shujah: thanks for the hint, but I am installing a PC and need it for that
[17:44] <Sockmonkey> Oh, I thought I could come here because I'm trying to get it on ubuntu. And the manual offers no help. XD
[17:44] <Sockmonkey> Thanks anyway
[17:44] <poningru> keanu: hmm
[17:44] <drenz> how to install adobe flash player on ubuntu 6.06?
[17:44] <umadaop1> keanu, do you have the proper codec installed?
[17:44] <Seveas> drenz, sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[17:44] <poningru> keanu: can you try increasing the cache?
[17:44] <poningru> and are you sure you have mp3 support?
[17:45] <keanu> umadaop1, unless something broke last night.  Everything's been working fine for months until now
[17:45] <drenz> seveas thanx
[17:45] <umadaop1> keanu, connection issues?
[17:45] <poningru> keanu: oh first question how are you connecting to the nas?
[17:45] <drenz> Seveas:  apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[17:45] <drenz> Seveas:  dont work
[17:45] <noodlesgc> is anyone else not getting to medibuntu.org ?
[17:45] <Shujah> drenz, adding sudo might help
[17:45] <drenz> E: Couldn't find package flashplugin-nonfree
[17:45] <umadaop1> !flash|drenz
[17:45] <ubottu> drenz: To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash (a recent version for !Dapper is available in !backports) - See also !Restricted and !Gnash
[17:45] <drenz> i added sudo
[17:46] <keanu> poningru, both laptops are  wireless, nas isn't.
[17:46] <keanu> umadaop1, I'd assume restarting both would fix any connection issues
[17:46] <virious> Does anyone know how to manually configure grub to dual boot with windows which resides on my second HDD?  I have gotten close; grub says starting but nothing starts

=== braden_ is now known as zod21
[17:47] <umadaop1> keanu, can you ping the device?
[17:47] <Shujah> virious, two hds? ensure the windows grub entry reflects the correct hd i.e. hd0 or hd1
[17:47] <umadaop1> keanu, has the ip addresses changed on the network?
[17:47] <keanu> umadaop1, I can ping and connect to it fine
[17:47] <UserNew> hi all
[17:47] <zod21> eh man
[17:47] <umadaop1> yo
[17:47] <virious> Shujah, I tried that hd1 and the first partition
[17:48] <keanu> OK, definitely a problem with this laptop - copied the files onto the hard drive as Seveas suggested, and they still don't play.  totem recognizes how long the music is (and ID3 tags) but doesn't play it
[17:48] <xintron> Is there a way to inactivate the trashbin? So that files is deleted directly instead of moved to the trash (I know about shift+delete, but I still wants to delete directly)?
[17:49] <keanu> same with amarok
[17:49] <umadaop1> xintron, nautilus preferences
[17:49] <Seveas> keanu, that could be a codec problem. Install mplayer/ffmpeg/w32codecs and try with mplayer
[17:49] <virious> Try to play the music or videos with VLC I have had great success with that
[17:49] <Robzy> hey guys
[17:50] <umadaop1> yo
[17:50] <Robzy> how can i compile a ubuntu package from source?

[17:50] <Ab3L> hello
[17:50] <umadaop1> !source| Robzy
[17:50] <ubottu> Robzy: You can easily fetch a package's source with apt-get. See: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
[17:50] <Robzy> thanks ubottu :)
[17:50] <td123> Robzy: you can always get the source on the projects site
[17:50] <umadaop1> Don't mention it
[17:50] <xintron> umadaop1: ty
[17:50] <Robzy> td123: nah, I'm wanting the ubuntu source in particular
[17:50] <umadaop1> xintron, yw
[17:51] <Robzy> with ubuntu patches and all that jazz
[17:51] <td123> Robzy: ook
[17:51] <Robzy> (cause life would be boring without openssl vulns :P)
[17:51] <Shujah> virious, whats in grub about windows?
[17:51] <keanu> virious, VLC acts like it's playing (seconds played is changing) but it doesn't recognize the track length, and there's no sound.  checked vlc, alsamixer, and pulseaudio, everything's set to max (except pulseaudio, but still isn't muted)
[17:51] <legend2440> xintron: in terminal gconf-editor then browse to     /apps/nautilus/preferences/enable_delete
[17:52] <umadaop1> legend2440, thats alot to just enable it from nautilus' check box
[17:53] <legend2440> umadaop1: yes forgot it was in nautilus preferences

[17:57] <MXIIA> Well, I have HP C4385, I chose C4380... 85 wasn't an option.

[18:21] <Oswy> I just installed Hardy on my computer with Edgy right now. When I boot, though, I can only get to the GRUB loader with Edgy on it, so I have no way to access Hardy at all. Can someone help me? It may be a BIOS issue or something, but I checked the boot priority and that was fine.
[18:21] <Seveas> Lusule, yup, you need to modify xorg.conf and will lose compiz
[18:21] <Lusule> will lose compiz?
[18:21] <__ryan__> is there anyway to change the ubuntu icon on the applications tab at the top left corner of gnome?
[18:21] <Lusule> how do i modify xorg.conf?
[18:22] <Matthew12> Can someone help me figure out why a black background appears around the edges of Cairo Dock, when I mouse over the apps?
[18:22] <Seveas> Lusule, __ryan__ locate distributor-logo, and change that picture :)
[18:22] <__ryan__> Seveas,  thanks
[18:22] <Seveas> (locate distributor-logo is a command you need to run)
[18:22] <carib909> seveas can you take a look at my pastebin ?
[18:24] <__ryan__> Seveas,  any idea which one it is, quite a few come up
[18:24] <Lusule> erg sorry seveas, i'm getting confused ><  i'll look it up online

[18:26] <wols_> Oswy: is edgy still on the disk?
[18:26] <Oswy> Yeah.
[18:26] <Oswy> Err, no.
[18:26] <Oswy> They're on different HDs.
[18:26] <wols_> Oswy: ubuntu can only handle one version at the same time. you must edit your menu.lst by hand
[18:26] <suselin> if vbox 1.6 is not in the repo(synaptic) is there a site that i can get the ubuntu version (of 1.6)
[18:27] <wols_> the edgy menu.lst that is
[18:27] <Oswy> wols_: How do I do that?
[18:27] <Oswy> ie, where is the file?
[18:27] <wols_> by editing it. reading grub docs for starters. /boot/grub/menu.lst
[18:27] <Xucrute> After an update I lost gnome in my  hardy machine. All I get is text based login. What should I do?
[18:27] <wols_> the edgy menu.lst. NOT the hardy one
[18:27] <Oswy> OK, thanks, I'll try that.
[18:27] <wols_> Xucrute: install gdm
[18:27] <sree> Shujah: There is no info about the CD/USB drives
[18:28] <Xucrute> wols_. thanks .. will see that

[18:28] <Oswy> wols_: What, so do I just cut out all the stuff currently there?
[18:28] <wols_> no. then you lose edgy. you add the entries for hardy. no I'm no gonna walk you through it and feed it to you
[18:29] <sree> Shujah: There is no option such as automount
[18:29] <Oswy> wols_: Fair enough.

[18:29] <Seveas> !ubuntu | jam4
[18:29] <ubottu> jam4: Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. It is developed by a large community and we invite you to participate too! - Also see http://www.ubuntu.com
[18:30] <jam4> How do I get Ubuntu?
[18:30] <sree> Shujah: I see thanks. Let me check again
[18:30] <Nix> anyone have any idea on how to get socks4 working with curl?

[18:31] <Shujah> sree, if that doesnt work terminal > gconf-editor    apps > nautilus > preferences [see if automount is checked]
[18:31] <jam4> Why is Ubuntu better than other operating systems
[18:31] <Seveas> Nix, according to ist manpage: curl --socks4 <host[:port]>

[18:33] <n0gear> how do i change my grub loader? Need to get the win as a default
[18:33] <Reformer81> I used Compiz with the AWN dock.  However, there are times when I need to turn off Compiz (switching to metacity) and I lose the dock.  So my question is this:  How can I create a panel in Gnome that disappears while Compiz & AWN are running, but comes back when I disable Compiz?
[18:33] <netcatc> hello folks
[18:33] <sree> Shujah: No the previous step has no effect. in gconf automount is enabled but automount is not working. Ive tried that earlier
[18:33] <Seveas> n0gear, gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst, move the entry with windows to above the line that says AUTOMAGIC KERNEL LIST

[18:35] <netcatc> what do I make ?
[18:35] <d0t> in case i want to make a partition of FAT32 on my HD (ext3) do i HAVE to reboot into the liveCD or can i just make it straight away?
[18:36] <wols_> Xucrute: dpkg -l |grep ubuntu-desktop
[18:36] <sree> Shujah: No the previous step has no effect. in gconf automount is enabled but automount is not working. Ive tried that earlier
[18:36] <wols_> d0t: you can make it straight away. unmount the ext3 and reforamt it. you cannot change the root partition to fat however
[18:36] <carib909> grrrrrrrrrrrr!!! can get sound!  can install alsa driver  Help pleeeeeeease?
[18:36] <Nix> Use of undefined constant CURLPROXY_SOCKS4
[18:37] <Lusule> Seveas - thanks a load, that worked!  Slight risk of losing programs off the top but i'll live with that
[18:37] <Seveas> Lusule, you're welcome :)

[18:37] <wols_> d0t: which one?
[18:38] <Xucrute>  I think I will reinstall eeverything again
[18:38] <d0t> should i use gparted instead?
[18:38] <wols_> Xucrute: reinstall gnome. it was removed for some reason

[18:38] <Seveas> wols_, he did ask before :)
[18:38] <edju> What happened to medibuntu.org?  It can't reslove.
[18:38] <Xucrute> wols_.  many apps seem to have gone... even firefox

[18:39] <ubottu> edju: medibuntu is a repository of packages that cannot be included into the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons - See http://www.medibuntu.org - it is currently offline due to load issues

[18:39] <d0t> wols_:  do i need to run cfdisk </dev/blah> ?

[18:39] <Xucrute> wols_.  will do. THanks!!
[18:39] <edju> Well, that answers that!

[18:40] <redduck676> kafitz: what kind of mess?
[18:40] <wols_> netcatc: use a live CD and check what's still there of the partition
[18:40] <kafitz> i installed it from source, ran into so difficulties and now need help uninstalling it
[18:40] <kafitz> so i can do it from apt-get
[18:40] <carib909> seveas, what should i repeat?
[18:40] <kafitz> ive tried removing everything
[18:40] <redduck676> kafitz: if you still have a source do ''make uninstall''
[18:40] <Seveas> carib909, you should *stop* repeating your question every minute
[18:40] <wols_> kafitz: ask who gave you the source how to unisntall. or read the docs. there is no standard way of uninstalling self compiled source. that's a big reason we discourage it
[18:40] <Shujah-1> sree, check this out > http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html  -- might help
[18:40] <netcatc> wols_: already am witch Live Cd at moment
[18:40] <redduck676> kafitz: and no, apt-get won't help you removing stuff you compiled by hand
[18:40] <kafitz> make uninstall only worked for liltorrent
[18:40] <netcatc> wols_: /dev/sda3            8111       18159    80718592+  83  Linux
[18:41] <d0t> wols_:  cfdisk /dev/sdb works fine :) thanks.
[18:41] <wols_> netcatc: so it's ther
[18:41] <kafitz> theres a make clean for rtorrent and make distclean
[18:41] <sree> Shujah: OK
[18:41] <carib909> If you read the two questions you will see that one said can the oher corrected it to can and added the pastebin link.

So my question is this:  How can I create a panel in Gnome that disappears while Compiz & AWN are running, but comes back when I disable Compiz?
[18:41] <carib909> can´t
[18:41] <redduck676> kafitz: you can look at the files in the install target and remove them by hand.
[18:41] <wols_> netcatc: file -s  the partition
[18:41] <redduck676> (next time use aptitude to install it in the first place)
[18:41] <baconnessie> kafitz: you can look at the files in the install target and remove them by hand.
[18:42] <d0t> wols_: do i need to delete the partition and then resize it ?
[18:42] <baconnessie> (next time use aptitude to install it in the files in the first place)
[18:42] <kafitz> ok, i will try that then
[18:42] <netcatc> wols_: data
[18:42] <wols_> redduck676: that would mean he understands waht a makefile means
[18:42] <kafitz> yeah, i will
[18:42] <wols_> d0t: why?
[18:42] <netcatc> wols_: dev/sda3: data
[18:42] <wols_> netcatc: seems you hosed your sda3
[18:42] <baconnessie> netcatc: file -s
[18:42] <d0t> wols_: so how can i resize it ?
[18:43] <Shujah-1> Reformer81, as far as I know only way to do that would be to increase the unhide time of bottom panel 10 times and use awn on top of it
[18:43] <wols_> d0t: you can etierh delte it and recreate it at the new size or use gparted
[18:43] <baconnessie> kafitz: you can look at the files in the install target and remove them by hand.
[18:43] <Reformer81> Shujah-1: Hmm... I guess that is doable.
[18:43] <baconnessie> yeah, i will try that would be to increase the new size or use awn on top of it
[18:43] <Reformer81> Thank you
[18:43] <netcatc> baconnessie: /dev/sda3 data
[18:44] <kafitz> sorry for being naive, but how do i find the install target?
[18:44] <baconnessie> wols_: so how can i guess that is doable.
[18:44] <sree> Shujah: I Think there is no problem with my fstab. It is something else
[18:44] <baconnessie> i guess that is doable.
[18:44] <netcatc> baconnessie: must mount the partition
[18:44] <baconnessie> baconnessie: /dev/sda3 data

[18:47] <Malix> hi all. How do you get rid of firefox3.0 beta 5. no matter what I do, thats what I get when I install firefox from official hardy repository
[18:47] <trooper> is there a gnome-panel-applet around that shows BOTH cpu temperature and frequency with the possiblity to alter the frequency like cpufreq-selector does?
[18:47] <trakinas> xkcd pws!
[18:47] <Myrtti> Seveas: better than telling why it's doing that for real ;-)
[18:47] <Shujah-1> Reformer81, didnt work?
[18:47] <threedee> I'd like to download the source for commands "ls" and "cd". How can I do that. Thankyou.
[18:47] <trooper> err that doesnt show both but lets one choose the frequency from it :-)
[18:47] <Seveas> threedee, apt-get source coreutils
[18:47] <pakonja> Seveas, direct rendering: Yes, that means I got it installed... thanks
[18:47] <DarkAudit> Malix: do you have the updates repository enabled?
[18:47] <threedee> Seveas: Thankyou very much
[18:48] <Reformer81> Shujah-1: Oh, not that.  I haven't tried it yet :)  I'm sure it will work, though.
[18:48] <netcatc> wols_: reiserfsck --rebuild-tree
[18:48] <Reformer81> Shujah-1: But then I'm still going to need to take extra steps to make the gnome panel useful after disabling compiz.
[18:48] <Sinister> why does devede take so damn long i have 4gb ram a 3.2 dual core pent 4 and it takes hours whats the deal is there anything faster ?

[18:48] <Malix> DarkAudit: yes I do
[18:48] <wols_> netcatc: with reiser? good luck. lol

[18:48] <Shujah-1> Reformer81, make sure hide time is super short too & hide pixel are 0.
[18:49] <MethodOne> threedee: ls is part of coreutils, and cd is part of bash. run the command apt-get source coreutils or apt-get source bash
[18:49] <Malix> DarkAudit: it says the candidate version is: 3.0+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1, but still I get 3.0b5 o_O

[18:49] <keanu> asked this earlier but had to leave - yesterday I was able to play music fine in amarok (it's all I've been using) and was able to play files locally and from my NAS.  Today, I can't play any mp3 or flac (don't have any others to test) in Amarok, VLC, totem, mplayer, or xine.  any ideas on how to fix it?

[18:50] <Pici> IdleOne: Finished?
[18:50] <netcatc> wols_: thanks for incentive
[18:50] <Malix> gnomefreak: whats 'proposed' in kubuntu terms
[18:51] <keanu> wraund, nope.  it acts like it's about to play, and just sits there doing nothing.  skipping to the next track (which also doesn't work) in most of the above programs causes them to freeze
[18:51] <wraund> ahh..
[18:51] <wraund> close it all down
[18:51] <gnomefreak> Malix: proposed is a repo that is used to push packages to before they go into update (im fairly sure its updates)
[18:51] <wraund> then open a terminal, and run 'killall amarokapp' without quotes
[18:51] <wraund> then type amarok
[18:51] <wraund> and press enter
[18:51] <graft> does anyone have an audio setup that "just works", i.e. all applications can use the sound card without interference or crashing simultaneously? and if so, how was it achieved?
[18:51] <wraund> see if errors are displayed there :)
[18:51] <Lusule> quick question:  assume i've installed this on a small fraction of my drive and now decide i like it - can i expand it to get rid of windows completely, or do i have to reinstall?
[18:51] <Malix> gnomefreak: but I have all those enabled o_O
[18:51] <gnomefreak> Malix: once in proposed it needs testing before it hits normal repos
[18:51] <keanu> wraund, I've restarted both the NAS and laptop several times with no luck.
[18:52] <wraund> keanu: see if any terminal messages appear
[18:52] <gnomefreak> Malix: no you dont. you dont have proposed if you didnt add it

[18:53] <keanu> wraund, no errors when trying to play music - it just sits there doing nothing
[18:53] <wraund> ok
[18:53] <gnomefreak> Malix: 3.0.1 is in proposed it is next security point release

[18:53] <wraund> what is it using
[18:53] <gnomefreak> Malix: but it will your repos in a week or so
[18:54] <gnomefreak> Malix: final is in -updates
[18:54] <Reformer81> Shujah-1: Well, this will work for now.  But I'm curious... isn't there someway to modify the panel's configuration file on the fly?  For example, set a "visible" attribute to zero?
[18:54] <Malix> atleast I have it on _this_ computer, but on the other it reverted to b5 o_O
[18:54] <keanu> wraund, xine
[18:54] <oobe> im having a problem with cron not working is there somthing special i need to do to get cron to work
[18:54] <gnomefreak> Malix: 3.0.1 is newer than final
[18:54] <Malix> gnomefreak: well, obviously, but isn't there 3.0 final in the normal repositories?
[18:54] <Malix> no?
[18:54] <wraund> keanu: and what is the output plugin shown as?
[18:54] <wols_> Malix: apt-cache policy   for ffox3?
[18:54] <graft> Shujah-1: hm, okay, trying that
[18:54] <gnomefreak> Malix: than you need to update it becasue only one not updated to final is in gutsy and im working on that sort of
[18:54] <DarkAudit> Malix: -updates, not the main ones

[18:55] <gnomefreak> Malix: yes its in -updates repo
[18:55] <carib909> No sound, cannot find card! how to fix?
[18:55] <gnomefreak> Malix: not in gutsy only hardy
[18:55] <Shujah-1> Reformer81, you can probably make a script for it, place it on the desktop - But I gather that would be too much hassle for something like that
[18:55] <wraund> keanu: what options does the drop down menu give you
[18:55] <Malix> gnomefreak: I have hardy
[18:55] <wols_> !sound | carib909
[18:55] <ubottu> carib909: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
