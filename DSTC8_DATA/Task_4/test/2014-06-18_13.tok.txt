<s> hey , i 've never done <user> before , any tricks on getting it back in ? </s>
<s> the <user> is a good place to start . try removing all sticks of <user> and booting , if it works : add one at a time until you find the dead one . </s>
<s> just make sure it 's the right way around ( will only go one way ) then just push hard , it takes a bit of force to get the <unka> back down . </s>

<s> no i do n't , and i 'm jobless atm , so i would really rather not go get one </s>
<s> by failing , i mean could it not be loading </s>
<s> </s>
<s> sounds like some sort of motherboard issue , weather bios or full blown dead mother board it 's hard to say </s>
<s> ok , could just eliminate the power supply with one . does n't sound too promising though . </s>
<s> it might be bios i think ... but power supply is a good idea too </s>
<s> ^^ </s>
<s> any ideas ? </s>
<s> if it 's a power problem , would the fan and hard drive be spinning ? </s>
<s> <user> , are you getting any fans or anything ? no light on the case ? </s>
<s> all the lights are working properly </s>
<s> fans and hard drives are spinning </s>
<s> yeh hanna , they can , could have 12v but not 5v . seen that before . </s>
<s> then its bios i think </s>
<s> ok so ps ( powersupply ) sounds fine </s>
<s> is it very old ? </s>
<s> what is <user> issue ? i might have had something similar before . </s>
<s> not so fast on that one <user> , seen one rail of a supply go down and keep things like fans happy . could be as simple as no power good line . </s>
<s> no , got it winter 2010 </s>
<s> <user> , she cant boot up it seems </s>
<s> no beeps , no keyboard lights </s>
<s> alright , where does it fail in the boot process ? </s>
<s> so you see the bios screen ? </s>
<s> from the get go </s>
<s> there is no boot process . </s>
<s> i do n't know . no display , no bios </s>
<s> no video either </s>
<s> she sees nothing at all </s>
<s> yeah , hardware failure . </s>
<s> well , maybe </s>
<s> it could be bios </s>
<s> we made it that far :) </s>
<s> it 's not the gpu , and it 's not the <user> </s>
<s> if you do n't see the bios screen at all , you motherboard may be fried . </s>
<s> pretty unlikely tux , if no sign of life at all . more likely mb </s>
<s> what is your motherboard model ? </s>
<s> that 's where i 'm headed </s>
<s> okay , good point </s>
<s> i have had the same thing before . </s>
<s> how could that have happened though ? it was working fine before i opened it </s>
<s> me too </s>
<s> luckily motherboards are not too expensive . </s>
<s> been a while since i 've had a hardware failure of this magnitude </s>
<s> you opened it ? what did you do once inside ? </s>
<s> it 's a hp <unk#a> , all stock except graphics </s>
<s> <user> lots of reasons , possibly a fault in the product . how old is the motherboard ? </s>
<s> i <unka> the hard drive to see if it was loose , ( it 's not ), then i blew out some dust </s>
<s> since it 's stock , how old is the machine itself </s>
<s> 2010 </s>
<s> <unk#a> here :) canada ? </s>
<s> no , arizona </s>

<s> at least it is failing before that point . </s>
<s> yeah , thre 's 5 leds , labelled <unk#a-> , and <unk#a> is lit green </s>
<s> green is usually a positive color </s>
<s> alright , so in the motherboard manual that probably means something , green usually indicates good . </s>
<s> only if it 's a dual color led </s>
<s> do you hear the disk spinning ? </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> so , hypothetically if the motherboard isnt failing or dead , what could it be ? </s>
<s> so alternatively you may not be seeing the bios screen because you are n't rendering the framebuffer to a monitor ... </s>
<s> and it is booting . </s>
<s> i heard the disk spinning when it first <unka,> not afterwards </s>
<s> <user> : try this URL/http:/ URL/stackoverflow.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> oh , hmm </s>
<s> still sounds like a motherboard failure . </s>
<s> when you try to cold boot , from fully off , does one of the led 's blink in a pattern ? </s>
<s> what component on the board did you change when it started failing </s>
<s> could it be a virus ? i agree with mb failure but is a virus a possibility ? </s>
<s> or did it randomly fail this morning ? </s>
<s> thanks , i 'll try it again </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> worked , thanks </s>
<s> <user> little or no chance its a virus . </s>

<s> <user> : np </s>
<s> and no , would n't be that . </s>
<s> <user> : the light is always on , nothing changes when i boot </s>
<s> either your gpu or motherboard has failed . </s>
<s> sounds like the motherboard . </s>
<s> if you have another board you can test the gpu in isolation </s>
<s> so there is no error code via led </s>
<s> do you have a spare ? </s>
<s> or psu </s>
<s> <user> : the failure did n't randomly happen , it happened after i took it apart to do a little cleaning </s>
<s> :/ static damage ? </s>
<s> oh you could have shorted out the board </s>
<s> i took the gpu out to see if the computer would boot without it , and no dice </s>
<s> <user> , <user> , use nicks to preface answers to others here please </s>
<s> <unka> , sure no problem </s>
<s> if it 's static damage or a short , can it be fixed , or am i out of luck </s>
<s> i actually had a question of my own , but i thought i would earn some credit before asking it :p i do n't know if i have been that much help . </s>
