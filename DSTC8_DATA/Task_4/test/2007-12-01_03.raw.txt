[01:26] <thor> ToddEDM: it will ask if you want to accept the key...say yes...it will only ask the first time
[01:26] <LjL> K_Dallas, i'm not very experienced with sound and ALSA to be honest. besides telling you the obvious - i.e. to make sure everything relevant is enabled and set to a medium volume in the system mixer - i'm not sure what to tell you
[01:26] <Jack_Sparrow> jpastore: possibley...  you are trying to burn or copy a mounted iso?
[01:26] <scguy318> ToddEDM: well, substitute the IP address for desktopip
[01:26] <Hanyou> Nope I get to 192.168.0.1 and connection stops, just on the desktop though. Not the laptop or the 50 windows boxes sitting in the office.
[01:26] <thor> ToddEDM:no..you need the ip address of the desktop....192.168.0.3 or whatever
[01:26] <ToddEDM> hey thor, gimme a sec, i gotta take a piss
[01:26] <ToddEDM> ok
[01:26] <jpastore> Jack_Sparrow, well interestingly enough i used a cd burned from this image to install into a vm under virtual box before...I just really trashed it...and deleted it ...so I'm starting over
[01:27] <fungz0r> hey whats the best linux internet browser?
[01:27] <fungz0r> firefox?
[01:27] <Jack_Sparrow> jpastore: ok.. good luck..
[01:27] <jpastore> Jack_Sparrow, nah...it's on my desktop I copied it from my external last time my laptop was on and I just turned it on...it's not mounted anywhere
[01:27] <Jack_Sparrow> !best
[01:27] <ubotu> Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[01:27] <Hanyou> danbhfive: Maybe I can restart it into submission like I did with my laptop lol.
[01:27] <jaydedrag0n_girl> LjL: just because someone is new and knows their way around their file structure.. does not automatically infer that they know everything about their system.. it does not make them dumb or stupid just new... i know a few commands my way around my file structure.. pretty good with compiz... but do i know what nautilus is? no not really i'm sure i could read up on it... but that doesn't make me stupid just new
[01:27] <scguy318> fungz0r: depends on your needs
[01:27] <jpastore> !best getting some
[01:27] <n215> how do i setup default gw for nas0 interface that wasnt created yet?

[01:28] <danbhfive> hanyou: lol, thats a windows skill  :p
[01:28] <fungz0r> well better question, what browsers are you guys using?
[01:28] <LjL> jaydedrag0n_girl, it surely doesn't make you stupid. but saying annoyed-sounding things like "i know my way round ubuntu, k?" to people who're trying to help sounds arrogant. not stupid, just arrogant.
[01:28] <LjL> fungz0r: all 1152 of us?
[01:28] <fungz0r> haha
[01:28] <fungz0r> if all 1152 is actually here :P

[01:30] <danbhfive> hanyou: do you know how to restart the networking from the CLI?  I believe its sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[01:30] <ToddEDM> whew!!!! im back
[01:30] <Hanyou> danbhfive: Do you think it could be b/c I have two network cards that it is confusing the Linux config?
=== CAP2559 is now known as OncrAckz

[01:31] <Jack_Sparrow> jpastore: The discussion at the end of the article says k3b does burn bootable cd's...

[01:32] <jimjam> Is there any way to see *all* files on a computer that have changed in the last x number of days?
[01:32] <fungz0r> well danbhfive, i know that one, but is there a way so that whenver i just click on it, its already highlighted?
[01:32] <Invert314> i need a better word than thing
[01:32] <jpastore> Jack_Sparrow, that's annoying I read that it doesn't and stopped there...why contradict yourself...that's just bad writing
[01:32] <thor> ToddEDM: the prompt should change to reflect that you are now at a prompt on the desktop

[01:32] <n215> how do i setup default gw in startup for nas0 interface that wasnt created yet??
[01:32] <Jack_Sparrow> jpastore: that was a comment from a user.
[01:32] <thor> ToddEDM: no problem..you need to start sshd...the magic incantation....
[01:32] <Ongaku> hmm well rhythmbox and amarok are acting funny...i can play a song, but when i switch to a different song it freezes

[01:33] <user1> how to tell alsa to use my creative card (i have 2 cards)
[01:33] <ToddEDM> on desktop ?
[01:33] <thor> ToddEDM: right
[01:33] <Jack_Sparrow> jpastore: I also never said k3b wouldnt, just that there was an easier way to burn bootable iso's
[01:33] <jpastore> Jack_Sparrow, ahhh...well let me give it another go maybe I'll try burning directly from my external...maybe the copy was bad

[01:34] <PeteOnline> Anyone know of a website with a really good description of static routing on a standard ipv4 network?  I know this isn't exactly the best place to ask this, but it does involve staticly routing my ubuntu server
[01:35] <jimjam> jrib: I was looking at -ctime, but I can't figure out which order my arguments should go in.
[01:35] <Hanyou> Anyone have any other ideas?

[01:37] <ToddEDM> how the hell do you remember all this , with the names of these linux programs so phucked

[01:37] <danbhfive> hanyou: im not the most knowledgable about these things, but I have heard that routers can block individual ports
[01:37] <Pici> openmindDJ: Its in the Nautilus preferences.
[01:37] <ToddEDM> haha
[01:37] <openmindDJ> ohh yea....
[01:37] <thor> ToddEDM: and I was lucky enough to find someone to help when I was sitting there where you are <smile>
[01:37] <Ongaku> hmm well rhythmbox and amarok are acting funny...i can play a song, but when i switch to a different song it freezes
[01:37] <ToddEDM> ok i got all that installed on the desktop.. and restarted xinetd
[01:38] <Hanyou> danbhfive: Went through that with the laptop. All that was left when I was done was me to terminal into my Cisco Gateway and rewrite my routing table.
[01:38] <ToddEDM> yeah i thank you thor
[01:38] <jimjam> jrib; Oh! Thanks!
[01:38] <scguy318> ToddEDM: old age and experience :P

[01:39] <duende> mnklnion
[01:39] <ToddEDM> thor , you realize, now i will be looking for you EVERYTIME i have a problem!
[01:39] <Jack_Sparrow> kakoonia: dont suppose you made any backups
[01:39] <scguy318> kakoonia: like downgrading version? no
[01:40] <Hanyou> danbhfive: I'm pretty swift when it comes to anything PC or Apple related, but this has me tied upside down on a freeway overpass.
[01:40] <jimjam> jrib: Any way I can copy all of those files?
[01:40] <kakoonia> jack
[01:40] <thor> ToddEDM: and most importantly...everything you do is via ssh...and encrypted channel...so it is about as safe as it can get
[01:40] <scguy318> kakoonia: you could clean install but that's not typical meaning of downgrade in the usual sense
[01:40] <ToddEDM> cool
[01:40] <thor> ToddEDM: we will make it a little safer later...
[01:40] <thor> ToddEDM: now...when you are done....type 'exit' and you should return to the laptop prompt
[01:40] <thor> ToddEDM: take your time
[01:40] <jrib> jimjam: you can use -exec cp (see examples in find's man page) or pipe to  xargs cp

=== Amaranth_ is now known as Amaranth
[01:41] <ztomic> I could swear this is caused by the linux-kernel-rt: "There was an error starting GNOME settings daemon... will try to restart the next time you log in." I have two computers that started doing this after upgrading to the real-time kernel. Anyone know what's going on?
=== Varka_ is now known as Varka
[01:41] <kakoonia> im not meaning downgrade, i tried to fix something with my laptop screen, so i did some bad adjustments.. now.. i got some bad things going on reboot and resolution got bad.. so i was wondering if theres a way to go back to a previouse state of this installation that worked fine...
[01:41] <root_> ghgf
[01:41] <stodge> Just installed Gutsy - I thought this version was supposed to have complete/easier support for configuring xorg? I'm still stuck at a refresh rate of 50Hz.
[01:42] <ztomic> Is anyone using the real-time kernel?
[01:42] <danbhfive> stodge: are you using nvidia?
[01:42] <stodge> yes
[01:42] <Jack_Sparrow> stodge: use dpkg-reconfigure and enter the refresh rates for your monitor
[01:42] <danbhfive> there is a bug in the nvidia drivers concerning refresh rates
[01:42] <thor> ToddEDM: remember...you can open several terminals so you can compare what you are doing on the desktop to what you have on the laptop (if you are so inclined)
[01:42] <stodge> compiz works a treat though with minimal work, which was nice
[01:42] <stodge> jack_sparrow: I thought that was supposed to be a thing of the past?
[01:43] <thor> ToddEDM: you can even open several ssh sessions to the desktop...although that would be redundant and repetitive
[01:43] <kakoonia> im not meaning downgrade, i tried to fix something with my laptop screen, so i did some bad adjustments.. now.. i got some bad things going on reboot and resolution got bad.. so i was wondering if theres a way to go back to a previouse state of this installation that worked fine...??
[01:43] <Galatea2> i've got a problem with networking.
[01:43] <ztomic> stodge: I have to edit my xorg.conf to get proper refresh rate.
[01:43] <Jack_Sparrow> stodge: If it dosent setup your hardware you still need to do it manually
[01:43] <ToddEDM> sorry for sounding so newbish, but what am i supposed to do on the desktop?
[01:43] <stodge> :(
[01:43] <thor> ToddEDM: nothing...you do it all from the laptop...that is the point
[01:44] <ToddEDM> yeah thats what i meant
[01:44] <Galatea2> ubuntu is NOT giving itself an ip address, even though i specifically told it to do so
[01:44] <danbhfive> stodge: the nvidia driver scrambles the refresh rate information, so if you are using the driver, the wrong refreshes will get reported
[01:44] <ToddEDM> i just wanan print a doc
[01:44] <stodge> ah ok
[01:44] <danbhfive> stodge: i have the same problem
[01:44] <thor> ToddEDM: for instance, if you type 'mkdir /home/ToddEDM/temp' it will make the directory on the desktop...not on the laptop...even though you are typing on the laptop
[01:44] <scguy318> kakoonia: oh, probably your xorg.conf
[01:44] <PeteOnline> ping
[01:44] <stodge> I have the horiz and vert values set in xorg.conf
[01:44] <Galatea2> pinging doesn't work since it doesnt have an IP
[01:44] <scguy318> kakoonia: you could try doing sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg to possibly regenerate the default config
[01:44] <Galatea2> everything is just lost
[01:44] <ToddEDM> i want print/my/damn/document
[01:44] <Galatea2> no route to host, etc
[01:44] <ToddEDM> lol
[01:45] <Hanyou> danbhfive: Well, regardless I got it to work on one machine today even if it was just luck.
[01:45] <kakoonia> scguy318

[01:45] <cyzie> ?
[01:45] <kakoonia> bahh
[01:45] <thor> ToddEDM: by the end of this evening...you can put your desktop in the closet and let it run there <smile>
[01:45] <ToddEDM> lo
[01:45] <ToddEDM> l
[01:45] <ztomic> danbhfive: I don't think it has anything to do with vid card.... I could be wrong but I don't think so.
[01:45] <tuxthepenguin533> does ubuntu have a registrey
[01:45] <scguy318> tuxthepenguin533: not really
[01:45] <ToddEDM> cyzie:  yes
[01:45] <Galatea2> tuxthepenguin533: no
[01:45] <cyzie> tuxthepenguin533, no
[01:45] <danbhfive> hanyou: yeah, I dont think i can help much more
[01:45] <Marcusklaas> God I love virtualbox
[01:45] <cyzie> ToddEDM, so setup it then, it's easy
[01:45] <scguy318> tuxthepenguin533: GConf is about the closest thing to one, and its hardly a registry
[01:45] <tuxthepenguin533> then where do configs go
[01:45] <ToddEDM> it is
[01:45] <thor> ToddEDM: when you are ready...log out of the desktop
[01:45] <Galatea2> anyone here good with networks?
[01:45] <Pici> scguy318: No. gnome uses a registry-like system called gconf, but its very organized
[01:45] <Pici> tuxthepenguin533: files
[01:45] <scguy318> kakoonia: wut
[01:46] <thor> ToddEDM: and log back in with 'ssh -X ipaddress'
[01:46] <musashi> i want to extract an osx .dmg to get at a graphics file. can i do this in ubuntu?
[01:46] <kakoonia> scguy318 is xserver-xorg a part of the command?
[01:46] <ztomic> Galatea2: just ask.
[01:46] <scguy318> Pici: I meant in the Window sense :)
[01:46] <danbhfive> hanyou: it is interesting, your pings are getting stopped at a certain spot

[01:46] <tuxthepenguin533> whats kde use then like gconf

[01:46] <Pici> tuxthepenguin533: I think it just uses files
[01:46] <Assid> heya
[01:46] <lukaszz> ok
[01:46] <Galatea2> why can't ubuntu just work?
[01:46] <scguy318> kakoonia: after doing that try restarting X
[01:46] <Hanyou> danbhfive: As I said, samn thing with the computer I am typing on right now earlier today. Then, poof, magic it works. Wierd......
[01:46] <musashi> Galatea2, it does for me
[01:47] <thor> cyzie...nothing...we got the printer working and now I am showing him how to control the desktop without having to be in front of it
[01:47] <cyzie> Galatea2, why nto ?
[01:47] <ToddEDM> cyzie:  i want to print a doc. with my desktop... im on my laptop
[01:47] <Assid> is it me,  or does compiz manage to work better with ubuntu/gnome?
[01:47] <PeteOnline> why can't windows just work?
[01:47] <tuxthepenguin533> where do the files get stored
[01:47] <Galatea2> because one moment ago
[01:47] <ToddEDM> no no thor, it hasnt printed yet
[01:47] <ztomic> ...
[01:47] <corruptionoflulz> tuxthepenguin533: everything is in your home dir
[01:47] <cyzie> thor, many ways then, ssh and vnc, rdesktop is a few ways
[01:47] <Galatea2> i was transferring files from this laptop to the computer running ubuntu
[01:47] <Galatea2> through a physical network link
[01:47] <tuxthepenguin533> ok
[01:47] <Galatea2> the next second, i return, and it refuses to connect
[01:47] <cyzie> ToddEDM, easy, 1st ssh to your desktop, do the lp command
[01:47] <thor> ToddEDM: should...you said you found the printer in cups on the laptop...so it should be in the printer menu when you print from a program
[01:47] <PeteOnline> anybody know static routing?
[01:47] <Hanyou> danbhfive: Just wish there was someone in here that knew exactly what my problem was.
[01:48] <Assid> PeteOnline: what about it?
[01:48] <PeteOnline> or a good channel to ask that same question in?
[01:48] <danbhfive> ztomic: i filed a bug report because I couldn't select a valid refresh rate, even though it was in my xorg.cong, and the guy told me it was a bug in the nvidia driver, it sounded like that guy was having the same problem, but for sure, i still cant select a refresh rate  :)
[01:48] <Galatea2> and now using ifconfig -a
[01:48] <Assid> PeteOnline: whats your question on it
[01:48] <Galatea2> my network does not contain an inet entry
[01:48] <Hanyou> PeteOnline: This channel is as good as any go.
[01:48] <PeteOnline> Assid: I've been trying to wrap my head around it basically.  To actually understand it
[01:48] <cyzie> Galatea2, dhcp ?
[01:48] <thor> ToddEDM: the ssh stuff is so you can install and config programs without having to sit in front of the computer...sorry...got ahead of the game
[01:48] <Galatea2> yes
[01:48] <ztomic> danbhfive: hmm... interesting.
[01:48] <Galatea2> "roaming mode"
[01:48] <PeteOnline> I get ip addressing and subnetting and all
[01:48] <Galatea2> and this computer is configured with a static IP
[01:48] <cyzie> Galatea2, do a networking restart
[01:49] <Assid> PeteOnline: very very simple.. think of the destiantion ip address as a destination on a map
[01:49] <ToddEDM> thor:  thats ok... that was good info
[01:49] <Galatea2> how do i do that?
[01:49] <Assid> the route itself as different routes to that location
[01:49] <cyzie> Galatea2, /etc/init.d/networking restart in root
[01:49] <AutoMatriX> just updated GPSD ... gpsdrive don't work no more
[01:49] <thor> ToddEDM: if you open the document on your laptop, when you go to print it, you should find the network printer on the drop down menu
[01:49] <ToddEDM> ok i see the printer when im printing from openoffice
[01:49] <Assid> if you hve a multi homed network, then you basically choose which netwrok you want to use to reach that destination
[01:49] <ToddEDM> yes i see it thor
[01:49] <lukaszz> hi
[01:49] <thor> ToddEDM: ok...does it print?
[01:49] <Galatea2> okay let's see now
[01:49] <lukaszz> i need help
[01:49] <ToddEDM> no, it sits in queue
[01:50] <Galatea2> nope, still not there
[01:50] <PeteOnline> I understand the idea behind static routing, but the way you enter static routes on most consumer grade routers confuses me
[01:50] <lukaszz> how to get more bright  in ubuntu  ?
[01:50] <Hanyou> PeteOnline: Go to https://help.ubuntu.com/7.10/internet/C/networking-enable.html#networking-enable-nm
[01:50] <Assid> if you wanna go to florida from newyork, then you choose a route for the whole state of florida.. and not just cape canaveral
[01:50] <thor> ToddEDM: is it in the queue on the laptop or the desktop?
[01:50] <Laney> Does anyone know why my display still suspends after 10 minutes even though I've turned it off in Screensaver and Power Management? It's quite annoying when watching videos (shouldn't video players disable this anyway?)
[01:50] <ToddEDM> haha it woulda been funny if i said YA IT PRINTS
[01:50] <thor> ToddEDM: use the 'lpq' command on both machines
[01:50] <billy> anybody have some extensive knowledge about windows?
[01:50] <Galatea2> in fact, now i can't even select the radio button in the network menu near the clock thing
[01:50] <Ongaku> rhythmbox keeps on crashing when i manually select a song...anyone know wtf is up with it?
[01:50] <Hanyou> PeteOnline: That is the Ubuntu Documentation on manual config and such.
[01:50] <Assid> PeteOnline: just read up on subnet masks.. that should easily clear it for you
[01:50] <ToddEDM> lpq: error - no default destination available.
[01:50] <AutoMatriX> anybody who uses gpsd ?
[01:50] <cyzie> Galatea2, i have never get any porblem on that
[01:51] <Galatea2> (the radio button which corresponds with my network)
[01:51] <thor> ToddEDM: was that on the desktop or the laptop?
[01:51] <Galatea2> well maybe you're lucky :(
[01:51] <jaydedrag0n_girl> billy: can i ask why you are asking about windows in the ubuntu channel?
[01:51] <ToddEDM> both
[01:51] <billy> just wondering :p
[01:51] <cyzie> Galatea2, not lucky u dumb
[01:51] <thor> ToddEDM: you can print from the desktop, right?
[01:51] <billy> cause my windows isnt booting

[01:51] <cyzie> Galatea2, cehck in network setting in /etc/
[01:51] <scott__> I am brand new to Ubuntu.  I have been running PCLinuxOS for about 9 months.  I'm having some issues with Grub.  Is this the right place to ask for help?
[01:51] <Galatea2> how so?
[01:51] <Assid> okay so, does compiz somehow work better on gnome for some stupid reason? or is that just me
[01:51] <PeteOnline> I have read up on subnet masks, how it bitwise masks the ip address to discern the network portion and the host portion, etc
[01:51] <jaydedrag0n_girl> billy: is it not in your grub menu?
[01:51] <Galatea2> you see, if i was to connect to it wirelessly though the house's router, it connects to my shared folder almost instantly
[01:52] <cyzie> Galatea2, what do YOU mean how ?
[01:52] <billy> well its in the menu
[01:52] <billy> when when i boot it
[01:52] <ToddEDM> yup... im printing a test doc right now thor
[01:52] <Galatea2> well, what do you want me to check, cyzie?
[01:52] <billy> it loads the welcome page, then restarts
[01:52] <ToddEDM> from the Desktop
[01:52] <thor> ToddEDM: from the desktop, right?
[01:52] <ToddEDM> yes
[01:52] <ztomic> no help on GNOME Settings Manager?
[01:52] <Galatea2> it's just weird how it's not the same for when you use a physical connection
[01:52] <Torahteen> Anyone here know how to use rn?
[01:52] <ztomic> I need a guru
[01:52] <thor> ToddEDM: when it is done...try printing the test document from the laptop using cups
[01:52] <jaydedrag0n_girl> billy: when you load into ubuntu and check the file directories.. is everything seemingly in order? or are your folders empty?
[01:53] <cyzie> Galatea2, go to /etc/network check the interfaces entry
[01:53] <PeteOnline> well lemme try this question: I have an ubuntu server behind a router and I want to give it an external static ip through the router
[01:53] <thor> ToddEDM: and you did add the network printer on the laptop using cups, right?
[01:53] <cyzie> Galatea2, dont enable wireless and ethernet at the same time
[01:53] <Torahteen> If I want to start reading usenet posts on a certain server, how would I set up "rn" to do this? I want to connect to news://freenews.netfront.net
[01:53] <billy> everything is still there for my windows files
[01:53]  * ^garfield2^ is away (I am Off Line Now...)

[01:53] <ztomic> PeteOnline: DMZ
[01:53] <billy> but when i boot into windows, it just restarts at welcome page
[01:53] <ToddEDM> thor the printer was there  already, i didnt manually add it ...and the test page i tried... is just sitting in queue
[01:54] <Galatea2> well i can't exactly disable wireless
[01:54] <scguy318> Ongaku: hmm, sometimes my VLC crashes when I spawn Open File dialog
[01:54] <thor> ToddEDM: from the laptop?
[01:54] <scguy318> Ongaku: coincidence?
[01:54] <Hanyou> Anyone know how to setup a Dell Laserjet to a gutsy install that is networking. I tried the Samba browser and I couldn't find it. Would manually entering it in do the trick?
[01:54] <Ongaku> scguy318: heh
[01:54] <PeteOnline> already being used for another device, and I can't seem to DMZ 2 hosts
[01:54] <Galatea2> because what else can i enable, since i can't select anything apart from wireless
[01:54] <jaydedrag0n_girl> billy: did this just happen when you installed ubuntu... or was this previously working and then stopped suddenly
[01:54] <scguy318> Ongaku: try running from terminal and see what error messages u get
=== CyberPunk is now known as nerdsquad3210
[01:54] <thor> ToddEDM: the test print you sent from the desktop worked OK, right?
[01:54] <billy> it wasnt working before i installed ubuntu
[01:54] <cyzie> Galatea2, why cant u disable wireless?
[01:55] <PeteOnline> i'm using a linksys wrt54g with dd-wrt firmware on it
[01:55] <Ongaku> scguy318: i ran this gdb thing and i got this Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[01:55] <cyzie> Galatea2, u can either disable physically or through the OS
[01:55] <netsrot> what is this "partition has been mounted several times check forced"?
[01:55] <jaydedrag0n_girl> billy: okay windows was already broken before you installed ubuntu i have this correct?
[01:55] <Galatea2> okay i'll do that
[01:55] <ztomic> PeteOnline: nope. you can't do two. but you may forward from other server or set up individual ports from the router.
[01:55] <Hanyou> billy: Then please refer to Microsoft Knowledge Base or call their customer support.
[01:55] <Galatea2> interfaces has
[01:55] <ToddEDM> thor, it ws just an emaikl i had up.. it printed fine

[01:55] <Galatea2> iface lo inet loopback
[01:55] <Galatea2> is that normal?
=== amidaniel is now known as AmiDaniel_away
[01:55] <thor> ToddEDM: ok....first let's clear the queue...on both machines type 'cancel -a' in a terminal
[01:55] <AutoMatriX> got a problem with gpsd ... can anyone help ?
[01:55] <PeteOnline> ztomic: you wouldn't happen to know why that is, would you?
[01:56] <thor> ToddEDM: you can use an ssh shell on the laptop if you like instead of going to the desktop
[01:56] <Ongaku> scguy318: segmentation fault....
[01:56] <noobynoob> is it possible to install ubuntu to fat32
[01:56] <cyzie> Galatea2, after that 2 lines, there are no anymore below ?
[01:56] <ztomic> PeteOnline: because DMZ is designed for quick and easy.
[01:56] <Galatea2> by the way, what is eth0-avah?
[01:56] <billy> Jaydedragon yeah it was broken before i installed ubuntu
[01:56] <thor> noobynoob: no
[01:56] <Galatea2> that's all there is in interface
[01:56] <noobynoob> y
[01:56] <noobynoob> y
[01:57] <Ongaku> what can i do? uninstall reinstall  or what...
[01:57] <jaydedrag0n_girl> billy: than yes you will need to find a windows channel or referr to microsoft support.. research it on google.. call a friend .. or call microsoft
[01:57] <cyzie> wrong entry Galatea2
[01:57] <khin> hi, whenever i try to do a sudo command with & it just skips over the password prompt and cancels the command, how do i do this
[01:57] <thor> ToddEDM: once you have both queues cleared...open cups on the laptop and go to the Printers tab
[01:57] <cyzie> that is why your networking fuckup
[01:57] <Galatea2> heh yeah
[01:57] <cyzie> Galatea2, what did u do ?
[01:57] <Galatea2> it's /etc/network/interface, right?
[01:57] <Galatea2> nothing
[01:57] <noobynoob> were allowed to swear
[01:57] <cyzie> Galatea2, no
[01:57] <Galatea2> as i said, i returned and then it wouldn't work
[01:57] <jaydedrag0n_girl> no not really
[01:57] <cyzie> it's /etc/network/interfaces
[01:57] <billy> oh ok
[01:58] <Galatea2> well yes that's what i meant
[01:58] <PeteOnline> ztomic: so would I be able to do the same / similar thing with static routing?
[01:58] <ToddEDM> thor:  its asking for the password on my desktop... it wont take it

[01:59] <thor> ToddEDM: your wife is a second account on the computer?
[01:59] <ztomic> PeteOnline: never tried it, but I bet it would be more difficult than setting the router to forward port ranges or specific ports.
[01:59] <Galatea2> where could a location of such file be found?
[01:59] <scott__> I have had a working install of PCLinuxOS on what would be in Windows Terms my Primary Master HD.  I wanted to try some other Linux Distros withour giving up PCLOS until I found something I like better.  When I tried to install Fedora 8 onto a new HD located as secondary slave, the Fedora installer screwed up my GRUB and computer wouldn't boot.  Fedora screws up Grub every time I've tried it.  So I wiped Fedora and i
[01:59] <scott__> nstalled Ubuntu 7.04.  Ubuntu works fine but I can't boot into my PCLOS system.  I get Error 11 Unrecognized device string.  Can anyone help me fix this please?
[01:59] <noobynoob> ! msgthebot | noobynoob
[01:59] <ToddEDM> thor:  ok that worked
[01:59] <cyzie> Galatea2, have u ask google?
[01:59] <danbhfive> Hanyou: well, hehe, I don't know,  I'm a total noob at this, but im using wireshark,     It just seemed like a next step for you
[01:59] <Galatea2> i'll do it now
[01:59] <ToddEDM> thor, yes, but i believe i gave her admin privleges
[01:59] <cyzie> Galatea2, u can type my name, so easier to see here
[02:00] <danbhfive> watch the packets from another computer
[02:00] <thor> ToddEDM: ok...clear the queue on the laptop as well...
[02:00] <ToddEDM> hold on
[02:00] <PeteOnline> ztomic: unfortunatley, the same port is going to be used on 2 different machines behind the router
[02:00] <thor> ToddEDM: then open cups in the browser on the laptop
[02:00] <Hanyou> danbhfive: I will try that, though I doubt it will help me much.
[02:00] <ztomic> PeteOnline: thats a predicament.
[02:00] <ToddEDM> hold on a sec... walmart photo just called , i gotta call my wifey
[02:00] <Galatea2> cyzie: if this interfaces file was so bankrupt of information, why was it able to accomdate my wireless card?
[02:00] <thor> ToddEDM:k
[02:00] <cyzie> Galatea2, /usr/share/doc/ppp/examples/interfaces
[02:00] <johnnybezak> anyone know if these internet problems with gutsy are being fixed - cos mine is stuffed and the ipv6 stuff doesn't help.

[02:01] <Marcusklaas> Nice I emulated Vista with virtualbox
[02:01] <cyzie> Galatea2, i have no idea how is your setup and what u going to do with it. you youself dont know what u are doing and that is dangerous
[02:01] <scguy318> Marcusklaas: no Aero tho :P
[02:01] <thor> Marcusklaas: now...can you emulate a more serious disease <smile>
[02:01] <Marcusklaas> aero = ??
[02:01] <ztomic> PeteOnline: put a switch between the modem and the router. set up the servers on the switch and the other computers on the router.
[02:01] <scguy318> Marcusklaas: the fancy Vista 3D
[02:01] <Marcusklaas> oh lol :(
[02:02] <ToddEDM> thor:  ok cups is open on the laptop
[02:02] <scguy318> Marcusklaas: 3D typically doesn't work on VMs, hard to virtualize
[02:02] <ToddEDM> test page , no working
[02:02] <thor> ToddEDM: ok...on the Printers tab....
[02:02] <scguy318> Marcusklaas: VMware is the only thing that has basically beta support
[02:02] <Csaba> i need some help getting trash can and showdesktop on avant dock, anyone??
[02:02] <Hanyou> This is honestly about to make me cry.
[02:02] <ToddEDM> ok
[02:02] <Marcusklaas> i heard there's a very lean version of ubuntu of vmware integrated .. liek 300 MBs big
[02:02] <thor> set printer options
[02:02] <ToddEDM> ok
[02:02] <thor> ToddEDM: make sure they are ok
[02:03] <cyzie> thor, how do u know if ToddEDM know how to make sure? he is newbie
[02:03] <ToddEDM> controlled by printout mode....
[02:03] <thor> cyzie...they are page length and such...would be specific to his setup
[02:04] <PeteOnline> ztomic: I was thinking of doing that, but I also need to use it locally, inside the router
[02:04] <ToddEDM> it all looks good thor
[02:04] <ToddEDM> error policy is retry-job
[02:04] <tuxthepenguin533> !logs
[02:04] <thor> ToddEDM: on the printers tab also check the line 'Printer State' it should say 'idle, accepting jobs'

[02:04] <Grav3Mind> can anyone recommend a good screen video capture program for ubuntu?
[02:04] <Marcusklaas> hey scguy318: can i do the glassy window look tho?
[02:04] <ztomic> PeteOnline: that's where you're gonna have to set up static routing and I don't know how.
[02:04] <cyzie> Marcusklaas, yes
[02:04] <thor> cyzie...they aren;t real important right now...would just mess up the format
[02:04] <Marcusklaas> ah cool
[02:04] <Marcusklaas> where can i configure that?
[02:04] <thor> cyzie...I wanted him to know they are there
[02:04] <PeteOnline> in interfaces?
[02:05] <Galatea2> right.
[02:05] <cyzie> thor, hehe. yes, show the kiddie
[02:05] <ToddEDM> yes also it says published thor
[02:05] <robdig> Grav3Mind: applications->accessories->take screen shot
[02:05] <thor> ToddEDM: good...then it should be working. When you click on Print Test Page does it give an error?
[02:05] <Grav3Mind> VIDEO
[02:05] <Grav3Mind> not screen shot
[02:05] <PeteOnline> ztomic: i have that figured out, my question is more on the router's side, which I realise isn't really this channel's purpose
[02:05] <robdig> Grav3Mind: ah...you did say video, my apologies...don't know there
[02:06] <ToddEDM> ok i see something i idnt notice before, which i shoulda, its in big bold type ....Unable to connect to CIFS host, will retry in 60 seconds...
[02:06] <Grav3Mind> lol sorry robdig....
[02:06] <thor> ToddEDM: really...that means it can't get to the desktop...are you running firewalls?
[02:06] <cyzie> Galatea2, good to go now ?
[02:06] <kn4rF> it's possible to run keyboard events from bash terminal?
[02:06] <ztomic> PeteOnline: yeah, i hear you. I'v never done it. probably set your servers up to receive from IP and the router to static route to an ip. I dunno.
[02:06] <thor> ToddEDM:...wait...check this....
[02:07] <ToddEDM> thor, maybe on my router
[02:07] <thor> ToddEDM: on the printers tab...click on Modify Printer
[02:07] <Galatea2> nope
[02:07] <Galatea2> is it possible
[02:07] <cyzie> Galatea2, ?
[02:07] <Galatea2> that i just add my own entry
[02:07] <thor> ToddEDM: no...the router would only be firewalled to the internet
[02:07] <kn4rF> Galatea2, how?
[02:07] <cyzie> Galatea2, yes

[02:07] <ArthurArchnix> I'm looking at an emacs interface for the first time because i want to learn to use 'r' and I'm told ESS (emacs speaks statistics) is the way to go, but I am really displeased with the display. It looks bad, like what gnucash looked like in Feisty. Any ideas on improving font rendering, at the very least?
[02:07] <thor> ToddEDM:click on Modify Printer, then Click on Continue...
[02:07] <PeteOnline> ztomic: yeah, I think we both have the same level of knowledge on this, neither of us know how to do static routing on the router.  blind leading the blind and all
[02:07] <Grav3Mind> anyone know of a good VIDEO screen capture program
[02:08] <Galatea2> like, i'd just write iface eth0 inet static
[02:08] <ztomic> hehe
[02:08] <mark_> whats a good lightweight Mplayer GUI?
[02:08] <Galatea2> this shouldnt be happening though
[02:08] <ToddEDM> thor ok
[02:08] <Galatea2> ubuntu is just meant to work without a hitch
[02:08] <Marcusklaas> and it does
[02:08] <cyzie> Galatea2, yes, then u need to insert the ip ssubnet mask and gw
[02:08] <thor> ToddEDM: Make sure the device is right...I think it should be AppSocket/HP Direct
[02:08] <Galatea2> yeah
[02:08] <stodge> Any ideas what I'm missing:  undefined reference to `XPending'

[02:08] <ToddEDM> thor:  it was windows printer via samba
[02:09] <ToddEDM> i changed it
[02:09] <cyzie> Galatea2, yes, ubuntu work out of the box unless u go mess it up and that u dont know what u are doin

[02:09] <vee_> thanx
[02:09] <ToddEDM> ok np
[02:09] <vee_> first involves RAID 1

[02:09] <thor> ToddEDM: I am running a Canon iP90 on ubuntu and that is what I needed for my laptop
[02:09] <Galatea2> well i didn't touch anything at all!
[02:09] <kelsin> ArthurArchnix: you can install emacs 23 from http://peadrop.com/blog/2007/01/06/pretty-emacs/
[02:10] <vee_> I was hoping this would make things easier.
[02:10] <Galatea2> this is frustrating. ubuntu isn't meant to destroy the network after i leave for a few minutes
[02:10] <thor> ToddEDM: once you have it changed (try the AppSocket) click continue and see if the device url is OK
[02:10] <vee_> When I went to install 7.10 - it saw two disks instead of 1
[02:10] <thor> ToddEDM: oops...hold on
[02:10] <vee_> So I choose the first

[02:10] <Hanyou> How do you go about disabling a piece of hardware in your system?
[02:10] <ztomic> PeteOnline: you may be able to install extra nic's on the servers and connect them to the router but that defeats the purpose of wide area network.
[02:10] <scott__> Can anyone help me with my GRUB issue, or point me to a GRUB support channel please?
[02:11] <cyzie> Galatea2, no it wont, i been running ubuntu like >100 days, no problem on my networking
[02:11] <ArthurArchnix> kelsin: Beauty. Thanks.
[02:11] <PeteOnline> I wasn't really expecting anyone here to know static routing, I was more hoping someone knew a good irc channel I could go bug
[02:11] <IndyGunFreak> scott__: whats your issue?
[02:11] <thor> ToddEDM: no...it should be Windows/Samba...I was looking at the wrong machine...sorry
[02:11] <Galatea2> but why am i the unfortunate one?
[02:11] <ztomic> extra cost too but nics are cheap
[02:11] <vee_> installation said it was finished and now- I have the reboot and selct proper Boot Device...message
[02:11] <cyzie> if u are not the one who is change it, then have u look into other possiblity?
[02:11] <thor> ToddEDM: on the next page you should see the device url
[02:11] <vee_> what did I do wrong?
[02:11] <cyzie> like software that change it ?
[02:11] <PeteOnline> yeah, i might just do that in the end, but static routing through the router and locking down that specific ip address would be best
[02:11] <ToddEDM> ok
[02:11] <brian994> DCC SEND "itsabeautifuldaythesunisshiningifeelgoodnobodyisgoingtoletmedown" 0 0 0 0 0
[02:12] <neko> nobody have an idea ?
[02:12] <danbhfive> PeteOnline, don't the linksys routers have good config software, which handles all that?
[02:12] <thor> make sure the device url is something like...'smb://192.168.1.xxx/name' where name is the name of the printer
[02:12] <scott__> I had PCLOS on my primary HD.  I added another HD and installed ubuntu.  Ubuntu works but i can't boot into my PCLOS.  I get Error 11 unrecognized device string
[02:12] <ToddEDM> thor smb://MSHOME/PC-HOME/printer
[02:12] <ToddEDM> hmmmm
[02:12] <Galatea2> why does eth0 broadcast an ipv6 address, but not an ipv4?
[02:12] <thor> ToddEDM: nope...your desktop is linux, right?
[02:12] <PeteOnline> danbhfive: I'm using dd-wrt, custom firmware installed on a linksys
[02:12] <IndyGunFreak> scott__: when grub loads, i presume its when you boot your ubuntu drive first, right?
[02:12] <ToddEDM> yeah!!
[02:12] <danbhfive> i see
[02:12] <ToddEDM> usd to be windows
[02:12] <Galatea2> and what's the difference between eth0 and eth0:avah
[02:13] <kelsin> ArthurArchnix: you can install the emacs-snapshot-gtk official package just to get gtk widgets, but that package from that blog also includes nice XFT font support
[02:13] <scott__> The working Grub is on the new hard drive
[02:13] <cyzie> Galatea2, fix yoru problem first.
[02:13] <thor> ToddEDM: is the desktop named MSHOME?
[02:13] <plamo> Query: Gparted doesn't let me unmount my /dev/sda1 hard drive because other things are mounted to the same point, how do I get it so I can unmount it?
[02:13] <ToddEDM> thor: no
[02:13] <cyzie> Galatea2,  u are running away from your own problem
[02:13] <ToddEDM> its wrong
[02:13] <Galatea2> well i've tried everything including setting my network to DHCP inside interfaces
[02:13] <thor> ToddEDM: right...you need to change that...smb://ipaddress/name
[02:13] <scott__> I boot up and I get a grub menu to choose my OS.  Ubuntu and PCLOS are both on the list
[02:13] <thor> ToddEDM: ipaddress is the ipaddress of the desktop, and name is the name you put into Samba on the desktop
[02:13] <IndyGunFreak> scott__: ok, can you browse the old drive, and look at the grub menu config?  IF so, it will tell you what parameters it was using, and you can just set those perameters inside Ubuntu's grub menu.lst,
[02:13] <Galatea2> I am literally lost for ideas
[02:14] <danbhfive> vee_ i have no idea, but, I'm gona send you a webpage
[02:14] <vee_> ok
[02:14] <danbhfive> !raid > vee_
[02:14] <thor> ToddEDM: sorry about this...I am usually better <smile>
[02:14] <scott__> ok.  I'll try that.  Thanks.
[02:14] <ToddEDM> hey thhis is great thor thanks
[02:14] <ztomic> PeteOnline: try some other channels... these guys are pretty specific in here. If it aint ubuntu, they don't know.
[02:14] <ToddEDM> ok the mane i put in samba.......
[02:14] <ToddEDM> name
[02:14] <Galatea2> okay
[02:14] <Galatea2> this is strange
[02:14] <thor> ToddEDM: once you have the url set, click continue
[02:14] <Galatea2> interfaces is now devoid of the entry i put in, and saved
[02:15] <thor> ToddEDM:choose the printer and click continue
[02:15] <vee_> yes- i went to that site already -- doesnt cover 71.0
[02:15] <ToddEDM> i dont know thqat name i put in samba
[02:15] <vee_> 71.0
[02:15] <ztomic> or just don't care
[02:15] <PeteOnline> ztomic: I tried networking, but it was like talking to a room full of statues
[02:15] <Galatea2> that definitely isn't normal.
[02:15] <thor> ToddEDM: you should use the same driver you are using on the desktop
[02:15] <vee_> danbhfive: is RAID a bad idea?
[02:15] <Hanyou> danbhfive: Do you know how to disable a piece of hardware on gutsy? I have been looking in support docs and haven't found crap.
[02:15] <scott__> When I open menu.1st it opens read only.  Who do I get it to open as a read write?
[02:15] <pabix> Hello.. in which file should I define my EDITOR variable?
[02:16] <scguy318> scott___: gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:16] <ToddEDM> thor:  gimme an example of yours
[02:16] <pabix> scott__, sudo ?
[02:16] <neko> how do i set off definitvly the bell ?
[02:16] <neko> it beep on my computer
[02:16] <scott__> thanks.  I was opening from GUI
[02:16] <neko> and it is annoying
[02:16] <pabix> neko, System>Preferences>Sound ?
[02:16] <thor> ToddEDM: my printer is a canon pixma ip90...I use the driver for the iP2000 since there isn't one for the ip90
[02:16] <neko> cool
[02:17] <ToddEDM> oops i was meaning the Dvice U
[02:17] <ToddEDM> RL
[02:17] <neko> thanks pabix
[02:17] <ToddEDM> URI
[02:17] <Galatea2> it seems as if ubuntu doesn't want me to network the two computers together
[02:17] <pabix> neko, welcome
[02:17] <thor> oh...my device url is smb://192.168.0.xx/iP90
[02:17] <Assid> anyone here got avalaunch working?
[02:17] <thor> ToddEDM: in samba on the server I called the printer iP90
[02:18] <danbhfive> vee_ i dunno, it sounds like a pain  :)
[02:18] <ste-foy> \\|//
[02:18] <ste-foy> {ö/ö}
[02:18] <Galatea2> anyone with another idea?
[02:18] <thor> ToddEDM: just curious...did you install swat with samba?
[02:18] <danbhfive> hanyou: no i don't, im google'ing, have you tried ifdown?
[02:18] <ToddEDM> thor:  no
[02:18] <thor> ToddEDM: do yourself a favour...install swat
[02:19] <neko> galatea2
[02:19] <vee_> danbhfive: so whast the best way to set up Linux so that it mirrors certain info two a second internal HD
[02:19] <neko> you want to make samba network with them ?
[02:19] <ToddEDM> hold on , im trying to figure out my URI
[02:19] <Galatea2> yes
[02:19] <Galatea2> i've done that
[02:19] <Galatea2> and i've transferred files between the two computers on several occasions
[02:19] <neko> how the two computer get their IP ?
[02:20] <neko> oh it have work in the past but no more now ?
[02:20] <Galatea2> this computer has an ip set up of 192.168.2.1
[02:20] <Galatea2> yes
[02:20] <Assid> man the live cd should use anti aliasing
[02:20] <neko> the other one ?
[02:20] <Galatea2> and the other connects via "roaming mode"
[02:20] <Assid> anyone know where i can change this setting?
[02:20] <Assid> the fonts look too crappy
[02:20] <neko> check with ifconfig it they are in the same network
[02:20] <Galatea2> which worked extremely well until an hour ago
[02:21] <Galatea2> eth0 is not assigned an ip
[02:21] <Galatea2> there's something ghostly called eth0:avah
[02:21] <neko> okey 1 have an ip the other have none
[02:21] <Jack_Sparrow> ToddEDM: I used this link...  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=282096
[02:21] <Galatea2> which has an IP, but exists on a different subnet
[02:21] <K_Dallas> Sorry to ask this but where could i find a background/wallpaper which is pretty representative of ubuntu's spirit? (something like the picture on the CD jackets). Need this for a presentation, thank you
[02:22] <Jack_Sparrow> K_Dallas: gnome-look.org
[02:22] <Galatea2> K_Dallas: try google images
[02:22] <K_Dallas> thank you both
[02:22] <thor> ToddEDM: if you can't figure out the printer name....you can find it easy wth swat
[02:22] <danbhfive> hanyou: for network devices, it looks like you could just use the gui under System > Administration > Network
[02:22] <K_Dallas> Galatea2, google images is frustrating, most of the time
[02:22] <ToddEDM> ok
[02:22] <neko> okey so your main problem is that one of your computer is no more in your network ?
[02:22] <Galatea2> i decided to insult ubuntu by placing the leopard-beta "grass" desktop
[02:22] <cvd> its there away to to open with wine a .exe after double-click and not right-click open with wine? this what appear when i do a double-click .exe http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/5f8c9bb26f.png
[02:22] <Galatea2> yes, that's the problem neko
[02:23] <Galatea2> they're not "communicating" with each other
[02:23] <Assid> anyone?
[02:23] <sfears> why is fileserver trying to send me Fedora 8 so badly?
[02:23] <kelsin> K_Dallas: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Official that can help, not backgrounds, but logos and stuff
[02:23] <neko> first you really need to have your two computer in the same network
[02:23] <K_Dallas> thanks kelsin
[02:23] <neko> what the problem with the one that get no IP ?
[02:23] <danbhfive> vee_: sorry, i have never done raid myself, i personally just backup as i need to, but its really not that secure the way i do it
[02:24] <Galatea2> the problem is it's running ubuntu
[02:24] <sfears> problem indeed
[02:24] <thor> ToddEDM: the other way to find the printer name is to look in the samba config file...but since I discovered swat I have never looked there...so don't even remember where to find it
[02:24] <danbhfive> vee_: in fact, i don't know much about backing up in ubuntu
[02:24] <Assid> how do i change the anti aliasing of the screen?
[02:24] <neko> I know only two way to assign IP
[02:24] <Galatea2> Assid: go to system>preference>appearance>fonts
[02:24] <neko> by hand
[02:24] <ToddEDM> ok i got swat... how do i open it
[02:24] <Galatea2> yeah, by hand it doesn't work
[02:24] <neko> or with a dhcp
[02:24] <Galatea2> and that doesn't work either
[02:24] <danbhfive> vee_: I did move /home to a certain partition, which is kinda a backup proceedure
[02:24] <sfears> in appearance prefs Assid? under fonts
[02:24] <thor> ToddEDM: you installed swat on the desktop, right?
[02:25] <Jack_Sparrow> cvd: Have you looked at thunar file manager...
[02:25] <Galatea2> something went bad with /etc/network/interface
[02:25] <ToddEDM> both
[02:25] <neko> the net interface is  wifi  ?
[02:25] <Galatea2> and I have no idea how to fix it
[02:25] <neko> on the computer that have the problem
[02:25] <Galatea2> no, its with a physical hardware link
[02:25] <thor> ToddEDM: ok..on the laptop open a browser tab and for an address type 'ipaddress:901' the ipaddress of the desktop
[02:25] <cvd> thunar?
[02:25] <Assid> thanks
[02:25] <Galatea2> they're both connected though car5
[02:25] <Galatea2> cat5*
[02:25] <Galatea2> through*
[02:25] <Jack_Sparrow> cvd: Yes, like nautilus, but smaller and lighter
[02:25] <Galatea2> wifi works great
[02:25] <vee_> danbhfive: if it means avoiding headaches and trying to get thing to work right, I can have just two HDs and some sort of app that backs up when asked - does this sound like the better way to do it?
[02:26] <Galatea2> but its slow and the packet loss is substantial because the computer is in the backyard
[02:26] <sfears> you have a computer in the backyard too?
[02:26] <thor> ToddEDM: did swat open or do we need to restart xinetd again?
[02:26] <Jack_Sparrow> vee_: one line in a cli will backup for you
[02:26] <Galatea2> yeah
[02:26] <cvd> i like gnome, .exe worked before, but now i dont know what happend i wont open with wine automatically
[02:26] <ToddEDM> restart
[02:26] <Galatea2> i use it for timemachine and what not
[02:26] <vee_> Jack_Sparrow: please enlighten me!
[02:26] <sfears> just playin...
[02:26] <thor> ToddEDM: sudo /usr/sbin/xinetd restart
[02:27] <Jack_Sparrow> vee_: you can install thunar with synaptic, aptitude or apt-get
[02:27] <danbhfive> vee_: well, as a fellow noob to this stuff, yes  :P
[02:27] <Galatea2> its actually my old computer which i gave to my rents because apparently ubuntu is easy to use
[02:27] <thor> ToddEDM: on the desktop
[02:27] <thor> ToddEDM: then refresh the browser page and see if swat loads (I hope)
[02:27] <danbhfive> vee_: i mean, if it aint working, and you can live without it, why bother, this is just MHO
[02:27] <Galatea2> but, upon reflection, it's starting to be (un) good
[02:28] <vee_> danbhfive: completely new to this stuff and want to make it easy yet efficient
[02:28] <Galatea2> okay, i may as well transfer files though the sneakernet
[02:28] <ToddEDM> :( nope thor
[02:28] <Galatea2> this is ridiculous
[02:28] <Galatea2> thanks, bye.
[02:28] <neko> ?
[02:28] <danbhfive> vee_: yeah, if you are new, i would say, forget raid for now
[02:28] <thor> ToddEDM: ok...you will have to take a look at the samba config. Research swat on ubuntu later...it is worth the trouble
[02:28] <vee_> danbhfive: i hear ya - just need the machine to serve as a LAMP and file server
[02:29] <thor> ToddEDM: let me see if I can find the samba config
[02:29] <lashmoove> whats the equivalent command to use in ubuntu to chkdsk.. in windows i would "chkdsk g: /f" to fix a currupt drive.. but, how to do that in ubuntu ?
[02:29] <Jack_Sparrow> vee_: raid is not worth the effort...
[02:29] <danbhfive> vee_: i think raid is something thats a bit involved to setup, ie, get linux to recognize it on bootup
[02:29] <vee_> Jack_Sparrow: whats that line you mentioned or app?
[02:29] <neko> fsck
[02:29] <peacho> I need help getting Internet Time working right in Ubuntu 7.10. Can anyone help me?
[02:29] <neko> lashmoove
[02:29] <Jack_Sparrow> vee_: thunar file manager...  install with synaptic or apt-get or aptitude
[02:30] <vee_> danbhfive: yea, at the moment I installed the server addition and now it wont boot at all from the HD
[02:30] <soldats> thunar us a really great file manager
[02:30] <netsrot> how do I turn off updatedb autorunning?
[02:30] <thor> ToddEDM: ok.../etc/samba/smb.conf
[02:30] <robdig> peacho: whats going on?
[02:30] <thor> ToddEDM: on the desktop...in a terminal type 'less /etc/samba/smb.conf'
[02:30] <user_> how to check size of /home/user/  ? i want to do backup of it
[02:30] <|muelli|> hm netsrot. good question. I'd look in /etc/cron.d/
[02:30] <thor> ToddEDM: you familiar with 'less'?
[02:30] <vee_> Jack_Sparrow thanx so much
[02:30] <Jack_Sparrow> np
[02:31] <ToddEDM> haha not at all thor
[02:31] <|muelli|> user_: try a "du -hs" in your directory
=== |muelli| is now known as Muelli
[02:31] <peacho> When I open Time and Date Settings and change Configuration from Manual to "Keep Synchronized with Internet Servers" it tells me I must install NTP support.
[02:31] <danbhfive> netstrot: System > Preferences > Sessions
[02:31] <thor> ToddEDM: it just lets you see the file...not edit it. Page down by hitting the spacebar, and back with the 'b' key
[02:31] <user_> thanks
[02:31] <ToddEDM> k
[02:32] <thor> ToddEDM: look for the definition for the shared printer...the name you need is the name on the left side in square brackets [iP90]
[02:32] <neko> user_ you can also
[02:32] <peacho> If I click Install, it sits there for a little while and then it doesn't seem to fix anything.
[02:32] <neko> right click on nautilus
[02:32] <vee_> danbhfive: what did you pick (when installing) when it came to partioning? I think I am going to reinstall after I tell the BIOS to stop the RAID 1 and switch them both to act like IDE
[02:32] <ArthurArchnix> kelsin: You know what it was? your second comment there started me looking through synaptic. The thing is I wanted ess, but when I selected that it installed emacs 21 as the dependency. Emacs 22's font rendering is fine, and is also available in the repository. As is the snapshots you mentioned. Now to see if ess is working with 22, and then if I can uninstall 21 without apt also removing ess. Sigh... :)
[02:32] <user_> neko,  yes?
[02:32] <robdig> peacho: yes, you need NTP to sync. you can get it by typing in a terminal apt-get install ntp
[02:32] <thor> ToddEDM: there should be a line in that section with the 'printer name='
[02:32] <neko> for check a size of a folder
[02:33] <kelsin> ArthurArchnix: yeah it can be slightly odd, but even if you have to remove all then install the snapshot package first, then the ess package you should be ok
[02:33] <Assid> hrmm.. stupid network isnt going on wifi
[02:33] <Assid> not in live cd mode atleast
[02:33] <neko> the right click > properties
[02:33] <neko> give you this info also
[02:33] <neko> in nautilus
[02:33] <ArthurArchnix> kelsin: Indeed. Well, thanks for the tips and such.
[02:33] <kelsin> ArthurArchnix: np
[02:34] <f3d> Allo
[02:34] <danbhfive> vee_ well, I have 3 partitions i believe, swap, /home, and /
[02:34] <danbhfive> vee_ i use this as a desktop, and a hobby developement server with apache/php
[02:34] <ToddEDM> i see [printers] and [print$] thor
[02:35] <user_> i got problem with printing on ubuntu, the shared printer is on windows xp sp2, so sometime after print a lot of pages, then i can not do print, it's like the ubuntu not send print job to the XP, even i already restart the CUPS service (/etc/init.d/cupsys restart) the printer still no respond. Why that happen?
[02:35] <thor> ToddEDM: right and you should also see a section where you defined the printer for sharing
[02:35] <user_> should i upgrade my feisty (7.04) to 7.10 to solve this problem ?
[02:35] <user_> neko,  thanks
[02:35] <ToddEDM> hold on
[02:35] <thor> ToddEDM it may be you never added the printer?
[02:36] <vee_> danbhfive: so new that im not sure what the difference is between the three . I have 2 SATA 500 Gb HDDs
[02:36] <ToddEDM2> ok thor, im on the desktop
[02:36] <user_> does anyone here ever got same problem like me ? or you guys, have no problem with it
[02:37] <peacho> robdig: when I try to install this I get the following error: Package ntp is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[02:37] <peacho> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[02:37] <peacho> is only available from another source
[02:37] <peacho> E: Package ntp has no installation candidate
[02:37] <vee_> danbhfive: i imagine home/ is for the OS
[02:37] <thor> ToddEDM right...and looking at the smb.conf file, right?
[02:37] <LiMaO> user_: what problem are you having?
[02:37] <danbhfive> vee_ /home is for the user
[02:37] <vee_> danbhfive: not sure what swap is
[02:37] <danbhfive> vee_ whats this for?
[02:37] <robdig> peacho: let me double check the name...
[02:37] <danbhfive> vee_ how much ram do you have?
[02:37] <ToddEDM> etc/samba/smb.conf
[02:37] <peacho> ok
[02:37] <user_> LiMaO, sometime i can not print document to shared printer on xp :(
[02:37] <vee_> danbhfive: Remote and LAN file server and a LAMP test box
[02:37] <thor> ToddEDM right. And you didn't edit this file at all, right?
[02:38] <danbhfive> ok
[02:38] <danbhfive> ram?
[02:38] <user_> i just wonder does cups or smbfs have problem about stability connecting to windows xp shared printer
[02:38] <vee_> 4 gigs
[02:38] <user_> is there any issue about this?
[02:38] <ToddEDM2> thor:  im logged on as myself on the desktop right now... and i cant even get to lok at smb.conf
[02:39] <danbhfive> vee_ ok, forget about swap i think
[02:39] <thor> ToddEDM you probably need to do an 'sudo less /etc/samba/smb.conf'
[02:39] <vee_> danbhfive: 2 ghz core 2 duo
[02:39] <danbhfive> vee_ especially if its only you using it
[02:39] <vee_> danbhfive: swap is like using HD for RAM?
[02:39] <danbhfive> you will never need swap
[02:39] <danbhfive> ya
[02:39] <vee_> kewl
[02:39] <vee_> im sure i have to assign some space to it, right?
[02:40] <danbhfive> no
[02:40] <robdig> peacho: yup, ntp is the package name. you might need to check that your sources are correct...system->administration->software sources and make sure all of the repositories are checked
[02:40] <thor> ToddEDM did that work?
[02:40] <user_> is there any software to restore deleted file on ubuntu ?
[02:40] <ToddEDM2>  CUPS printing.  See also the cupsaddsmb(8) manpage in the
[02:40] <ToddEDM2> # cupsys-client package.
[02:40] <ToddEDM2> ;   printing = cups
[02:40] <ToddEDM2> ;   printcap name = cups
[02:41] <jakomo> oijojoijoij
[02:41] <vee_> danbhfive: I am going to erase my RAID and begin reinstalling, whe I get to partioning, I am going to ask what I should do - is that ok?
[02:41] <thor> ToddEDM I don't think that will work...but try using the name cups in the url on the laptop
[02:41] <Cabbage> Under Gutsy, mplayer when using xv only shows green when playing videos. X11 is too slow to really use as an alternative. Ideas?
[02:42] <thor> ToddEDM you remember where that is?
[02:42] <peacho> @robdig: Okay, so I'm on the Software Sources page and the only thing I see checked on the Ubuntu Software tabbed is Installable from CD/DVD. I take it I want to check all the "Downloadable from the Internet" boxes?
[02:42] <danbhfive> vee_ I think there is an option to have ubuntu figure out the partitioning for you
[02:42] <danbhfive> vee_ might as well start there
[02:42] <reallyjoel> is it possible to change my screen resolution to something custom thats not listed in the app for screen res.
[02:42] <danbhfive> vee_ you can change it later with gparted, and not loose your information
[02:42] <ToddEDM> on the cups page on the browser
[02:42] <ToddEDM> ?
[02:42] <ToddEDM> ?
[02:42] <robdig> peacho: yup
[02:42] <thor> right
[02:42] <keen101> is there a way to "steal" the window manager from kde?
[02:43] <wday> Hello I tried searching forums but couldn't find an answer - I installed vim-latexsuite using apt-get, but when I open a .tex file with gvim it doesn't load latexsuite
[02:43] <vee_> danbhfive: yes, the first option. going to erase the RAID 1 and resey the HDs to function as IDEs first
[02:43] <Assid> dont get why linux always uses only 60 hz for its screens for lcd's
[02:43] <Assid> and not 72/75 if the hardware supports it
[02:43] <danbhfive> vee_ yeah, in the bios
[02:44] <danbhfive> user_ you could try e2undel
[02:44] <mEck0> I thinking of buying a new soundcard. I've read that some people recommend m-audio and other brands instead of Creative's soundcards, because they says they have better sound quality and so on. I want it to give me very nice and clear sound for music listening, in movies and games. kind of an allround-card. is it a creative card I should buy?
[02:44] <peacho> I guess that explains why I couldn't install programs from Add/Remove Programs either!
[02:44] <Assid> anyone here using X and have configured it to use 72/75hz for the video instead of 60 for LCD's ?
[02:44] <loca|host> !alsa
[02:44] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[02:44] <loca|host> !sound
[02:44] <robdig> peacho: probably so
[02:44] <LiMaO> Assid: i may use 75hz if i want
[02:44] <danbhfive> Assid are you sure your lcd can go that high?
[02:44] <keen101> can the window manager be used in gnome? (ie.  different wallpaper for each desktop)
[02:44] <Assid> LiMaO: yeah it used to on win
[02:45] <reallyjoel> The Screen Resolution app in system->preferences (in gnome) doesnt list the correct resolutions for my screen (its widescreen), so can i set it in another way?
[02:45] <keen101> (from kde)
[02:45] <danbhfive> Assid are you using nvidia?
[02:45] <LiMaO> Assid: i mean it works for me under linux
[02:45] <Assid> dont remember if it was 72/75
[02:45] <Peppery> Hi, I'm running Apache 2 on Ubuntu Server 7.10 and I'm having problems trying to get it to execute cgi/perl scripts. I had this problem before and fixed it somehow. Does anyone know how I can fix it?
[02:45] <Assid> danbhfive: nah, ati radeon 9000 mobility
[02:45] <LiMaO> Assid: have you properly configured your monitor horizontal and vertical frequency ranges in xorg.conf ?
[02:45] <Assid> its a dell d600 latptop
[02:45] <danbhfive> reallyjoel are you using an nvidia?
[02:45] <Assid> LiMaO: just reinstalling (changing from kubuntu to ubuntu)
[02:46] <reallyjoel> danbhfive, yes, 6800gt
[02:46] <LiMaO> Assid: also, if you go to System > Preferences > Screen Resolution, can't you change it there?
[02:46] <Assid> LiMaO: live cd shows me only 60hz
[02:46] <LiMaO> Assid: mine shows 50hz and 51hz.. if i choose 50, it'll work at 60hz, if i choose 51 it'll work at 75hz
[02:46] <ThePirateRedBear> I was wondering just yesterday if there would ever be a day that I will be so smart that I can edit xorg.conf  and know what I'm doing.
[02:47] <thor> ToddEDM I once told a friend that I liked linux because it allows one to rediscover the joy of getting a printer to print 'hello'
[02:47] <ToddEDM2> thor i dont know wtf is wrong with this
[02:47] <keen101> LiMaO, try using the alternate install CD.
[02:47] <Assid> hrmm no such thing here
[02:47] <danbhfive> reallyjoel the nvidia drivers have a bug which scrambles the refresh rate listings, that might be your problem
[02:47] <LiMaO> keen101: uh? i don't need it. i have a working system =P
[02:47] <thor> ToddEDM2:whats the matter? won't it take cups?
[02:47] <danbhfive> anyone know how to make a suggestion for ubotu?
[02:47] <peacho> robdig: It's installing now... :)
[02:47] <keen101> oh. well, it gives you more options...
[02:48] <ToddEDM> its not doin anything
[02:48] <reallyjoel> danbhfive, well if that bug spills over to screen resolutions, but the refresh rate works fine
[02:48] <Peppery> anyone?
[02:48] <robdig> peacho: excellent
[02:48] <danbhfive> no, i think its just refresh rates
[02:48] <reallyjoel> danbhfive, SHOULD 'Screen Resolution' app list widescreen res's?
[02:48] <thor> ToddEDM here's the thing...you have almost everything right...but you don't have th eprinter shared via samba yet...that is where swat comes in. If you aren't too discouraged I can help you get that...we are close <smile>
[02:48] <Assid> reallyjoel: it should honestluy
[02:49] <Assid> widescreen is getting to be a norm now
[02:49] <peacho> robdig; It just finished and now works fine. Thanks for your help.
[02:49] <robdig> peacho: no prob, have a great evening
[02:49] <reallyjoel> I mean, not should as in usability, but as in how its made currently
[02:49] <thor> ToddEDM I am looking at this howto....http://linuxtnt.wordpress.com/2007/08/12/starting-swat-on-ubuntu/
[02:49] <blackvd> I have a quick question here, when i use nvidia-settings to switch my screen from my laptop to my TV, How do I switch it back without restarting X?
[02:49] <danbhfive> reallyjoel are you switching monitors by chance?
[02:49] <ToddEDM> i am very discouraged ... lemme have a look
[02:49] <thor> ToddEDM2: you need to install one more thing according to that....
[02:50] <wday> If anyone else has this problem, it's a known bug see bug #137205
[02:50] <thor> ToddEDM2: do 'sudo apt-get install netkit-inetd' on the desktop
[02:50] <reallyjoel> danbhfive, well yeah, but i switched gpu at the same time, from ati to nvidia, required an install of nvidia drivers and a reboot
[02:50] <ubuntu> hello
[02:50] <danbhfive> reallyjoel anyway, you can use the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-org
[02:50] <reallyjoel> used the proprietary drivers app for that
[02:51] <danbhfive> reallyjoel yeah, you need to reconfigure every time you switch monitors
[02:51] <reallyjoel> danbhfive, is it scary?
[02:51] <danbhfive> i believe
[02:51] <ubuntu> do you spanish
[02:51] <thor> ToddEDM2: according to the howto that should enable swat
[02:51] <danbhfive> reallyjoel not if you know the specs of your monitor, which it sounds like you do
[02:51] <thor> ToddEDM2: my fault...I thought it was part of xinetd
[02:51] <ubuntu> help
[02:52] <thor> ToddEDM2: when we get swat running...it will make samba a snap to configure

[02:54] <reallyjoel> danbhfive, hmm?
[02:54] <TigranG> Hey. I read somewhere about how Network Manager isnt that good, and there was an alternative. I forgot what the name was. IF anyone knows what I'm talking about, can you please tell me the name
[02:55] <thor> ToddEDM2: just checking in my ubuntu  I don't see netkit-inetd
[02:56] <ToddEDM2> ok i did sudo apt-get install swat
[02:56] <djezer> help, I lost my taskbar
[02:56] <ToddEDM2> got it on both laptop and desktop
[02:56] <thor> ToddEDM2: ok...hang on a sec while I check for a better howto
[02:56] <thor> ToddEDM2: ok...I was right...it is xinetd...check this url....https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Swat
[02:57] <blkthndr> is there any way i can change the status of a hidden directory (windows hidden directory) in ubuntu?
[02:58] <electron> su -
[02:58] <thor> ToddEDM2: the line about restarting xinetd is outdated though...it is /usr/sbin/xinetd
[02:58] <robdig> djezer: do you still have one of them?
[02:58] <electron> n=eldt
[02:58] <electron> 190.154.56.58
[02:58] <Taa5i> Hello.  I'm attempting to install using a Xircom rbem56g cardbus ethernet adapter and network autoconfiguration will not assign it an IP.  I know it is a functional card, I've used it before in other distros.  ANy idea why it wouldn't work please?
[02:58] <thor> ToddEDM2: if you don't know how to use nano as an editor you can use gedit instead
[02:58] <electron> quit edit
[02:58] <ToddEDM2> lol
[02:59] <blkthndr> I have a folder that windows reads as hidden, is there any way i can change this using ubuntu?
=== recon is now known as reconnect
[02:59] <user_> how to do clean uninstallation after i play enough with wine (apt-get install wine) ? i need to remove the software and all of wine configuration
[02:59] <thor> ToddEDM2: is that you slipping over the brink?
[02:59] <Hanyou> Hey, does anyone here know anything about Wine? Their IRC is kinda dead.
[02:59] <electron> del syetrbfbf
[02:59] <ToddEDM2> ok i think im gonna scrap this little excesize of the mind... i will just email the shit to the desktop... seems quicker
[02:59] <electron> software
[02:59] <ToddEDM2> yes thor
[02:59] <thor> ToddEDM2: if you get that one file created it should do the trick.
[03:00] <Acidfried> anyone know a decent dc++ client other than linux dc
[03:00] <vee_> danbhfive: I am at the point Guided, but which one ; entire disk / entire disk and set up LVM / entire disk and set up encrypted LVM? then theres the first- resize (which is prolly what i dont want) and manual
[03:00] <thor> ToddEDM2: but if you want to let it go we can do that too.
=== reconnect is now known as recon0
[03:00] <thor> ToddEDM2: bookmark the howto so you can find it tomorrow
[03:01] <thor> ToddEDM2: when you access swat you will see what I meant...it makes samba SO easy
[03:01] <blkthndr> I have a folder that windows reads as hidden, is there any way i can change this using ubuntu?
[03:01] <danbhfive> vee_ dont you want the first?  I don't know, I always have chosen manual  :(
[03:01] <ToddEDM2> thor.. i got the file made, how do i save it ?
[03:01] <thor> ToddEDM2: are you using nano?
[03:02] <ToddEDM2> yup
[03:02] <danbhfive> vee_ if you choose manual, all you need to do is have at least one partition marked as /
[03:02] <thor> ToddEDM2: just hit control-X and it will prmpt if you want to save. Say yes and it will ask for the filename
[03:02] <thor> ToddEDM2: no..it already knows the filename <smile>
[03:02] <craigbass1976> I've just read https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wxwidgets2.8/+bug/68792 about amue crashing all the time when updating.  What's the eta on a solution, anyone know?
[03:03] <vee_> danbhfive choosing manual
[03:03] <thor> ToddEDM2: then 'sudo /usr/sbin/xinetd restart'
[03:03] <TigranG> Whats an alternative network manager than network-manager?
[03:03] <thor> ToddEDM2: then open the browser on the desktop and type 'localhost:901' for the url
[03:03] <djezer> robdig yeah, but some themes i installed crashed the window manager gnome and kde
[03:03] <Baumer> So Apparently I don't have the 3D accelerator or something installed correctly on ubuntu... how would I go about installing that for a integrated intel graphics card?
[03:04] <ToddEDM2> :)
[03:04] <thor> ToddEDM2: did you get it?
[03:04] <djezer> i neede to find a way to open my themes settings from a command
[03:04] <vee_> danbhfive: now i see Guided / Help partioneg below that are two SATA drives - one has a submenu
[03:04] <craigbass1976> Is there another file sharing app that installs easily in Ubuntu?
[03:04] <vee_> danbhfive # 1 primary and #5 logical
[03:04] <djezer> anyone know the program name so i can launch the themes manager in ubuntu
[03:04] <ToddEDM2> yes thor
[03:05] <thor> ToddEDM2: on the printers tab....
[03:05] <ToddEDM2> no im logged into some samba page
[03:05] <thor> ToddEDM2: there is a drop down for Choose Printer
[03:05] <ToddEDM2> ohh ok
[03:05] <danbhfive> vee_ mmk, are they partitioned?
[03:05] <danbhfive> vee_ how much do you know about partitioning?
[03:05] <vee_> when it comes to linux - 0
[03:05] <ToddEDM2> you want me back in cups?
[03:06] <danbhfive> vee_ how about in windows? ie not linux?
[03:06] <thor> ToddEDM2: no...we need to define the printer in samba first
[03:06] <ToddEDM2> ok
[03:06] <vee_> windows an d mac - yes
[03:06] <user_> i want to backup /home/user  is this correct use this command: tar -czf user_backup.tar.gz /home/user
[03:06] <vee_> danbhfive: win and mac yes
[03:06] <thor> ToddEDM2: in swat you should see eight icons at the top...if not then you didn't log in as an administrator
[03:06] <danbhfive> vee_ how would you partition in those cases
[03:06] <danbhfive> user_ probably not, i dont think that works
[03:07] <thor> ToddEDM2: there should be Home-globals-shares-printers-etc
[03:07] <ToddEDM2> ok i didnt , i see 4
[03:07] <user_> danbhfive, what is the correct one?
[03:07] <thor> ToddEDM2: then close the page, open it again, and log in as an adminstrator
[03:07] <blkthndr> I have a folder that windows reads as hidden, is there any way i can change this using ubuntu?
[03:08] <danbhfive> vee_ i mean, im not sure if I know what you need, you could just format them both to ext3, set one to mount as / and the other to something like /media/other
[03:08] <vee_> danbhfive most of the available space would go to data, if I have two or more drives I drop my data from one HD to another
[03:08] <ToddEDM2> o i closed it, tried the other login/pass no go
[03:08] <ToddEDM2> whats the administrators login/pass????
[03:08] <danbhfive> user_ why are you backing up /home?
[03:08] <ztomic> blkthndr: why are you trying to do that?
[03:08] <Assid> man
[03:08] <Amendt> any ubuntu laptops in Canada?
[03:08] <Assid> this final release of ubuntu is messed up
[03:09] <thor> ToddEDM2: in ubuntu the admin is the first user you define...who was first when you installed on the desktop?
[03:09] <user_> danbhfive, i want to backup /home/user , not /home
[03:09] <Assid> i dont get anything while the machine starts
[03:09] <blkthndr> its for my mp3 player
[03:09] <Assid> no loader or anything
[03:09] <vee_> danbhfive: system then two partitions (equal in size but way bigger than system) for data
[03:09] <user_> danbhfive, i want to re-install my ubuntu
[03:09] <user_> danbhfive, upgrade it to 7.10
[03:09] <ztomic> blkthndr: this is a foldaer that should not be hidden?
[03:09] <user_> danbhfive, because right now i use 7.04
[03:09] <PsyDeViL> hmm. can anyone suggest me what ubuntu version i should stick with.  i have tried gutsy , feisty , on my desktop and they install by using safe graphics mode.  However when i try to use edgy eft i can not boot into install.  The system crashes and i hear a beep and screen goes black. (if any1 could shed some light on boot options to use with f6).  The reason i am doing this is because my ati AGP card is not supported in fesity and gutsy.  
[03:09] <blkthndr> yes it should not be hidden
[03:09] <ToddEDM2> thor, i did that... gave me only 4 icons
[03:09] <Assid> err.. did someone screw up on the release?
[03:09] <ztomic> blkthndr: is it hidden in windows?
[03:10] <Assid> the loader is just dead
[03:10] <blkthndr> yes its hidden in windows, i dont have windows to change the status though
[03:10] <danbhfive> vee_ well, if you mount one drive as /, basically everything will go there
[03:10] <thor> ToddEDM2: then open a terminal....type 'passwd root' and give a password for root...I always do that when I first install for just these reasons
[03:10] <vee_> danbhfive: I will be placing my Mac and Windows files on the data partitions as well
[03:10] <Taa5i> Hello.  I'm attempting to install using a Xircom rbem56g cardbus ethernet adapter and network autoconfiguration will not assign it an IP.  I know it is a functional card, I've used it before in other distros.  ANy idea why it wouldn't work please?  I really can't install without getting this working.  :/
[03:10] <thor> ToddEDM2: then log in with the user id 'root' and the password you just defined
[03:10] <pike_> PsyDeViL: well.. if youre going to go with an older version have you considered dapper? its the long term support version
[03:10] <danbhfive> vee_ are you dual booting? or try booting?
[03:11] <thor> ToddEDM2: I have about five hours of notes about things to tell you....we need to continue this at another time <smile> (or via email)
[03:11] <thor> ToddEDM2: let me know when you are logged into swat as root
[03:11] <pike_> PsyDeViL: id suggest you maybe just ebay the ati card though and buy a dirt cheap nvidia :)
[03:12] <ToddEDM2> k
[03:12] <blkthndr> the problem is that because it is a windows hidden file, my mp3 player cannot read it.
[03:12] <danbhfive> user_ do you want to be able to restore the files?
[03:12] <vee_> danbhfive: I would like one drive with a good size partition for system and apps, plus a much bigger portion for M and W data backup, while the other drive I want to store just M and W data
[03:12] <thor> ToddEDM2: you have eight icons now?
[03:12] <ToddEDM2> yup
[03:13] <thor> ToddEDM2: the printers icon....
[03:13] <ToddEDM2> k
[03:13] <vee_> danbhfive: i dont want to ever have a chance of messing up the system (ha)
[03:13] <thor> ToddEDM2: check the drop down list for Choose Printer and see if one is defined
[03:13] <danbhfive> vee_ but are you dual booting?  i didnt think you were, are you talking about when you actually setup the ftp?
[03:13] <thor> ToddEDM2: is there anything besides 'printers'?
[03:13] <cry0k1n3t1c> Anybody know how to configure an ad hoc connection in gutsy?
[03:14] <ztomic> blkthndr: that dont make sense. Does your mp3 player work with Linux/Ubuntu?
[03:14] <slvmchn> i'm having a lot of trouble with this, i had hda/sda1 = windows, hda/sda2 = storage, and hda/sda5 = linux partition... i installed XP over the vista partition, but now grub doesn't load at all
[03:14] <vee_> danbhfive: at this point no, in the future i will purchase a separate drive for that
[03:14] <slvmchn> before i was using grub to dual boot
[03:14] <ToddEDM2> no just printers, and mine is listed
[03:14] <blkthndr> yes it works fine
[03:14] <danbhfive> user_  sudo rsync -aS /home/<user>/. /<backup location>/.
[03:14] <slvmchn> if i change the boot partition i can't get linux to load at all, and i can't get grub to set up right using a live cd
[03:14] <cry0k1n3t1c> slvmchn: When you install XP, it overwrites the MBR
[03:14] <vee_> danbhfive: i really want this machine to be a server (another ha)
[03:14] <slvmchn> cry0k1n3t1c: i am aware of this
[03:14] <slvmchn> cry0k1n3t1c: how do i reset it
[03:14] <thor> ToddEDM2: what do yo mean yours is listed? Is there a printer there in the list? If so ....highlight it and click Choose Printer
[03:15] <danbhfive> vee_ then dont bother with partitioning much, you want to use ALL the space for linux
[03:15] <cry0k1n3t1c> slvchn: Did you try to reinstall GRUB from the live CD?
=== matthew_ is now known as person
[03:15] <ToddEDM2> ok i did that thor
[03:15] <blkthndr> i use rockbox firmware on my mp3 player, when i boot the mp3 players original firmware it makes the music folder hidden, rockbox cannot find the hidden music folder
[03:15] <ztomic> blkthndr: and copying the folder is unacceptable?
[03:15] <slvmchn> cry0k1n3t1c: yes but it gave me problems
[03:15] <thor> OK...the important ones....
[03:15] <blkthndr> I could copy the folder but its a huge folder
[03:15] <thor> ToddEDM2: path = /var/spool/samba
[03:15] <danbhfive> vee_ linux will be holding the files for other OS's, in fact, at this point, it doesnt matter
[03:15] <thor> ToddEDM2: guest = ok
[03:15] <blkthndr> and the problem will create itself again in the future
[03:15] <thor> ToddEDM2: printable=yes
[03:15] <ztomic> blkthndr: I understand but it should be visible.
[03:16] <thor> ToddEDM2: printer name (write that down!)
[03:16] <danbhfive> o crap
[03:16] <danbhfive> is there an admin?
[03:16] <thor> ToddEDM2: browseable = yes
[03:16] <cry0k1n3t1c> So, is it even possible to set up an Ad Hoc connection between 2 ubuntu computers?
[03:16] <WorkingOnWise> any ideas y update manager cant fetch any repositories. eveythin comes back with a 404 error. I have a good network connection.
[03:16] <danbhfive> last time, i got banned from IRC for this
[03:16] <thor> ToddEDM2: available=yes
[03:16] <vee_> danbhfive: ok, so should i click on each and partition the entire device
[03:16] <danbhfive> i think i may log off
[03:16] <thor> ToddEDM2: that's it
[03:16] <thor> ToddEDM2: what is the printer name?
[03:16] <ToddEDM2> can i change the printer name?
[03:16] <thor> ToddEDM2: yup...if you want to
[03:16] <blkthndr> its visible to linux and ubuntu and a mac, rockbox does not see it becaues it is a windows hidden file.  when i had windows i could just unhide it, i can't do this using ubuntu because its not hidden to it
[03:16] <slvmchn> cry0k1n3t1c: i found some forum posts that showed how to set grub back up, by looking for stage1 boot whatever, and then when i do setup hd(0,0) or whatever the command is it starts to work but then says Errorr 22
[03:16] <ToddEDM2> psc_1200_series is what it is
[03:17] <thor> ToddEDM2: make it whatever you like
[03:17] <danbhfive> vee_ yeah, just one big partition for now
[03:17] <thor> ToddEDM2: then click Commit Changes at the top (near the drop down list)
[03:17] <pike_> cry0k1n3t1c: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Adhoc
[03:17] <vee_> danbhfive: creating new partition tables for each right now
[03:17] <danbhfive> vee_ you should just get things up and running as close as you can to how you want
[03:17] <ToddEDM2> ok done
[03:17] <danbhfive> vee_ you can worry about more fancy partitioning later
[03:18] <thor> ToddEDM2: now you should be able to define that printer in cups on the laptop
[03:18] <vee_> danbhfive kewl
[03:18] <ToddEDM2> ok
[03:18] <thor> ToddEDM2: you do remember the printer name I hope <smile>
[03:18] <ztomic> blkthndr: that's a predicament.
[03:18] <Taa5i> Why doesn't the ubuntu install cd come with ping??  It's really hard to try to diagnose network issues without it and/or traceroute....
[03:18] <Kubala> hello word
[03:18] <blkthndr> there are ways around it so i can access my music, but i just want to know if the problem can be fixed
[03:18] <Kubala> hihi;]
[03:19] <Kubala> sleep now
[03:19] <Kubala> ; ]
[03:19] <ToddEDM2> now i add printers , in cups on the laptop
[03:19] <ToddEDM2> ?
[03:19] <Kubala> people; ]
[03:19] <thor> ToddEDM2: yup...you can add that printer in cups on the laptop
[03:19] <thor> ToddEDM2: smb://ipaddress/name
[03:20] <curfmans> anyone know how to put tibia on ubuntu
[03:20] <Taa5i> Also could someone point me towards a pcmcia ethernet card that's known to work with the installer?  I'm using a xircom_cb one which fails.
[03:20] <ztomic> blkthndr: maybe you can be more specific. it does sound like a hardware issue that is solvable.
[03:20] <PsyDeViL> thanks pike just downloading dapper now
[03:20] <PsyDeViL> will give it a shot
[03:20] <thor> ToddEDM2: and use the same printer driver you are using in the desktop. If you don't remember it you can access cups on the desktop and look...just don't change it on the desktop as it is working
[03:20] <Assid> err.. wtf is wrong with the default live cd installation of ubuntu?
[03:20] <vee_> danbhfive ok both say under there sub menus: pri/log 500.1 GB FREE SPACE, im clcking FINISH partitioning and write changes to disk
[03:20] <Assid> i dont see the loading progress bar
[03:20] <Assid> just a blank black while ubuntu loads
[03:21] <PsyDeViL> its just that i downloaded edgy livecd and it wont install. - the reason i am going to old version is so i can use my gfx card.
[03:21] <ztomic> but I'm at a loss as to why someone would hide a music folder.
[03:21] <Shadow147> hey I need to get into just the command prompt
[03:21] <blkthndr> Its not a hardware issue.  I'm just trying to change the hidden status of a folder, the problem is its a windows hidden folder and not a linux hidden folder
[03:21] <thor> Shadow147: just open a terminal
[03:21] <Taa5i> bloody useless channel..
[03:21] <qwerty121> Hi all! Which download manager is the best in Ubuntu?
[03:21] <Shadow147> thor I need to stop gnome
[03:22] <thor> Shadow147: or press Alt-Ctrl-F2
[03:22] <ztomic> blkthndr: there-in lies the problem
[03:22] <ToddEDM2> lets hope this works.. wifey is home now
[03:22] <thor> Shadow147: A-C-F2 thru F6
[03:22] <user_> why some people suggest me to compress a folder with tar.gz (tar -czvf backup.tar.gz /var/www) insted using gzip /var/www so it return www.gz  ??
[03:22] <thor> ToddEDM2: keep the faith...everything is set...if it doesn't work it is a missing checkmark or some such...a very minor thing
[03:22] <user_> what is the benefit using .tar insted gz ?
[03:22] <ToddEDM2> didnt work ... i will try again later
[03:23] <Viper> I think .tar is just an archive, no compression.
[03:23] <thor> ToddEDM2: truly! I can't imagine why. Sorry
[03:23] <Viper> .tar.gz is compressed... I think that's how it works.
[03:23] <Chronosphear> is missing/broken gnome applets a common issue when dist-upgrading to gutsy?
[03:23] <thor> ToddEDM2: I am looking at mine as we work on this...it is set up just like mine
[03:23] <dude> .
[03:23] <erisco> I have a few .vcd's.. I know I looked up in the past of how to make these into iso's... I forget =\ anyone know?
[03:23] <user_> Viper,  so why not we just use .gz than .tar.gz  ?
[03:23] <blkthndr> so there is no way I can change its hidden status without using windows?
[03:23] <thor> ToddEDM2: and it works...sort of <smile>
[03:23] <ztomic> blkthndr: perhaps linux would be able to read AMIGA floppy disks as well? Nope. aint gonna happen.
[03:24] <thor> ToddEDM2: spnye@yahoo.com if you want to follow up on this and other stuff
[03:24] <danbhfive> user_ gz is just compression, for a single file, tar binds several files together
[03:24] <thor> ToddEDM2: tell wifey you worked REAL hard
[03:24] <erisco> I have a few .vcd's.. I know I looked up in the past of how to make these into iso's... I forget =\ anyone know?
[03:24] <danbhfive> user_ i think you use them both to create an archive
=== monkey_ is now known as monTree
[03:24] <ztomic> slightly different problem but none-the-less... it aint gonna happen.
[03:24] <danbhfive> user_ but you should use the command I have you for /home
[03:24] <user_> danbhfive, so can not to gzip /var/www   is that what you mean?
[03:24] <user_> danbhfive, so i must tar it first
[03:25] <danbhfive> user_ i think thats the case
[03:25] <user_> danbhfive, then compress it, example use gz
[03:25] <qwerty121> hi all! which download manager is best for Ubuntu?
[03:25] <user_> danbhfive, ok thanks
[03:25] <danbhfive> user_ tar can gzip it for you, just add a z directive, i believe
[03:25] <Viper> qwerty: I use firefox's built-in one, or flashget...
[03:25] <qwerty121> Viper: does flashget support resume?
[03:26] <Viper> qwerty: yup, as long as the server does.
[03:26] <Chronosphear> is missing/broken gnome applets a common issue when dist-upgrading to gutsy?
[03:26] <ztomic> blkthndr: try googling it.
[03:26] <Viper> user_: tar -xzf /path/to/directory/to/compress
[03:26] <dude> why hasnt everyone just switched to *bsd yet?
[03:26] <dude> :P
[03:26] <WorkingOnWise> any ideas y update manager cant fetch any repositories. eveything comes back with a 404 error. I have a good network connection.
[03:26] <user_> yes.. thanks
[03:26] <Viper> tar -z tells the tar application to use a foreign compression app.
[03:26] <ztomic> dude: huh?
[03:26] <danbhfive> Chronosphear, i have broken applets for a similar upgrade
[03:27] <user_> Viper, x is for extract
[03:27] <qwerty121> Viper: thanks
[03:27] <Chronosphear> some work, most don't?
[03:27] <Viper> oh... same diff... lol   tar -cz then
[03:27] <user_> Viper, i think it should tar czvf
[03:27] <blkthndr> i've tried googling with no help for a couple days, as well as trying the support forums and irc of rockbox
[03:27] <user_> Viper,  yes.. or the simple one is cz
[03:27] <ztomic> dude: I can think of 12 reasons right now, and I could probably think of more.
[03:27] <Viper> I rarely find myself compressing files, decompressing is much more common for me...
[03:27] <danbhfive> Chronosphear did you use the update manager? or did you use the cli?
[03:28] <Chronosphear> update manager and then the cli because update manager only did half tho job
[03:28] <Chronosphear> the*
[03:28] <danbhfive> heh, that sucks
[03:28] <Viper> Has anyone experience with an add-on PCI SATA raid card in Ubuntu?>
[03:28] <Chronosphear> danbhfive, yeah, i rebooted thinking it was sorted and logged into a bash prompt with no window manager
[03:29] <danbhfive> in the past, cli doesn't fully work, i don't think
[03:29] <CGI074> yes Viper
[03:29] <ztomic> 20 reasons not to switch to BSD:
[03:29] <danbhfive> you have to re-run the upgrade commands several times
=== CGI074 is now known as r3wt1nth3b0x
[03:29] <ztomic> 1) you like Windows or linux.
[03:29] <Chronosphear> danbhfive, i'll give that a go then
[03:29] <Viper> rwrandomnessb0x: Any luck, and if so, which make/model?
[03:29] <ztomic> 2) you play games that were made for Windows.
[03:30] <ztomic> 3) BSD is hard to install
[03:30] <Chronosphear> danbhfive, ah nah, it's convinced there's nothing to do now
[03:30] <r3wt1nth3b0x> Viper, it was a adaptec i think.
[03:30] <r3wt1nth3b0x> Works great.
[03:30] <danbhfive> Chronosphear i can give you some suggestions, to check it
[03:30] <Chronosphear> danbhfive, sure
[03:30] <danbhfive> sudo apt-get install -f
[03:30] <WorkingOnWise> are the repos down?
[03:30] <Powaqqatsi> does anyone know how to edit the hotkeys for compiz effects?
[03:30] <scguy318> ztomic: there's been some progress in porting Wine to FreeBSD me thinks
[03:31] <scguy318> ztomic: and really it depends on your OS taste
[03:31] <Viper> r3w: And you didn't have any issues with MDADM?
[03:31] <ztomic> 4) Wine is pain in the arse
[03:31] <danbhfive> sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^
[03:31] <Chronosphear> danbhfive, 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
[03:31] <scguy318> ztomic: ditto for Wine on Linux :P
[03:31] <Chronosphear> hrmm
[03:31] <Chronosphear> that is probably it
[03:31] <Viper> @ztomic: wine is about the best linux has for playing win32 games/apps :(
[03:31] <Chronosphear> when i got the bash window and no wm i just installed metacity and gnome
[03:31] <danbhfive> carrot is not a spelling mistake
[03:32] <vee_> danbhfive ok both say under there sub menus: pri/log 500.1 GB FREE SPACE, im clcking FINISH partitioning and write changes to disk, now when I go to finish it says no /root found
[03:32] <r3wt1nth3b0x> No Viper...
[03:32] <Powaqqatsi> does anyone know the hotkey for scale?
[03:32] <Chronosphear> oh, meta package
[03:32] <ztomic> 5) You work with Windows at work and don't care about BSD.
[03:32] <danbhfive> vee_ did you set one of the partitions to /  ?
[03:32] <r3wt1nth3b0x> Viper why would you be using MDADM with hardware RAID?
[03:32] <danbhfive> no, its a directive actually, i think
[03:32] <alimoe> hi
[03:32] <cryptnix> bsd is hard to install?
[03:32] <cryptnix> uhh
[03:32] <alimoe> i think opera is great
[03:33] <erisco> I have a data disk that is in VCD format. How can I change this to an ISO format so I can burn it into a CD?
[03:33] <Chronosphear> The following packages have unmet dependencies.  firefox: Conflicts: libnss3 but 2:1.firefox2.0.0.10+1nobinonly-0ubuntu1 is to be installed E: Broken packages
[03:33] <Viper> None of the other sata cards' RAID has been detected by linux...
[03:33] <Chronosphear> can't see it being that tho
[03:33] <ztomic> 6) You have tried BSD in the past and you don't want to make that mistake again. But you tried OpenBSD just to be sure.
[03:33] <r3wt1nth3b0x> Viper brb
[03:33] <danbhfive> try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[03:34] <Chronosphear> nothing to do
[03:34] <vee_> danbhfive shoudl one be logical and one be primary?
[03:34] <WorkingOnWise> are the gutsy repos down?
[03:34] <vladc> Ubuntu 7.10 causes my iMac G3 to restart very early in the boot process (3 seconds after yaboot). Passing "video=ofonly" kernel param didn't work, but the latest debian boots with no problem. Any ideas?
[03:34] <danbhfive> vee_ nah
[03:34] <danbhfive> vee_ thats only if you are breaking up the harddrives into several partitions
[03:34] <erisco> I have a data disk that is in VCD format. How can I change this to an ISO format so I can burn it into a CD?
[03:34] <vee_> danbhfive im clearing them again (thanx for baring with me)
[03:35] <alimoe> if its was for microsft i wuld have used NERO burner
[03:35] <ztomic> 7) you heard Unix is different than LInux and you wanted to try a REAL OS but you were not smart enough.
[03:35] <cry0k1n3t1c> Can anybody help me, I am trying to use this computer as a hub to connect my other computers to the internet
[03:35] <r00tintheb0x> okay Viper, what card are you using?
[03:35] <Viper> can K3B handle VCD's?
[03:35] <Impiety> so amarok works as root but doesn't work u sing my normal account
[03:35] <Impiety> what might cause this
[03:35] <danbhfive> Chronosphear how about sudo apt-get autoremove
[03:35] <r00tintheb0x> permissions Impiety
[03:35] <Impiety> hrm
[03:35] <vee_> danbhfive both say FREE SPACE under them, now what
[03:35] <Impiety> all of the libs look good
[03:35] <Impiety> permissionwise
[03:36] <Viper> r00t: I'm not sure off the top of my head, it was a cheapy pseude-raid controller...
[03:36] <danbhfive> vee_  wait, did you informat them?
[03:36] <Cyntek> Should Alsa automatically pickup Realtek onboard sound devices?
[03:36] <Chronosphear> you mean autoclean?
[03:36] <danbhfive> autoremove
[03:36] <Chronosphear> did nothing
[03:36] <vee_> danbhfive i clciked manual under the partitioning menu
[03:36] <ztomic> 8) you heard that windows applications can run on it but when you tried to get help, none was available so you ditched it.
=== _vector_ is now known as _vector_afk
[03:37] <danbhfive> ok, i would use synaptic then, and resolve those broken dependencies
[03:37] <ztomic> 9) never heard of it.
[03:37] <vee_> danbhfive then i hit <enter> with each drive selected
[03:37] <danbhfive> uninstall any package that doesnt have a valid source
[03:37] <r00tintheb0x> Viper i need the model to find the correct module to load.
[03:37] <ztomic> 10) it's great but how do I...?
[03:37] <danbhfive> vee_ are the drives formatted at this point?
[03:37] <vee_> danbhfive it then asked me whether or not to create new empty partition table
[03:38] <gaoxla_> mp3melayu
[03:38] <Chronosphear> how do i get a list of packages that don't have a valid source?
[03:38] <ztomic> 11) I work in Windows.
[03:38] <vee_> danbhfive i said yes to both
[03:38] <Baumer> If i get the error "Could not initialize graphics system.  Make sure that your video card and driver are compatible with direct draw"  Whwat should I be looking at?
[03:38] <vee_> danbhfive dioes that mena they are formatted?
[03:38] <kitche> ztomic: do you like spamming?
[03:38] <Viper> r00t: One sec, I'll get the model#
[03:38] <danbhfive> vee_ i dont know
[03:38] <danbhfive> vee_ its graphical isnt it?  if it says "free space" then its not formated
[03:38] <r00tintheb0x> ok Viper
[03:39] <ztomic> kitche: proving a point... 12) I like to prove my point.
[03:39] <danbhfive> Chronosphear look under Installed (local or obsolete)
[03:39] <danbhfive> get rid of those, unless its something that you personally put there
[03:39] <Chronosphear> danbhfive, ah, thanks
[03:39] <cry0k1n3t1c> is it even possible to connect two computers in ubuntu via ad hoc?
[03:39] <Viper> r00t: Syba SD-SATA-4P    PCI Sata Controller
[03:40] <WorkingOnWise> I do apt-get update and every repo is said to be not available, giving a 404 error, but I can ping the ip address that apt-get is trying to pull from. whats wrong?

[03:40] <danbhfive> vee_ you lost me at some point
[03:40] <mEck0> Hi! when I try to install kdm-kde4, I got this message: "E: kdm-kde4: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1", whats wrong and how do I solve it
[03:40] <Chronosphear> WorkingOnWise, try a different repo
[03:40] <me> danbhfive, no, I'm still here.
[03:40] <danbhfive> vee_ you should format the drive, AND set the mount point
[03:40] <vee_> danbhfive if I select a dirve then hit <enter> I see a menu for Create a new Partition, Auto part. the free space, or Show Cylinder/head/Sector Info
[03:40] <vee_> danbhfive does that sound familiar?
[03:41] <rooly> i'm having a bit of trouble with my sata drive. it decides to shut-off for no reason after i do high amounts of i/o (aka bittorrent) on the drive
[03:41] <danbhfive> is it all freespace right now?
[03:41] <vee_> yes
[03:41] <Viper> r00t, I don't think you'll have any luck finding out why I didn't have any luck with the card, posts on newegg say it doesn't like Ubuntu...
[03:41] <vee_> both drives
[03:41] <danbhfive> vee_ ok, yes, click create a new drive button, where ever that is
[03:41] <WorkingOnWise> Chronosphear: i get that error for every repo..ann 112 of them
[03:41] <danbhfive> vee_ then select ext3, and then look for a place to set the mount point
[03:42] <danbhfive> vee_ set the mount point to /
[03:42] <Chronosphear> WorkingOnWise, are you set to use a proxy?
[03:42] <ztomic> 13) I got my point across and now I'de like to list 20 reasons that DOS is better than Windows.
[03:42] <vee_> danbhfive ok but first i have to select logical or primary to get to that menu
[03:42] <vee_> danbhfive which one?
[03:42] <danbhfive> primary
[03:42] <HalflingRogue> I'm getting a CPU overload and big networking problems. Can anybody help?
[03:42] <HalflingRogue> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3865216#post3865216
[03:43] <ztomic> 14.. 15 16 17 18 19 20... ok
[03:43] <danbhfive> logical is if you are creating more than 4 partitions, and you are only making one
[03:43] <WorkingOnWise> Chronosphear: no. the only change I am aware of is last night I manually deleted the apt cache.

[03:54] <vee_> danbhfive doesnt give me media in the list so i entered it manually
[03:54] <danbhfive> vee_ /home is good for reinstalling linux, but that can come when you are more familiar with this stuff

[03:55] <danbhfive> np
[03:55] <NemesisD> anyone know of the boot option for ubuntu to have it not check floppy drives? i'm setting up a persistent install of ubuntu on a USB drive and it works fine on this computer but i get a bunch of fd0 i/o errors on a computer without a floppy drive
[03:55] <IamReck> and turn the volume all the way up on all of them
[03:55] <r00tintheb0x> So you're building the RAID1 VIA teh BIOS on the card?
[03:55] <Assid> this sucks
[03:55] <grazz> ztomic, yeah, im having a lot of problems too
[03:55] <reportingsjr> How can I use more resolutions with my monitor? I tried changing the type but that ended up screwing it up. I've tried this monitor with a seperate computer and know I can get much larger resolutions, and the g card supports up to 2048 x 1536. Right now the highest is 1024x768 (ugh). Anyone have any clue what's wrong here?
[03:56] <Assid> i cant see the damn screen while it boots.. and it takes longer cause of that
[03:56] <danbhfive> Chronosphear, can I pm you?
