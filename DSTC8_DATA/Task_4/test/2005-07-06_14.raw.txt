[11:11] <Seveas> Amaranth, the US peer is probably breaking the law
[11:11] <Seveas> but an ES or NL peer downloading it not
[11:11] <monchichi> http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8419601/
[11:11] <IceDC571> the US peer is just stupid for wanting to share movies in the first place
[11:11] <Seveas> The downloader is breaking the implicit rules of good netizenship though :)
[11:11] <IceDC571> why cant you just buy the full quality dvd from a shop?
[11:12] <Amaranth> i buy my music off iTunes (support the artists, easier) and watch movies in the theater (their entertainment system is nicer than mine)
[11:12] <Edulix> IceDC571: that's his business :P
[11:12] <Amaranth> the US peer is breaking US law, of course
[11:12] <monchichi> Seveas, check the link, people in netherlands got rolled on too
[11:12] <Edulix> IceDC571: are you really doing that question ? maybe becuase it's not cheap ?
[11:13] <Amaranth> anyway, this is all highly off-topic and is actually one of the banned topics, so yeah
[11:13] <Edulix> hehe ok
[11:13] <Seveas> monchichi, those aren't downloaders, but crackers :)
[11:13] <IceDC571> Amaranth: would libdvdcss2 be illegal in the US?
[11:14] <monchichi> true, but they targeted crackers because they cant possibly target all the downloaders
[11:14] <IceDC571> decss i mean
[11:14] <Amaranth> yes
[11:14] <Amaranth> canada too
[11:14] <Amaranth> and much of the EU
[11:14] <Seveas> Amaranth, well, to be really strict: this kind of discussion is not one of the 'banned topics' since we're not supporting people trying to do illegal things ;)
[11:14] <sobralense> Ok ok, U have great theaters with a brand new movie playing .. but here...
[11:14] <cikilin> can anybody help me see a dvd on linux?
[11:14] <IceDC571> so how do I view dvds in linux legally? pshh..
[11:15] <Amaranth> IceDC571: You pay $30 for this program that only works on one version of one distro.
[11:15] <IceDC571> Amaranth: whats that?

[11:15] <Amaranth> IceDC571: No idea.
[11:15] <Amaranth> IceDC571: The distro is turbolinux, iirc.
[11:16] <Edulix> monchichi: maybe it was illegal to distribute the things but not to download them ?
[11:16] <IceDC571> i dont really watch dvds on the computer anyway
[11:16] <IceDC571> so i guess im good
[11:16] <ailean> you can watch dvds in linux legally by paying a royalty
[11:17] <Edulix> actually I belive some distros distribuced some parts of libdvdcss that are legal
[11:17] <Edulix> so that you can play dvd but not rip it
[11:17] <Amaranth> libdvdcss is not legal at all
[11:17] <Edulix> AMaranth: talk with linspire about that :P
[11:17] <Amaranth> Edulix: They're nuts.
[11:18] <IceDC571> lol.. linspire wont be legal for long..
[11:18] <Amaranth> Breaking the encryption to play a movie is just as illegal as breaking the encryption to rip a movie.
[11:18] <IceDC571> i cant believe walmart gave in to their deal
[11:19] <Edulix> IceDC571: I think that if they do that it's because it's legal, and they are surely more informed than me, I don't know about you...
[11:19] <Amaranth> Edulix: No, the guy that started linspire just likes to piss big people off.
[11:19] <IceDC571> linspire has been in court several times
[11:20] <monchichi> who owns the css license?
[11:20] <ailean> me
[11:20] <Amaranth> dvdcca
[11:20] <monchichi> can i watch the movies i bought?

[11:23] <Amaranth> well, i suppose you could try to get in on the DMCA's reverse engineering clause, but no one has successfully done so yet
[11:23] <IceDC571> openoffice format isnt a reversed engineered word format, they're different
[11:23] <jeroen_> ailean, maybe, but US law is fucked up
[11:23] <ailean> i know
[11:23] <jeroen_> because it is encrypted it's evil
[11:23] <Amaranth> plus iirc illegally releasing a trade secret doesn't make it lose it's trade secret status

[11:37] <Amaranth> jeroen_: Not sure about that.
[11:37] <Edulix> jeroen_: at least the encription can't be strong, because it's not allowed (in the US) :P
[11:37] <monchichi> linuxnewbie, then add the users that you want access to the "networking" group
[11:37] <IceDC571> cion: firewall should already be running (iptables)
[11:37] <Amaranth> Edulix: strong encryption is legal
[11:37] <cion> ICE: what do u mean?
[11:37] <jeroen_> Edulix, but if you're not allowed to crack it, it's still a problem, no matter how weak
[11:38] <Edulix> jeroen_: well of course
[11:38] <Amaranth> adobe used rot13 and sucessfully used the DMCA to stop people 'cracking' it

[11:52] <jeroen_> curut, In synaptic, right-click on amsn -> mark suggested for installation -> imagemagick. That'll select imagemagick for installations aswell. You don't need to install the other 3 things Amsn suggests, they're 3 different browsers (and shouldn't really show up there)
[11:52] <javier_> i need the apache2.conf
[11:52] <javier_> please
[11:53] <Edulix> javier: the default one
[11:53] <javier_> anybody sendme this file?
[11:53] <hyphenated> ukato: k3b can do it if you want a gui, or dd if you want something on the command line. there's probably plenty of other tools to do it as well

[11:53] <jeroen_> dystopia, Do you have a separate /home? It should be easy then. I don't know if dist-upgrade will work, for example because Ubuntu uses Xorg and Debian Xfree
[11:53] <jeroen_> javier_, you don't have a backup, like apache2.conf~ ?
[11:53] <ukato> hyphenated, ok, thanks
[11:53] <Edulix> javier_: sorry I haven't got it installed
[11:54] <javier_> no sorry
[11:54] <Edulix> javier_: you might just extract it from the deb package, I think
[11:54] <javier_> the file is corrupt
[11:54] <Edulix> javier_:  the deb package ?
[11:54] <dystopia> jeroen_: no but i could make an image there or sth, the problem is my CD writer only writer 650 MB CDs and i don't have those anymore, i have no floppy drive, i don't know how to do netboot on x86, and i need ubuntu on it for someone else to use that comp b/c i won't be able to admin it for her
[11:54] <Edulix> then redowload it

[12:03] <Seveas> especially if they run a mailserver

[01:05] <LinuxNewbie> is there a way to manage the internet connections of students usernames?

[01:21] <morgs> LinuxNewbie: no, it's automatic. You can manage installed packages using Synaptic Package Manager, or you can do it with the command line. If you use the command line, apt-cache is the command to search through the local database (or cache) of the list of packages that you can install over the net.
[01:21] <{Seb}> where is the Xorg.log located?
[01:21] <{Seb}> after upgrading to breezy
[01:21] <slept> markuman, then you can use ati, if you want to use the nonfree driver you can find out your kernel version with uname -r and search for linux-restricted-modules-... install those with your kernelversion at the end

[01:43] <LinuxNewbie> hahaha...
[01:43] <holycow> the compartmentalization results in robust, stable, scalable, interchangeable systems
[01:43] <holycow> you can get linux to do anything
[01:43] <Originoo> man apt-get :)
[01:43] <LinuxNewbie> i got the idea now
[01:44] <enrico> sktrdie: what's the problem?
[01:44] <holycow> windows has been catching up to unix for the last 25 years essentially
[01:44] <holycow> linux is merely a 'reingeneering' of the unix toolsets and philosophy
[01:44] <Prottie> LinuxNewbie: http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/Samba-Guide.pdf print and read this one. it is very good if you want to learn samba.
[01:44] <holycow> and with the freedom, new tools are bein built
=== Will__ prays he can do this without re-rolling his kernel
[01:44] <holycow> LinuxNewbie, as a very very simple example

[01:45] <jaga> hi
[01:45] <Will__> There is something sacred to me about this, my first ubuntu install. Everything so far has just *worked*

[01:45] <jaga> will any one help me installing my sound player
[01:45] <jaga> to ubuntu
[01:45] <holycow> LinuxNewbie, how do you fix it?
[01:45] <jaga> its giveng me problme
[01:45] <sktrdie> enrico: for example If i try doing apt-get install mplayer
[01:45] <holycow> answer: you cant you haveto reinstall the whole system because they shoved a tool into the os that doesn't belong there
=== morgs [~morgan@wblv-146-225-53.telkomadsl.co.za]  has left #ubuntu [] 
[01:45] <LinuxNewbie> ok now
[01:45] <holycow> you can't just take ie out and reinstall/repair/etc. right?
[01:45] <Will__> rasputnik: I've usually let ipcop deal with firewall/packet forwarding issues for me. Perhaps today I will learn how to do it myself
[01:45] <holycow> with linux, you can pull any component out, look at it, fix it, config it, etc.
[01:45] <enrico> sktrdie: use aptitude, its better for back-dependencies, you should do "sudo aptitude search whatyoursearching"
[01:46] <holycow> so a: windows is simply a poor set of tools
[01:46] <enrico> sktrdie: then "sudo aptitude install therightname"
[01:46] <holycow> but it also is b: a set of gui wizards that automate most basic tasks
[01:46] <sktrdie> enrico: I think that my X is configured properly, I would like to reinstall it.. how do I do it
[01:46] <holycow> the consequence of b: is that people are tricked into thinking that its okay to be stupid and ignorant
[01:46] <enrico> sktrdie: reinstall it or just reconfigure it?
[01:46] <sktrdie> reisntall
[01:46] <holycow> that you can operate something as complicated as an os with no training / learning /thinking at all
[01:46] <enrico> sktrdie: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg for reconfiguring
[01:46] <holycow> and that simply is not true
[01:47] <rasputnik> Will__:  I confess I've never done it in Linux land (I'm a BSD guy, I've only just come back to Linux). But the priciples involved are universal
[01:47] <holycow> so yes, some windows users are put off by linux, primarily because they can no longer be lazy

[01:47] <Will__> rasputnik: I'm BSD also. I turned to ubuntu as...Linux makes a nicer desktop. I can see my BSD server from here. It needs to connect to the net though this box though
[01:47] <Originoo> I've heared there would be some problems when i remove sudo, is it true? i don't like to use sudo...
[01:48] <LinuxNewbie> or buy each log in to samba?

[01:48] <Will__> LinuxNewbie: What was your original problem? I think I walked in half-way though this
[01:48] <sktrdie> enrico: ok I'll try that... but yet if i try doing apt-get install mplayer, it installs mplayer, but I dunno how to open it, If I do mpalyer in terminal it wont work
[01:48] <rasputnik> holycow: but a lot of people just want to Get Things Done, don't they? I don't think it's fair to expect them to be gurus. M$ main failing is that they pretend you don't need to know anything
[01:48] <enrico> sktrdie: try mplayer --help
[01:48] <LinuxNewbie> ok will now
[01:49] <CarlFK> Originoo - I don't like to lock my front door, but I got used to it.  you sould keep using sudo untill you get used to it
[01:49] <Will__> sktrdie: I thought the package was mplayer-386 ?
[01:49] <enrico> sktrdie: never used it.
[01:49] <sktrdie> enrico: It doesnt find
[01:49] <holycow> rasputnik, then they shouldn't promise them the world, and lock the thing down
[01:49] <enrico> sktrdie: ahh ok, so its not installed.
[01:49] <Will__> Originoo: You could use su. Maybe setup a shortcut to a root terminal?
[01:49] <jaga> no i never used sktrdie
[01:49] <enrico> sktrdie: maybe you mispelled the package name .. search the right name .. with "sudo aptitude search mplayer"
[01:49] <jaga> i am trying it now
[01:49] <holycow> rasputnik, as well, 'just works' and 'just get something done' is highly subjective
[01:50] <rasputnik> Will__: I'd say they should either sell a black box or a hacker toy, instead of requiring Grannies to understand the danger of DLL conflicts
[01:50] <holycow> a programmers definition of a workflow that fits that will be entirely different from a graphic designers
[01:50] <holycow> as well as a system administrators
[01:50] <sktrdie> enrico: ok the one I isntalled is mplayer-powerpc
[01:50] <holycow> the problem is not 'just get it done', the problem is the user is taught that they can be a system administrator
[01:50] <sktrdie> but if I type "mplayer-powerpc
[01:50] <sktrdie> enrico: nothing happens
[01:50] <LinuxNewbie> is there a software in linux can act up like users can log in to ubuntu ang monitor what they are doing?
[01:50] <enrico> sktrdie: type "mplay" and the press tab
[01:50] <jaga> "sudo aptitude search mplayer" this does not mach any thing
[01:50] <holycow> and a system administrator, like say any other specialty, like a mechanic or a doctor, requires training and knowledge
[01:50] <Will__> Windows isn't that difficult to use or configure. You can do some great things. But it is harder to really understand.
[01:50] <sktrdie> enrico: nope
[01:51] <rasputnik> holycow: I'm really talking about end users who just want a platform to run their life on, be it web/mail/doc editing or CAD
[01:51] <Will__> holycow has a point. I think people are mislead into thinking they can do everything, easily
[01:51] <holycow> i.e. you are either a user or an administrator, just don't like to the user that they can be administrators by merely buying a licence to run an os
[01:51] <holycow> rasputnik, exactly.  but thats just one workflow.
[01:51] <Will__> Should I be drinking 6 shots of espresso for lunch?
[01:51] <sktrdie> o well... enrico: also sound isnt working :(
[01:51] <LinuxNewbie> there is no software that can monitor the client computers
[01:52] <sktrdie> enrico: also do you know where the kernel is located in Ubuntu? I thought it was always /usr/src/linux
[01:52] <LinuxNewbie> like what they are doing, what website they are in
[01:52] <holycow> as a user that wants that workflow to 'just work' he should buy a preinstalled system, installed by someone who knows, managed by someone who understands
[01:52] <enrico> sktrdie: hoary?
[01:52] <holycow> a user without training has no business installing software, setting up firewalls, etc.
[01:52] <sktrdie> yea
[01:52] <jaga> sorry i could not find mplayer
[01:52] <holycow> i realize i'm stating it too black and white, there are shades of grey here, but system administration is not a joke
[01:52] <rasputnik> holycow: but that's true in all OSes, isn't it? you can be clueless on any platform :)
[01:52] <enrico> try typing alsamixer
[01:52] <holycow> its not something you pick up on a weekend
[01:52] <holycow> rasputnik, right exactly
[01:52] <holycow> :)
[01:53] <sktrdie> enrico: that works... I mean if i open XMMS it only runs with the eSound Output Plugin
[01:53] <enrico> sktrdie: and check for wolumes
[01:53] <sktrdie> enrico: but If i select ALSA it doesnt' work

[01:55] <jaga> "sktrdie" where do i find this
[01:55] <enrico> sktrdie: you dont need to.

[01:57] <rasputnik> and I'd also add that if you are incompetent using word, you get a shit cv. if you are incompetent and firewall admin, the consequences are more serious

=== stig_ [~stig@dsl-121-26.oeke.tiscali.no]  has joined #ubuntu
[02:02] <stig_> how can I get access to my NTFS files from ubuntu? (fresh newbie asking) :)
[02:02] <holycow> stig_, unfortunately for now it requires a bit of work
[02:02] <holycow> a: you will only be able to read the ntfs files
[02:03] <holycow> b) you wont be able to write to an ntfs partition
[02:03] <stig_> I only need to read from it :)
[02:03] <holycow> ms keeps ntfs info secret, and any interim support for write has essentially dissapeared as no one cares enough to maintain the components
[02:03] <holycow> okay
[02:03] <holycow> then
[02:03] <jonbusby> hmmm hang on
[02:03] <jonbusby> may have solved this
[02:03] <jonbusby> brb
[02:03] <holycow> 1. you need to find your ntfs partition with sudo fdisk -l
=== fge [~insomniac@fge.user]  has left #ubuntu ["May] 
[02:04] <holycow> 2. you need to create a folder in say /media to wher eyou will mount to the ntfs partition ... mine is /media/ntfs
[02:04] <holycow> 3. you need to add info about the partition to your /etc/fstab
[02:04] <jonbusby> stig_ the ubuntuguide.org is really good on this
[02:04] <holycow> i'll paste a sample that i use
[02:05] <holycow> oh i don't have the line on this system
[02:05] <stig_> holycow: I think I made it it point 3... but dont know how I do that
[02:05] <holycow> google for fstab mount ntfs ... you will get lots of examples of the entry
[02:05] <holycow> the 4. sudo mount /media/ntfs
[02:05] <stig_> ok, thanks
=== [noobuntu]  [~chris@dsl-082-082-220-126.arcor-ip.net]  has joined #ubuntu

[02:51] <CarlFK> oh oh.. I am intalling Hoary to a toshiba 4600 laptop - it just "finished" and I get "I cannot start the X server...."
[02:51] <narkceh> hello. i installed ubuntu "server" so its the base. then i installed x-system and xfce4. But the problem is that how can i get root system console because here is now xterm or something?
[02:52] <CarlFK> and the it isn't responding to keyboard
[02:52] <delire> LinuxNewbie: use synaptic if you're more comfortable with it. think of it as a bit like a peer-to-peer client.
[02:52] <n0cturnal> yah... contains only "rpm"
[02:52] <delire> CarlFK: ctrl-alt-F1 and login. then we'll look at some logs
[02:53] <delire> narkceh: do you really need root? you can just 'sudo <command>'

[02:57] <mjr> kanichEEE, no, the number of the menu entry, starting with 0

[03:00] <delire> Vjaz: i wanted some new bluetooth and Asus stuff..
[03:00] <thomas__> hmm
[03:00] <delire> Vjaz: it is a little. i think the best approach with Ubuntu is let the maintainers ship the kernel for you.

[03:08] <delire> Albaraha: ok, now type 'apt-cache show splashy' and note the dependencies. where are you getting splashy from anyway?
[03:09] <Vjaz> narkceh, because you're trying to open /etc/modules as a regular user. what you're doing is essentially running "echo fglrx" with sudo and redirecting it to /etc/modules. You should run "sudo -s" or "sudo su -" and then run "echo fglrx >> /etc/modules"

[03:09] <delire> CarlFK: do you have another Linux box around? perhaps you can ssh into it
[03:09] <Vjaz> delire, Yeah, it's nice. I can't use my infrared before that though, but I haven't been able to do that before either, so it's not much of a problem. I might install vanilla Debian or something to see if it works while waiting.
[03:09] <delire> CarlFK: CarlFK: also note the other boot options
