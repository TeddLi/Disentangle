[10:21] <un_operateur> soujiro, errm, IIRC debian and ubuntu have a package named dyndns-client -- so you can install that instead
[10:22] <clayg> does beryl have to be sudo'd?
[10:22] <gnomefreak> clayg: dont hold me to this but i think you need xgl and beryl to get beryl to work. your better off asking in #ubuntu-xgl
[10:22] <Jordan_U> clayg: no
[10:22] <gnomefreak> clayg: no never
[10:22] <clayg> ok i got the beryl setting smanager up

[10:22] <clayg> lemme try something

[10:23] <jordo23> un_operateur: still there?

[10:23] <Jordan_U> clayg: If you don't have AIGLX or XGL installed beryl won't run
[10:23] <clayg> yeah how do you test that Jordan_U
[10:23] <un_operateur> soujiro, in my opinion, i find ddclient the best as it's simple to setup and easy to have a cron-job working
[10:24] <jordo23> un_operateur: I did all the instructions and should have a simple chroot setup...
[10:24] <Jordan_U> clayg: Have you done anything to install AIGLX or XGL? If you had you would know.

[10:27] <Jowi> clayg, did you modify /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf-custom?
[10:27] <un_operateur> jordo23, ok, can you verify if konqueror has a plugins directory -- i dont use knoq so bear with me -- i think - ls -l /usr/lib/knoqueror

[10:44] <Azul> selah, freedom of choice i think
[10:44] <Jowi> patrick_, start "gnome-colume-control" and go to capture tab and untick that little red cross on the mic. then turn the volume meter of it way up.
[10:44] <Jordan_U> barata: In what way?
[10:45] <ademan> gkjones_: i suppose it could work with xgl
[10:45] <selah> Always a good reason Azul. Just trying to understand as a noob. :)
[10:45] <noiesmo> Azul, yes its much better has got me out of a bind a few times when apt-get just couldn't get it
[10:45] <un_operateur> Azul, I wouldnt call aptitude's ncurses interface graphical -- and it also has a command line interface almost fully compatible with apt-get
[10:45] <barata> you just cannot chroot and fix the grub after windoz stole it ....
[10:45] <patrick_> jowi, i have done that but still nothing

[10:45] <ubotu> metacity: A lightweight GTK2 based Window Manager. In component main, is optional. Version 1:2.16.3-0ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 385 kB, installed size 764 kB
[10:45] <ub12> can some one remind me how to get a gpgkey for apt or synaptic?
[10:45] <barata> for sure using that 6.0.6 live CD just doesnt work
[10:45] <magez_> should i remove older tcl & tk packages first?
[10:45] <Jowi> patrick_, and if you click on the Options tab. what is the input source?
[10:45] <jordo23> un_operateur: It says it wants to install a ton of files, like 184 MB worth, is this normal?
[10:45] <Jordan_U> !grub | barata Yes you can
[10:45] <ubotu> barata Yes you can: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[10:45] <patrick_> jowi, i only have 3 controls too. if i plug a mic and headphones in before i boot, it gives me a couple more options but still doesnt help
[10:45] <phr34ck> so nautilus is the file manager, metacity is the window manager ... Interesting.

[11:17] <selah> I have a question about how ubuntu does partitions on install. My default partition install put swap in an extended partition. PCLinuxOs insisted on a primary partition for swap. At least in my limited understanding of the situation. So I have 2 swap partitions. Can I safely get rid of one on this multiboot setup?

[12:04] <jordo23> un_operateur: What about line 11 (media)
[12:05] <un_operateur> jordo23, well, you'll need to compile your own lines for whatever you have in media .. but only if you want konqueror or other apps in the chroot to use these drives
