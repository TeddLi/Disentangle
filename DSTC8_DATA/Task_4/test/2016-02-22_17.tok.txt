<s> important !!! for now , you should continue to use java 8 because oracle java 9 is available as an early access release ( it should be released in 2016 )! you should only use oracle java 9 if you explicitly need it , because it may contain bugs and it might not include the latest security patches ! </s>
<s> icedtea should really work </s>
<s> <user> : btw i think they meant $( <user> <unka> ) only works if you have them side by side , and xargs for the other </s>
<s> <user> : you may want to use nano instead . vi/vim require reading some tutorial ( or going through vimtutor ) prior to editing . </s>
<s> yeah i gave you the ppa for java 8 </s>
<s> :) </s>
<s> has it added it to the ppa list ? </s>

<s> <user> _ is now known as <user> </s>

<s> readlink -f `which java` </s>
<s> i 'm working on an ubuntu remix live cd , i have it mostly working except on bootup i get a number of authentication failure messages and no console or login prompt . does anyone know how to fix this ? </s>
<s> it should reveal exact path as <user> suggested </s>
<s> so we can add it to your java home </s>
<s> URL/http:/ <unka./> <unk#a/> </s>
<s> <user> : how did you install java ? and is this openjdk ? all i needed to do was install openjdk-8-jre and then run the jar </s>
<s> ( although technically , i run it through <unka> since i like lots of mods ) </s>
<s> no its oracle 's . we had no luck getting minecraft working with open jdk </s>
<s> <user> : check firefox releases notes ? wikipedia history release ? </s>
<s> can run using " java -jar <path to > DIR/minecraft.jar/ </s>
<s> <user> gave me a walk through and all seemed to work but the game will still not open </s>
<s> had to install oracle jdk for him </s>
<s> sorry , " java -jar <path to > DIR/minecraft.jar/ " ( without quotes ) </s>
<s> <user> , i mean when it made its way to ubuntu . </s>
<s> <user> : was there an error ? what version of minecraft ? it should work fine with openjdk </s>
<s> yeah that 's what i though ... no <user> did n't specify the error </s>
<s> <user> , i want to compare the release dates of the offical sites of firefox to the dates of some distros </s>
<s> anyway should be there configuring this ... we just need to set $java_home environment variable </s>
<s> so i 've asked <user> to run : readlink -f `which java` </s>
<s> to find out what the install path is </s>
<s> <user> : what about trying to uninstall it and then install openjdk or oracle java again ? </s>
<s> </s>
<s> its installed fine i think its just a matter of configuring java_home now </s>
<s> it says this DIR/usr/ DIR/lib/ DIR/jvm/ <unk#a-/> DIR/jre/ DIR/bin/ DIR/java/ </s>
<s> good ok now copy that exactly into your clipboard </s>
<s> and now run export <unk#a-/=_> </s>
<s> anyone ? i do n't use ubuntu and could really use some help here :d </s>
<s> clipboard .. ? lol </s>
<s> whatever ... ctrl +c </s>

<s> <user> : why ? </s>
<s> <user> , i was hoping to find the data i need online in the repos or some git ... </s>
<s> i pasted " export <unk#a-/=_> " and nothing happend </s>
<s> <user> , so i can compare how <unka/> software updates get into the different distros . </s>
<s> <user> : have you looked at URL/http:/ URL/packages.ubuntu.com/ ? it does n't give you the date but gives you the version </s>
<s> <user> : you specified the java binary as java_home </s>
<s> remove the " <unka/> " part </s>
<s> <user> : you can always ask , if it is not ubuntu related we can redirect so you get the help you need . ask your question . </s>
<s> that 's fine </s>

<s> <user> , <user> <user> on gentoo it was easy for firefox URL/https:/ <unka./> <unk#a-./=?> </s>
<s> just hit return key </s>
<s> 3 days </s>
<s> <user> : you'd need to go through the mailing list to get the upload dates i believe </s>
<s> then close down your terminal </s>
<s> and open it again </s>
<s> then try running minecraft </s>
<s> it should be set now </s>
<s> ... is it fine to specify it to the binary path ? could 've sworn that it had to be left out </s>
<s> <user> : if you're looking in the repos why could n't you use the timestamp of the package ? </s>
<s> <user> , there is no logging or git ? when it comes to ubuntu repos ? </s>
<s> <user> : what <user> said . that seems to be the best solution URL/http:/ URL/security.ubuntu.com/ <unka/> </s>
<s> <user> , i found this file URL/http:/ URL/us.archive.ubuntu.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> but there are not time stamps </s>
<s> <user> : look at the link i posted </s>
<s> negative . says the same thing :( </s>
<s> should i give up lol </s>
<s> <user> : closing and reopening the terminal wipes the export </s>
<s> yeah </s>

<s> well , should export it first and see if it works </s>
<s> only add it to .bashrc if it works </s>
<s> true </s>
<s> yeah repeat the export task again in bash terminal </s>
