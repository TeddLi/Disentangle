[14:03] <Amaranth> Zzeiss: I'm glad someone actually wants compiz. Usually people are telling me why they turned it off :P

[14:04] <drew212> anyone able to locate the application launchers on the filesystem for me? im having trouble
[14:04] <Zzeiss> Besides, I would much prefer to not run closed source.  I will make exceptions for things like the WiFi card, where frakking with the blob can cause major interference with other folks.
[14:05] <Amaranth> Zzeiss: Should have gotten a different laptop then :P
[14:05] <Amaranth> Zzeiss: blobtastic, that one is
[14:05] <Zzeiss> Amaranth: That's why I hang out on Nouveau and try to help there, to get rid of the binary blob.  Sadly, I am (*so*) far behind those guys that the most I can offer is encouragement.

[14:26] <Keiya> (I hate that phrase. This is my rebellion.)
[14:26] <ubottu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit

[15:08] <grawity> Rorty: You might want to try Ubuntuzilla - it'll update Firefox to the newest version.
[15:08] <Pici> Rorty: Not until the next release of Ubuntu, then it will be rebranded properly.

[15:32] <Whitor> jonaskoelker, thanks
[15:32] <Pici> Whitor: as LjL says, you can use nohup applicationame &
[15:32] <LjL> Whitor: man nohup
[15:33] <ubox> system404: and then will prompt you about a cert it recieved and you can view, decline, or accept
[15:33] <jonaskoelker> Whitor: in zsh, use "setopt no_hup"
[15:33] <Whitor> nohup cool
[15:33] <jonaskoelker> Whitor: ... in your .zshrc
[15:33] <Whitor> How do I tell what shell I'm runing ?
[15:33] <jonaskoelker> Whitor: nohup is good, but if you want to type less, set your shell up the right way :)

[15:33] <Whitor> bash
[15:34] <Whitor> thanks

[15:34] <brishu> quick question ... i installed Ubuntu using wubi so is there a way to increase the size Ubuntu takes .... without creating a dedicated partition for it???
[15:34] <joaopinto> the SHELL variable is expected to be set by the system when you log in
[15:35] <joaopinto> based on your login shell, setup on the system conf
[15:35] <Whitor> It seems ok to me to -always- untie & executed apps from the shell ...
[15:35] <joaopinto> and you are suggesting to change a file which specific to zsh, not bash

[15:42] <ubox> simplifier: i think you have to keep the menu. unless you switch desktop environments
[15:42] <thiebaude> simplifier, right click-delete this panel
[15:42] <ubox> why don't you want the panels?
[15:42] <grawity> simplifier: Or just kill gnome-panel

[15:44] <ubox> simplifier: you could tell it to auto hide, then it would still be there but you would not see it unless you put your cursor at the very top
[15:45] <_lover_> C compiler error when i am installing gnome-ppp
[15:45] <Pici> _lover_: install the build-essential package
[15:45] <simplifier> but it still occupy computer memory
[15:45] <Pici> _lover_: also, why are you compiling it? gnome-ppp is in the repositories

[15:46] <William-Ubuntu> hello
[15:46] <_lover_> C configure:2368: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[15:46] <ubox> simplifier: yes, perhaps you want to use enlightenment in place of metacity? it uses a rightclick menu instead of a bar. then you could have the gnome dock and a desktop click menu only
[15:46] <Pici> _lover_: Stop repeating.
[15:47] <_lover_> pici i ahve this problem
[15:47] <_lover_> i dunno why ?
[15:47] <Pici> _lover_: Did you read my responses?
[15:47] <jonaskoelker> _lover_: do you have gcc installed?

[15:47] <_lover_> what is it ?
[15:47] <stefg> !build
[15:47] <ubottu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first)
[15:48] <Pici> _lover_: 1) gnome-ppp is in the respositories, you shouldnt need to compile it. 2) if you do need to compile it, install the build-essential package first.
[15:48] <_lover_> so ho can i install gnome-ppp?

[15:51] <ubox> system404: if you wan not connect with the old one nor with the new protocol i am not sure what the problem is
[15:51] <LjL> _lover_: NO. they're saying that, in order to install gnome-ppp, you should ONLY type "sudo apt-get install gnome-ppp", and leave the tarball alone.
[15:51] <jonaskoelker> ^_^
[15:52] <ubox> simplifier: yes, it is a window manager. like metacity which is the defualt for gnome. enlightenment can be used instead. i believe it is http://www.enlightenment.org

[16:00] <KrimZon^> nor can i find wine
[16:00] <cheslyn> grawity: yep
[16:01] <foey> abhilashm86 : OK, currently you have a onboard intel graphics card, but you wish to use your nvidia card? What is ubuntu defaulting to?
[16:01] <grawity> cheslyn: Then boot in recovery mode.
[16:02] <cheslyn> grawity: how?
[16:03] <JMFTheVCI> I have lost the ability to use sudo. Every command gets an authentication error.

[16:05] <thiebaude> abhilashm86, have you installed the nvidia drivers?
[16:06] <foey> abhilashm86 : ah ok. I would put the nvidia card in and do a fail safe boot, then re-configure X
[16:06] <abhilashm86> thiebaude: no not yet, i need to disable intel graphics card
[16:06] <golem_> so i try to copy something with gftp and it makes a directory with permissions d------- that it can't even delete.
[16:06] <abhilashm86> foey: u mean without disabling intel?
[16:07] <foey> abhilashm86 : Yes, normally once a AGP/PCI-E card is added the onboard card is disabled.
[16:07] <foey> abhilashm86 : All you need to do then is failsafe and reconfigure the X server with the new card.

[16:36] <AaDi> they are running adnan
[16:36] <sipior> gwydionwaters: you might try "unzip", from the terminal. if nothing else, you might get a clearer error message.
[16:36] <adnan> AaDi, ok then do as fearful said
[16:37] <gwydionwaters> ok, i'll try that. i'm copying it over to my hdd first
[16:37] <adnan> AaDi, hopefully should fix the problem
[16:37] <sipior> gwydionwaters: might also simply be that the dvd is damaged
[16:37] <adnan> guys any body tried install hamachi or logmein on ubuntu ?
[16:37] <gwydionwaters> ok, but it worked a week ago o_O
[16:38] <tavelram> how can I have several different versions of the same program at the same time? eg rdesktop 1.6 and 1.5...
[16:38] <sipior> gwydionwaters: i'm sure it did.
[16:39] <gwydionwaters> sipior: lol is this a common problem?
[16:39] <genii> tavelram: Not usually, since the names of the binaries are the same
[16:39] <sipior> gwydionwaters: not to my knowledge.

[16:40] <gwydionwaters> sipior: i think osx's zips just suck. or the application 'burn'
[16:40] <tavelram> genii, yeah i know. at uni we have some program to handle that, but it would be nice if apt-get already had som functionality for that.
[16:40] <gwydionwaters> i made a more recent backup which will not work here or vista
[16:40] <AaDi> how to install non-free version of VirtualBox

[16:41] <AaDi> adnan, Ok
[16:41] <fearful> AaDi, have you tried killing all the processes and then re-opening it
[16:41] <genii> tavelram: You can have the main system use some version in the /bin or /sbin    and keep a local different copy in /home/yourname/bin   or so
[16:41] <AaDi> fearful, nope
[16:42] <adnan> AaDi, ok hold on
[16:42] <gwydionwaters> same error from console, end-of-central-directory not found
[16:42] <Somethingelse> :(
[16:42] <Somethingelse> I just installed ubuntu via the inside windows installation...
[16:42] <fearful> AaDi, adnan maybe before installing the non-free version just do ps axwww | grep virtual and kill the processes with virtual box
[16:42] <Somethingelse> now its stuck in the boot screen.
[16:42] <fearful> AaDi, then try and re open it
[16:43] <gwydionwaters> maybe if i clean it with a cd solution

[16:45] <DexterF> hi
[16:45] <Trizicus> I realize that however what are the compilers
[16:45] <AaDi> so
[16:45] <mamadpython> marius-, OK
[16:45] <adnan> AaDi, hold on
[16:46] <sipior> gwydionwaters: you might try accessing it from another machine. can you access the archive from the os x machine that wrote it?
[16:46] <AaDi> adnan, ok
[16:46] <marius-> Trizicus: sun-java6-jdk for java, gcc and build-essentials for c/c++
[16:46] <sipior> Trizicus: gcc and g++ will be your main staples.
[16:46] <gwydionwaters> i've removed it from my hdd
[16:46] <xTEMPLARx_> adnan:  I've used Logmein on windows PCs, but never on my linux boxes
[16:46] <marius-> that's the package names though
[16:46] <mamadpython> join ubuntu-ir
[16:46] <Trizicus> ok gcc and G++ for c/C++. What about the libs in /lib/ where can I find more info out about those
[16:46] <stefg> Trizicus: i think you should probably start by installing eclipse
[16:46] <adnan> xTEMPLARx, just tried installing hamachi which is logmein version for linux but not working
[16:46] <gwydionwaters> sipior: it does have some minor scratches in a bunch so i am going to try fixing them with a kit i have

[16:48] <AaDi> adnan, that's the open source version...i want the closed source
[16:48] <sipior> Trizicus: those are the standard C and C++ libraries. further library documentation is usually attached to whichever library packages you choose to install. also, consider installing the manpages-dev package. you're familiar with man pages?
[16:48] <AaDi> it contains a lot of features
[16:48] <Trizicus> yes
[16:49] <genii> tavelram: I'd suggest to make a custom apt.conf file which specifies all install dirs to be under your home dir, then call apt-get with the --config-file option. Use apt-config dump        to see what variables to set in your custom file
[16:49] <Trizicus> however i've never programmed in linux before and dont know where to start

[16:50] <adnan> AaDi, please follow the steps mentioned in link www.howtoforge.com/virtualbox_ubuntu
[16:50] <Trizicus> alright I also noticed that a lot of apps are distributed via cvs and svn where can I learn about using these to get source?
[16:50] <xTEMPLARx_> adnan:  the only logmein software I see is a beta or pre-release copy of a browser-based client

[16:51] <xTEMPLARx_> adnan:  i did find this page, but I'm not sure how current it is:  http://www.markmmanning.com/blog/2008/04/how-to-use-logmein-with-linux.html
[16:51] <sipior> Trizicus: google around for "subversion cvs howto" and the like. there is an enormous amount of material available for first-time users.

[16:54] <fccf> adnan: do you have administrator access to your router? if so it would be as easy as opening a port and using the remote desktop that is built into gnome which is called VNC the programs you would be using are vino for the server and vinagre as the client ... or you can use SSH tunnelling and X Forwarding .. which is a little more complicated
[16:54] <ab2qik> hi
[16:54] <Dr_Willis> jonaskoelker:  ive seen guides on swaping ctrl and caps lock.. (id say check google for those) then see if you can doit for any other  key codes...
[16:54] <stefg> Taejo: see the keyring manager in Applications/Accessories
[16:54] <Taejo> marius-: if I set it to my new password, it won't ask for any password?

[16:58] <elad`> flash what?
[16:59] <Psych0Pat> adobe flash
[16:59] <ab2qik> should i edit gdm.conf

[17:01] <fccf> ab2qik: not so difficult if you use pastebinit ... see !pastebinit
[17:01] <ab2qik> fccf, and im on vista on this channel
[17:01] <fccf> !pastebinit
[17:01] <ubottu> pastebinit is the command-line equivelent of !pastebin . Command output, or other text can be redirected to pastebinit, which then reports an URL containing the output. Simple usage: command-name | pastebinit
[17:02] <fccf> ab2qik: sudo apt-get install pastebinit
[17:02] <kielanmatt> hi guyz
[17:02] <ab2qik> fccf, so pastebinit can be done from shell
[17:02] <kielanmatt> is the frequency scaling governor?

[17:02] <fccf> ab2qik: yep
[17:02] <kielanmatt> a module
[17:03] <kielanmatt> is the frequency scaling governor a module
[17:03] <kielanmatt> like in modprobe
[17:03] <ab2qik> fccf,   in that case im on a dual boot machine and will go out of vista & into ubuntu.
[17:04] <gwydionwaters> how hard is it to recover files deleted from a hdd?

[17:06] <elad`> I've install the restricted flash. How do I get it working instead of the opensource thing?
[17:06] <kielanmatt> excuse me
[17:06] <kielanmatt> is the frequency governor a module i can blacklis?
[17:06] <xTEMPLARx> elad:  I would make sure via synaptics manager that ONLY the restricted flash was installed
[17:06] <stefg> elad`: have you had installed swfdec/gnash before?
[17:07] <sarutobi> Dr_Willis: but where? sh /home/lucjan/Pulpit/jurny-jarzabek-skrypt.sh for example
[17:07] <elad`> stefg, I don't know.
[17:07] <elad`> !Gnash
[17:07] <ubottu> An open source flash replacement.  It is still beta software. For current status or for more info http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/
[17:07] <stefg> elad`: then stop worrying ... everything works
[17:07] <Dr_Willis>  sarutobi  you can make a .sh executable and you dont need the sh ./whtever   at the front.
[17:07] <kielanmatt> ffs?
[17:08] <elad`> stefg, no. I'm getting the not-so-good opensource.
[17:08] <Dr_Willis> sarutobi:  make it executable then linkit whever ya want.. Or just put it in your users ~/bin/ dir and itwill be in your default path
[17:08] <tstebut> hi ?
[17:08] <elad`> stefg, the player I get is the opensource one. It's way less than satisfactory.
[17:08] <stefg> elad`: what is telling you that?
[17:08] <fearful> gwydionwaters, give me one second
[17:08] <elad`> I can see the same bugs as before I installed the restricted thing.
[17:08] <gwydionwaters> fearful: ok
[17:09] <stefg> elad`: sudo apt-get autoremove swfdec gnash
[17:09] <tstebut> Hello
[17:09] <Dr_Willis> Heh - No one ever actually uses the open sourced flashs tuff it seems
[17:09] <fccf> kielanmatt: 'sudo apt-get remove powernowd cpudyn'  will remove the userspace freq scaling ... more info here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=248867
[17:09] <fearful> gwydionwaters, how did you remove these files? rm
[17:09] <tstebut> How can I so if I have a root access without id nor su command available
[17:10] <Dr_Willis> tstebut:  ubuntu uses 'sudo' not 'su'
[17:10] <fccf> !sudo | tstebut
[17:10] <ubottu> tstebut: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (Gnome, XFCE), or !kdesudo (KDE)
[17:10] <sipior> Dr_Willis: no one, at least, who wants to actually watch flash media :-)
[17:10] <gwydionwaters> yep, accidental rm -R * /dir/* while in the root of my external, instead of rm -R /dir/*
[17:10] <elad`> Thanks. Boy, that's much better. Go closed-source software!
[17:10] <gwydionwaters> i was half awake lol
[17:10] <sarutobi> Dr_Willis: I can't do it ;/
[17:10] <sipior> gwydionwaters: ouch. hate to see that.
[17:10] <gwydionwaters> haha ya, me too
[17:11] <Dr_Willis> sarutobi:  clarify to the channel what you are wanting to do EXACTLY, and perhaps they can help. sounds like what you want to do is a rather trivial thing.. (but its my bed time)
[17:11] <gwydionwaters> that's the contents of my zip more or less. so i could recover somehow or fix the dvd, which is not to bad but my cd kit is cheap
[17:11] <kielanmatt> fccf : I dont have these packages and it still scles
[17:12] <LucidGuy> for some reason my amsn seems to not be able to connect to the msn network .. any ideas?
[17:12] <fccf> kielanmatt: the link I gave you has all of the modules listed, so you can blacklist them
[17:12] <loka_18> tas
[17:12] <adnan> LucidGuy, you can use pidgin, it will do the trick
[17:13] <gwydionwaters> fearful: i did find this http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlo17/howto/undelete_ext3.html  but it confuses me a bit
[17:13] <kielanmatt> where is that file for modprobe blacklist
[17:13] <LucidGuy> adnan, I've used pidgin...  find amsn better for msn networks
[17:13] <adnan> ok
[17:13] <tstebut> I'm affraid I don't have sudo...it's on a restricted system
[17:13] <fccf> kielanmatt: if it doesn't exist you can create it here /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[17:13] <tstebut> Linux indeed but minimal, very minimal
[17:14] <adnan> LucidGuy, try killing the process and running it again
[17:14] <Dr_Willis> tstebut:  then you may need to check with the admin about doing things that need root access..  Ubuntu sets up the first user as the 'admin; user with sudo rights'
[17:14] <kielanmatt> fccf: modprobe -r removes them too doesnt it
[17:14] <fccf> kielanmatt: only until you reboot
[17:15] <kielanmatt> i dont have the modules either
[17:15] <kielanmatt> says it cant find them
[17:16] <fearful> gwydionwaters, do you know how to search with grep?
[17:16] <gwydionwaters> no

[17:22] <harisund> ubuntujenkins, the dropbox forums might be a better place for that question
[17:23] <fccf> ubuntujenkins: what are you using to connect to dropbox?
[17:23] <ubuntujenkins> fccf the dropbox program from the dropbox website on my jaunty laptop
[17:24] <jered> thing that really sux is i had all my business emails and so forth on that partition and dont have a valid backup copy
=== eeexcidd3 is now known as eeexcid3
[17:25] <fccf> ubuntujenkins: have 2 user accounts in linux, switch back and forth
[17:26] <DuckGod> if i install linux while it has a intel network card in it will it not install right?like not install the grub?
[17:26] <ubuntujenkins> fccf one way around it I was thinking of a more seamless aproach, but that is the best sugestion yet
[17:27] <DuckGod> if i install linux while it has a intel network card in it will it not install right?like not install the grub?

[17:27] <tongueroo> hey guys, wondering, so when something gets compiled and built onto a system, eventually what results are binary files and executables, if i were to take the binary files and executables and copy them over to another system with the same architecture x86, would they just work?
[17:27] <tongueroo> im thinking about deployments and long compile times when i need to spin up a bunch of more servers
[17:28] <joaopinto> tongueroo, if you have the same libraries for which those binaries are linked to in the other system, yes
[17:28] <fccf> tongueroo: provided they are running the same kernel, have all necessarry libraries, and dependencies
[17:28] <joaopinto> tongueroo, why not just build the .deb packages ?
[17:28] <tongueroo> joaopinto : ic, actually we're on gentoo in production
[17:28] <tstebut> xTEMPLARx thank you
[17:29] <joaopinto> tongueroo, ah ok :\
[17:29] <tongueroo> which tends to build everything from source, hence the question
=== slamon is now known as LaMs
[17:29] <tongueroo> yeah, im in the wrong room :)
[17:29] <joaopinto> tongueroo, that might be a problem, don't expect library versions compatibility between gentoo and ubuntu
[17:29] <yanwei_> it's time for sleeping
[17:29] <joaopinto> tongueroo, you could setup an ubuntu chroot on the gentoo server
[17:29] <tongueroo> interesting, k, good to know, ive always have wondered that, just havent had the chance to try it out yet :)
[17:30] <huston> hey i have another question. in windows 64 bit vista if you install a program that is meant for a 32 bit system it goes into a special program files folder meant for 32 bit programs, does ubuntu 64 bit do anything similar to this?
[17:30] <joaopinto> huston, no, but you can install 32bits libraris so that you can most of the 32bits apps out there
[17:30] <joaopinto> run most
[17:31] <huston> ok. thx.
[17:31] <tongueroo> joaopinto: interesting, is chroot-ing similar to running vm's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot
[17:31] <joaopinto> tongueroo, well, kind of,, it is just virtualized in the filesystem structure sense
[17:31] <SeismicMike> I have vpnc and the Network Manager vpnc plugin installed and can successfully connect to my VPN, but cannot reach the outside Internet when I'm connected. Help? I'm running 9.04
[17:32] <joaopinto> but because on linux most of the resources are file structure based, yes, it behaves like a very light vm
[17:32] <tstebut> xTEMPLARx, If you still see me, do you know a way to know
[17:32] <xTEMPLARx> tstebut:  I'm sorry but i'm not familiar with your issue.  :(
[17:32] <tongueroo> ic, cool
[17:32] <tstebut> xTEMPLARx, If you still see me, do you know a way to know if I have root privilege on a device, without no su nor sudo nor id....
[17:32] <tstebut> Oh ok
[17:34] <Moae> hi all
[17:34] <dro> what is a good way to free up space on ltsp server
[17:34] <dro> i mean ubuntu desktop
[17:35] <acostello> can someone tell me how to change the default .wav player to vlc?
[17:35] <Moae> i have to remove LCDproc, to make a clean installation, what command i have to use to remove completely the software (i didn't install it with apt-get, i have compiled the packages)
[17:35] <torn> Right-click on it then go to Properties > Open With
[17:35] <fccf> acostello: System>Preferences>PreferredApplications
[17:36] <MoonlitFate> I accidentally deleted my SCIM icon and network connection icon from the top panel... does anyone know how I can get them back?
[17:36] <torn> fccf, "Preferred Applications" never works for me.
[17:37] <fccf> MoonlitFate: right click on the top bar... Add To Panel .. add the applets back
[17:37] <acostello> fccf: that didnt change it.
[17:37] <SeismicMike> How do I get vpnc to let me access the internet?
[17:38] <Moae> anyone can answer me? :)
[17:38] <gwydionwaters> anyone have any ideas on recovering rm'd files on ext3?
[17:38] <MoonlitFate> fccf: I would do that, if the applets were actually there, but they don't seem to be. :(
[17:38] <Madsy> Moae: sudo make uninstall && make clean? :-)
[17:39] <Madsy> Open the makefile and see what the targets are.
[17:40] <Madsy> Moae: Don't message people in private please. It's considered rude by some. Ask in the channel so everyone can benefit from the discussion.
[17:40] <sebsebseb> hi
[17:41] <fccf> MoonlitFate: Network moniter should be there ... as for SCIM .. there is a function in System>Preferences>SCIM Input Method Setup called GTK under Panel ....you should be able to do that from there
[17:42] <Moae> Madsy: sorry
[17:42] <Moae> Madsy where i have to launch the command?
[17:42] <geos64> oooooooooooooooooooooooooo GOD PLAEASE HELP ME
[17:42] <Madsy> Moae: In the build directory where the makefile is.
[17:42] <Madsy> You said you compiled the application yourself.
[17:42] <Moae> ok

[17:47] <fccf> 1024x768 is the correct
[17:47] <geos64> yes
[17:48] <fccf> geos64: you will probably need to install restricted drivers for your video card ... Do you know what kind of card you have, as in model number and make

[17:50] <ubottu> flucksbawks: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer).

[17:51] <stefg> flucksbawks: how then that you have oss installed ?
[17:51] <Two4> flucksbawks, you're running from the bash?
[17:51] <ubunoob> hello i have a little problem, i don't know how to change the password of my normal user, because i forgett it. im now connected with my su-account.
[17:52] <flucksbawks> Two4: well, its an HTPC that runs fluxbox,  but when I run mplayer from shell it tries all ao's, and fails miserably with all of them now
[17:52] <sebsebseb> ubunoob: ok that's easy enough to sort out
[17:52] <n8tuser> ubunoob-> passwd username
[17:52] <lizzzy> My speakers work perfectly but front headphones won't work.
[17:52] <flucksbawks> Two4: I install pulseaudio from source, and it didn't come with an uninstall script =P
[17:52] <sebsebseb> ubunoob: In the olden Ubuntu days would have to use a Live CD to sort that out,  but  not for the past few or so releases since recovery mode
[17:52] <flucksbawks> Two4: but alsa was still working after that for about 2-3 months
[17:53] <stefg> flucksbawks: have you checked lsmod that all your (alsa) kernel modules are loaded?
[17:53] <euxneks> flucksbawks: you should be able to make uninstall in your src directory

=== sale_ is now known as sale
[17:53] <Two4> flucksbawks, you lost me at HTPC
[17:53] <sebsebseb> ubunoob: boot it up from Grub, get the root shell, and passwd username, or use the Live CD
[17:53] <euxneks> flucksbawks: if you wanted to remove something your installed by src I mean
[17:53] <lizzzy> anyone?
[17:53] <flucksbawks> euxneks: I tried that, no target to uninstall
[17:53] <euxneks> d'oh
