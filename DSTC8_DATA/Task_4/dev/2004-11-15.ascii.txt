[12:22] <HrdwrBoB> tweaked: just one?
[12:22] <tweaked> HrdwrBoB: ok extended or primary?
[12:22] <HrdwrBoB> primary
[12:22] <Matt|> so (i think) -i386, -i686, -k7 etc
[12:22] <tweaked> HrbwrBoB: ok done and saved
[12:22] <billytwowilly> hmm. that's strange. synaptec gives me the wrong ones but on the command line it's all good;)
[12:22] <HrdwrBoB> excellent
[12:22] <HrdwrBoB> ok
[12:22] <billytwowilly> Thanks matt

[12:23] <Matt|> ah

[12:25] <billytwowilly> hmm. wtf? /bin/sh: line 1: gcc: command not found. I was certain I installed that..
[12:25] <bob2> billytwowilly: install build-essential
[12:25] <tuxx> However... I have in my rep. the install CD as source. Is it possible to have an online rep. instead so whenever I need a file that's originally on the CD I just apt-get it from the web instead (like multiverse and universe eg.)
[12:25] <Matt|> billytwowilly, not installed by default

[12:26] <billytwowilly> strangeness.
[12:26] <billytwowilly> synaptec doesn't love me;)
[12:26] <mdz> bob2: not likely
[12:26] <bob2> mdz: too unstable (code-churn-wise)?

[12:29] <tweaked> HrdwrBoB: is it mkdir /home/2nd
[12:29] <epod> Ubuntu is cuter. ;)

[12:30] <HrdwrBoB> |trey|: file a bug report as a feature request
[12:30] <|trey|> haha @ arrival "a long time ago" for Brian  :)
[12:30] <HrdwrBoB> tweaked: better off to mkdir /home/yourusername/2nd
[12:30] <HrdwrBoB> because /home is for user directories
[12:30] <HrdwrBoB> but it's up to you
[12:30] <ogra> SaintJerome: which device is you windows partition ?
[12:30] <epod> SaintJerome, mount -t ntfs /dev/hdX (where X is your windows drive) /mnt

[12:31] <SaintJerome> but i'd rather learn anyway
[12:31] <SaintJerome> thanks a lot
[12:31] <HrdwrBoB> tweaked: now, add a line to /etc/fstab (using possibly sudo gedit /etc/fstab)
[12:31] <|trey|> HrdwrBoB, would it be website related, or Firefox related?  :o
[12:31] <HrdwrBoB> |trey|: firefox
[12:31] <epod> SaintJerome, that presumes your windows drive is NTFS, by the way
[12:32] <SaintJerome> which it is

[12:37] <|trey|> HrdwrBoB, did you already have him edit /etc/fstab? else that wouldn't work...

[12:38] <bob2> Golo: nothing in the bts?
[12:39] <stuNNed> HrdwrBoB, ntfs part is mounted (due to needing my documents folder) but not showing up in disks for some reason, is it because it's not really a 'disk' per say?
[12:39] <HrdwrBoB> stuNNed: unmount it
[12:39] <tweaked> HrdwrBoB: /deb/hdb1 /home/myhomedir/2nd   ext3

[12:57] <HrdwrBoB> they are co-dependant

[01:08] <Safari_Al> Hi guys.  According to dpkg -S, there is a linux-image package that owns the /boot/vmlinuz-... file.  I need to use this package.  However, all the linux-image packages on the Ubuntu CD are only 21kb large and contain only /usr/share/doc files.  Where can I find the full package for a kernel-image?
[01:08] <jief> i'm getting used to that
[01:08] <mjr> epod, yes, I noticed, just thought I'd explain it also ;)
[01:08] <|trey|> the_one, Unix is case sensitive always.

[01:08] <aratdagnir> i mean the boot
[01:08] <aratdagnir> :)

[01:08] <the_one> that could be the problem....It's a lot easier to change OSes, than to change brain from win to linux. must....reformat....brain....
[01:08] <bob2> aratdagnir: or update-rc.d

[01:08] <bob2> ogra: or maybe g-s-t if you're using hoary
[01:09] <ogra> ;)
[01:09] <mjr> epod, that's probably just because fat doesn't support permissions so they can't be preserved

[01:29] <the_one> since I saw you guys talking bout gentoo, I remember one friend of mine had his pc perform some tasks in debian vs. his friend's pc in gentoo, and gentoo didn't come ahead, even if compiled/heavily optimized
[01:30] <|trey|> jief, why would you want to do that?
[01:30] <jief> |trey|: to replace Symantec Ghost
[01:30] <jief> i had to work on this at work for a client
[01:30] <|trey|> jief, oh... seems wierd  :o
[01:30] <jief> well, works well
[01:30] <jief> my system can be used to deploy any OS actually
[01:31] <jief> as long as it sports a supported FS
[01:31] <|trey|> jief, that sounds more useful... GPL?
[01:31] <jief> yeah
[01:31] <jief> i just packaged some already available software together. wrote the how-to
[01:31] <stuNNed> jief, supports mac fs as well?
[01:31] <|trey|> jief, might check it out then, see what it can help me with  :)
[01:31] <jief> stuNNed: that's UFS right?
[01:31] <HrdwrBoB> the_one: yeah, the 'optimise' thing is a wank

[01:33] <Pizbit> Pass on why they have fuses though.
[01:33] <|trey|> jief, HFS+ = a bridge between HFS and UFS, due to most tools in Darwin expecting UFS, and most Mac apps expecting HFS... very wierd setup but I guess it works...
[01:33] <stuNNed> jief, ok, might could use that in mac labs here at school, currently using netrestore which is limited to unicast
[01:34] <|trey|> jief, its funny, one is case sensitive, one isn't... must have been a lot of fun to fix that...
[01:34] <jief> |trey|: wait til MS releases WinFS, that's just plain weird
[01:34] <the_one> see you soon, thanks for the help
[01:34] <HrdwrBoB> jief: except that winFS has been pushed to not even be in longhorn

[01:34] <|trey|> jief, not really.. it just sits on top of NTFS, and holds meta-data for common file types... makes it easier to find shit...
[01:34] <stuNNed> cya the_one
[01:35] <djtansey> i have a problem re: k3b and am looking for some insight. cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc -audio -pad *.wav works when i have a directory of .wav files. but k3b doesn't work. it lists my CD/RW drive as "writes CDs: no" (though it says it writes cd/rws). any guesses?
[01:35] <jief> problem is, i haven't tried to image a machine with multiple partitions, but that could be done i'm sure
[01:35] <|trey|> s/$hit/stuff/ sorry
[01:35] <jief> you'd have to write a small bash script to create the partitions first i guess
[01:35] <stuNNed> jief, does it support multicast or unicast or both?
[01:36] <|trey|> jief, Novell is actually working on something very simular to WinFS as part of iFolder... seems interesting...  :)
[01:37] <|trey|> Can't for the life of me recall what it was called though... Simian I think maybe?
[01:37] <jief> |trey|: well, i have this promo DVD kit from novell. they have scripts to setup everything, exept LDAP. which bugs me to no end. i never came around to setup all their nice stuff because of that
[01:37] <jief> stuNNed: i believe it does
[01:37] <jief> but multicast generates too much traffic. i prefer unicast

[01:44] <bob2> that seems like overkill

[03:45] <djtansey> jdub: then any guess as to what the problem is?
[03:45] <Nafallo> jdub: that's with both ubuntu and debian kernels.
[03:45] <jdub> dunno if there's a FAQ or something on the website, but it would make sense to check
[03:45] <djtansey> jdub: i did. nothing i could find that was related

[03:46] <djtansey> jdub: other than some k3bsetup .ICEauthority issues
[03:46] <djtansey> Nafallo: but it works with 2.6.7 for you?

[03:46] <Nafallo> djtansey: yes.

[03:48] <jdub> i can only relate what i know

[03:48] <jdub> that may be true in your case

[04:45] <Pizbit> timello: You installed the w32codecs package eh? Tried changing from totem-gst to totem-xine ?
[04:46] <timello> Pizbit, just for mplayer... I' ll go try
[04:46] <Pizbit> (although personally I use xine)
[04:47] <timello> apt-get install xine-ui?

[04:49] <janice> Hi All! I took the plunge and installed Ubuntu. However, I need some help.
[04:49] <nomasteryoda> excellent
[04:49] <Nafallo> @ogre:/mnt/mirrors/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gnutls10$ ls -al

[04:49] <benh`> is it possible (or desirable) to dist-upgrade to hoary?
[04:50] <HrdwrBoB> benh`: yes and maybe
[04:50] <benh`> ok, just s/wart/hoary in sources.list?
[04:50] <timello> Pizbit, it comes with codecs?
[04:50] <nomasteryoda> HrdwrBoB: Ubuntu has given me excellent results with TVtime too
[04:50] <nomasteryoda> much better on my old wintv card
[04:50] <nomasteryoda> than mandrake
[04:50] <bob2> benh`: are you willing to deal with broken things and to file bug reports?
[04:50] <janice> I have an unsupported USRobotics wireless PCI card and I need to use ndiswrapper. Unfortunately, the install cd (Warty 4.10 Full Release) does not have ndiswrapper. What is the URL from the ubutnu website that I can download it from?
[04:50] <HrdwrBoB> heh
[04:50] <HrdwrBoB> good to hear :)
[04:51] <HrdwrBoB> janice: if you start synaptic
[04:51] <HrdwrBoB> and you enable 'restricted'
[04:51] <HrdwrBoB> you can install ndiswrapper
[04:51] <benh`> bob2, depends on how broken and yes
