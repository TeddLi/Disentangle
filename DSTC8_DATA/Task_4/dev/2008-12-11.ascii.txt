[08:24] <alfred_> yes I have
[08:25] <pb11> did it work/
[08:25] <alfred_> I've done it 3 or 4 times and it worked every time for me
[08:25] <wsgordon> jim_p__ where is the user name and password stored ?
[08:25] <skylarS> pb11, it's worked 9/10 or better for me
[08:25] <jim_p> wsgordon, dunno
[08:25] <pb11> nice
[08:25] <gnutron> jim_p: right, i agreed all along. not a symlink. i dunno i need sleep
[08:25] <skylarS> pb11, did it ever fail?  maybe not
[08:25] <wsgordon> It sucks ubuntu hates the dell optiplex.
[08:25] <pb11> would you recommend fragmenting my windows drive before reallocating some of the free space to ubuntu to improve the chances of success?
[08:25] <skylarS> wsgordon, vice versa
[08:25] <pb11> defragmenting
[08:25] <pb11> >>
[08:25] <pb11> sleep deprivation -_-
[08:25] <skylarS> pb11, sounds like a plan
[08:26] <pb11> lol
[08:26] <pb11> yeah
[08:26] <alfred_> yeah
[08:26] <kern> do it
[08:26] <wsgordon> i just know i will use ubuntu before I install vista... ;)
[08:26] <alfred_> back up important stuff, but I think it'll go smoothly
[08:26] <pb11> ok
[08:26] <gnutron> wsgordon: its encrypted in  /etc/shadow i think
[08:26] <pb11> Anybody here try Ubuntu Studio?
[08:27] <kern> i have so much hdd space that i never really had to worry about that i guess
[08:27] <Severian> wsgordon, I have Ubuntu installed on a bunch of Dell Optiplexes.  I have done it since Ubuntu first came out.  Dell uses such generic hardware that it works well.
[08:27] <skylarS> pb11, yeah, kind of sucks imho, sounds like a good idea though
[08:27] <alfred_> i've installed the studio kernel on top of a generic one
[08:27] <gnutron> wsgordon: install vista first to avoid grub stuff
[08:28] <alfred_> the main difference with ubuntu studio is that it includes lots of media editing apps, that's about it.
[08:28] <wsgordon> had vista installed, but I prefer to run a pure linux system, no duel boot
[08:28] <LeonSquall> is it possible to install a network printer from windows to ubuntu that is not supported inder ubuntu?
[08:28] <skylarS> alfred_, pb11 I think the real time kernel is the key, everything else is just flash and bloat that I can tell
[08:28] <LeonSquall> is it possible to install a network printer from windows to ubuntu that is not supported under ubuntu?
[08:28] <LeonSquall> cant find a site that explains if that is possible
[08:28] <alfred_> I've had bad luck with networking printers
[08:29] <LeonSquall> that's bad news
[08:29] <kern> wsgordon thats what i want and i kinda want to try installing windows on linux through vmware or wahtever so i dont have to duakboot
[08:29] <LeonSquall> for me
[08:29] <kern> dual*
=== Guest8078 is now known as Tux33
[08:29] <Tux33> can i use photoshop cs4 with wine?
[08:29] <skylarS> kern, if you have enough mem/proc you can vmware your existing windows partition
[08:30] <skylarS> that is pretty cool but this laptop is not beefy enough
[08:30] <pb11> What file system is better?
[08:30] <LeonSquall> so it's not possible to let windows do the translation on network printing
[08:30] <gnutron> wsgordon: no 'duel' boot is a pun ;)
[08:30] <skylarS> ext3
[08:30] <wsgordon> I've installed osx on a dell before, but when theres a install issue and the password fails, im stuck
[08:30] <kern> sKylarS hmm how much mem do i need?
[08:30] <LeonSquall> since the driver only suports windows
[08:30] <adv_> how can i check for a binary in which pkg it is?'
[08:31] <pb11> having a non-NTFS file system won't affect my ability to write to my windows partition will it?
[08:31] <skylarS> kern depends on the winduhs but over a gig for XP I would suppose
[08:31] <gnutron> kern: i have intrepid on a pentium 1.7 mhz 384 mb ram, runs great
[08:31] <alfred_> windows XP can function well on 512mb of ram, as long as you don't multi-task too much
[08:31] <kern> skylarS ive got 3
[08:32] <kern> nice
[08:32] <alfred_> I think the minimum requirment to install XP is 128mb
[08:32] <adv_> anyone?
[08:32] <DennisCollective> If Im not constantly pressing a key, ubuntu hangs on boot, but if I press a key it goes boots, same thing with shutdown, has anyone heard anything about this before?
[08:32] <gnutron> kern: 128 mb video card helps
[08:32] <kern> bot sure about my video card
[08:32] <skylarS> kern, yeah, if you have windows already installed it would be nice to VM into the existing partition, eh?  I bit tricky but I did it once
[08:32] <Tux33> can i use photoshop cs4 with wine?
[08:32] <PunyHuman> Hi, I have a problem with my wireless. It stopped working yesterday after a reboot... has beeb working fine for the last 6 months. I have an rt73usb wireless adapter. All other PC's in the house are fine. networkmanager reports that wireless is disabled, all the options are greyed out. 'dbus' detects the wireless adapter but I can't connect. Can someone please  help?
[08:33] <kern> skylarS it would be nice i dont even know how to vmware in the first place though
[08:33] <alfred_> PunyHuman, you're sure the adapter is powered on?
[08:33] <PunyHuman> alfred_: yes it is
[08:33] <jason_> hi all
[08:34] <jim_p> wsgordon, i cant find a proper chroot tutorial!
[08:34] <alfred_> hmm, well I don't know what to say with usb adapters
[08:34] <pb11> are the open source compilers for programming python and c++ any good?
[08:34] <kern> !vmware
[08:34] <ubottu> VMWare is not available in the Ubuntu repositories. Consider using !QEmu or !VirtualBox as alternatives. Instructions for installing VMWare manually are at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware
[08:34] <pb11> people have told me how awesome vim is
[08:35] <jason_> wow got to love it when you click callender in evolution and it just shuts down
[08:35] <bitmous1> <unconvertable> is there a command in openbox to start applications minimized?
[08:35] <wsgordon> I'm looking for the url to the site I read the optiplex has password issues on, but cannot locate it
[08:35] <alfred_> PunyHuman, it can see the network, right? If so, is your host using WPA?
[08:36] <skylarS> kern, http://www.squidoo.com/use-existing-windows-installation-and-apps-in-ubuntu
[08:36] <jason_> anyone have problems with flashing in opengl programs?
[08:36] <PunyHuman> alfred_: it is not a WPA problem, security makes no difference. when i left click on networkmanager, everything is greyed out. eth0 and the wireless are both greyed out. when i right click, "enable networking" is ticked and enabled, but "enable wireless" is greyed out and not ticked
[08:37] <skylarS> kern, i had to juggle a bunch of howto's but it only took me about an hour or so
[08:37] <kern> nice
[08:37] <alfred_> PunyHuman, could a recent update have affected the driver in any way?
[08:37] <kern> im sure it will take me longer haha
[08:37] <PunyHuman> alfred_: lsusb showsthe adapter, lsmod shows that the modules are loaded, dbus detects the hardware. it is some kind of networkmanager problem from what i can see
[08:37] <alfred_> well that's very strange
[08:38] <PunyHuman> alfred_: i have not done in any updates in about 2 weeks, pc has been rebooted in between.
[08:38] <paranoid_ndroid> I'd like to try to get the source from CVS
[08:38] <alfred_> I would try re-installing network manager, or using a different network manager
[08:38] <wsgordon> can you boot as root
[08:38] <pb11> what irc clients are good on ubuntu
[08:38] <kern> skylarS im using stata hdd's
[08:38] <PunyHuman> alfred_: i think I will try wicd
[08:38] <paranoid_ndroid> !cvs
[08:38] <ubottu> cvs is the Concurrent Versions System, the dominant open-source network-transparent version control system; it helps to manage releases and to control concurrent editing of source files among multiple authors. See: https://www.cvshome.org/
[08:38] <skylarS> kern, should be similar
[08:39] <PunyHuman> alfred_: i just plugged in my usb memory stick and nothing happened. it seems that no usb devices are working, even though dbus knows they are there
[08:39] <skylarS> linus torvalds loves CVS
[08:39] <PunyHuman> alfred_: could it have something to do with the fact that i disabled a few servics at boot time
[08:39] <adv_> what does it mean for apt not able to get v 80483e6:       56                      push   %esi
[08:39] <gnutron> wsgordon: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword  use 'the other way' listed in this document.
[08:39] <adv_> what does it mean for apt not able to get verification?
[08:39] <alfred_> PunyHuman, all I can say is that trying wicd sounds like a good idea. Reinstalling network manager is a good idea, too
[08:39] <TheoPast> i think windows is better
[08:39] <pb11> :O
[08:39] <pb11> here come the flames =\
[08:40] <paranoid_ndroid> is it too difficult?
[08:40] <alfred_> yay, lets start an argument about windows vs. linux
[08:40] <PunyHuman> alfred_: do you know which services control usb ? i used sysv-rc-conf and disabled some things i probably should not have
[08:40] <kern> alright ill try this
[08:40] <kern> later all
[08:40] <jamil> Hello! Firefox is crashing constantly on intrerpid
[08:40] <TheoPast> first of learn how to spell! and whats there to argue about
[08:41] <DaveKong> why might cplay using mpg123 jump from 1% or less cpu usage to 8% switching from gnome to lxde (openbox, lxterminal other recommended defaults)?
[08:41] <jim_p> jamil, hello. use flashblock for a start
[08:41] <jamil> flashblock ?
[08:41] <jim_p> jamil, yea. its a firefox addon
[08:41] <alfred_> PunyHuman, wicd is supposed to work a lot better for usb wireless devices. I would try that, and if it doesn't work, then it's a USB problem
[08:41] <gnutron> TheoPast: windows is ok if you spend thousands of dollars on software, but it sucks at networking.
[08:41] <jim_p> jamil, assuming that crashes are 99% flash faults
[08:41] <PunyHuman> alfred_: I have no way of getting wicd on to the pc... it is wireless only, and none of my usb thumb drives are being detected
[08:42] <paranoid_ndroid> how do I set an environment variable?
[08:42] <PunyHuman> alfred_: this seems to me more like a USB problem in general rather than a wireless issue
[08:42] <jamil> jim_p: should i install flashblock ?
[08:42] <alfred_> PunyHuman, I had the issue with having only a wireless card, and no others. I suppose you're right, it is a usb problem..
[08:42] <jim_p> PunyHuman, do you have internet connection on that pc? and DO NOT just download the .deb and install manually, use the repo!!!
[08:42] <adv_> what does it mean for apt not able to get verification for some pkgs?
[08:42] <jim_p> jamil, yea

[08:43] <zeno> got this error in tty1 (wasnt logged in) right before hard freeze: CIFS VFS: Unexpected lookup error: -112
[08:43] <jim_p> adv_, some authentication key for some repo is missing
[08:43] <PunyHuman> jim_p: no, it is wireless only. the router is 300m away
[08:43] <adv_> jim_p: is it dangerous?
[08:43] <alfred_> PunyHuman, you could try booting into a LiveCD and testing wireless/USB functionality there
[08:43] <PunyHuman> alfred_: who can help me with my usb problem them
[08:43] <jim_p> PunyHuman, do you have internet connextion now?
[08:43] <gnutron> paranoid_ndroid: /etc/environment or /etc/profile i think. ive used both, those are global settins be aware
[08:43] <Acedip> jamil: gettting the updates might help overcome it, assuming u installed a downloaded version of intrepid from torrents..
[08:43] <adv_> jim_p: is it often ?
[08:43] <TheoPast> hay alfred saigh whuts up to bruce four me
[08:43] <PunyHuman> alfred_: It works fine. it is something that I have done to my system which is causing it not to work
[08:43] <jim_p> adv_, depends on the repo, and no its not often
[08:43] <PunyHuman> alfred_: livecd works fine but does not help me solve the probem
[08:44] <PunyHuman> jim_p: yes, obviously
[08:44] <jamil> Acedip: I has feisty which i upgraded to intrepid directly
[08:44] <wsgordon> gnutron thanks ill give it a try
[08:44] <jim_p> PunyHuman, well use the wicd repo to install it!
[08:44] <PunyHuman> jim_p: I am using a different PC
[08:44] <jim_p> lol
[08:44] <jamil> Acedip: but firefox was running fine till yesterday
[08:44] <paranoid_ndroid> gnutron, what is the command? export?
[08:44] <alfred_> PunyHuman: I don't know anything about usb nonfunction
[08:44] <Acedip> jamil: ohh..
[08:45] <jim_p> jamil, feisty > intrepid at once? or feisty > hardy > intrepid ??
[08:45] <PunyHuman> does anyone know why usb is just simply not working??? dbus sees the hardware but none of it will do anything... storage devices, wireless adapters. surely someone has had this happen to them before!
[08:45] <gnutron> adv_: it means you dont have the pgp key installed
[08:45] <jamil> jim_p: at once
[08:45] <jim_p> PunyHuman, lsusb
[08:45] <jim_p> jamil, no wonder why. you jumped from ff2 to ff3
[08:45] <PunyHuman> jim_p: it shows all of the devices....
[08:46] <gnutron> paranoid_ndroid: i think its 'set' then 'export
[08:46] <PunyHuman> jim_p: /dev/sdb1 is normally my usb stick. If I try to mount, it says special device does not exist. even though it shows up in lsusb
[08:46] <jim_p> PunyHuman, does dmesg say anything when you plug sth in?
[08:46] <jamil> jim_p: infact this page crashes  firefox: http://blendernewbies.blogspot.com/search/label/Topology
[08:46] <paranoid_ndroid> gnutron, do you have an example?
[08:46] <TheoPast> "(03:43:08 AM) alfred_: don't tell anybody, but i really like the new vista program, but if u still wanna meet me for drinks id really like that..." wtf?
[08:46] <PunyHuman> jim_p: yes, it shows that it has detected everything
[08:46] <adv_> gnutron: how can i install it?
[08:47] <paranoid_ndroid> reboot
[08:47] <jamil> jim_p: firefox is still crashing(after installing flashblock)
[08:47] <gnutron> paranoid_ndroid: havent done that for quite awhile, i'll take a look though
[08:47] <jim_p> jamil, it doesnt for me!
[08:47] <jim_p> jamil, ff does crash for me on some sites like    www.insomnia.gr/forum
[08:48] <Acedip> jamil: got damnit..what was that page..even mine's gone
[08:48] <maco> jim_p: i think the proper question wouldve been feisty->gutsy->hardy->intrepid
[08:48] <jamil> Acedip: no that site is trusted one
[08:48] <jim_p> maco, i missed an alphabet letter
[08:48] <gnutron> adv_: the repo site should show how to wget the key and import it using tee to install it in root's keyring
[08:48] <jim_p> jamil, it does not crash at the main page though
[08:48] <PunyHuman> ?
[08:49] <jamil> jim_p: all other pages are opening normally
[08:49] <adv_> gnutron: it's the same repo i always use
[08:49] <jim_p> jamil, try cleaning the cache
[08:50] <jim_p> jamil, and as last resort, use opera for that site
[08:50] <gnutron> adv_: do you get a warning?
[08:50] <Acedip> just out of curiosity guys..how many websites are there on the internet
[08:50] <paranoid_ndroid> it worked just with export
[08:50] <paranoid_ndroid> thanks gnutron
[08:50] <Acedip> not the webpages though..
[08:50] <alfred_> I think there's over 100 million websites
[08:51] <gnutron> paranoid_ndroid: ok, heres a cmd line or two actually- NNTPSERVER='netnews.mchsi.com'
[08:51] <bitmous1> anybody know where swiftfox keeps it's configuration files for each user?
[08:51] <gnutron> export NNTPSERVER
[08:51] <Eredor> hi, i just installed ubuntu on my hp pavilion dv 9000, i've enabled the restricted drivers by nvidia but still cannot increase my screen resolution

[08:51] <adv_> gnutron: not the other times
[08:52] <Eredor> also, i can't remember any terminal commands from the short period i used it about a year ago >_<
[08:52] <Acedip> alfred_: url ?
[08:52] <jim_p> bitmous1, in ~/.swiftfox maybe?
[08:52] <jamil> jim_p: from where can i get opera ?
[08:53] <Eredor> can anyone help me please?
[08:53] <gnutron> adv_: regular ubuntu repo's i dont recall needing to install the signing key.
[08:53] <bitmous1> jim_p: isn't there strangely enough, on either of my accoutns
=== Teiseii is now known as Teisei
[08:53] <jim_p> jamil, open up /etc/apt/sources.list and add the opera repo. then use synaptic for the rest

[08:53] <jim_p> vertx, select a session
[08:54] <Acedip> but alfred_: that figure is as of feb 2007..its 22 now months after that
[08:54] <Mud|afk> can somone explain how to put permission to the subfolders also?
[08:54] <vertx> jim_p: Do you mean the session wasn't automatically selected?
[08:54] <Mud|afk> with chmod it does only main folder
[08:54] <jim_p> Mud|afk, chown -R
[08:54] <jim_p> or chmod -R
[08:54] <Mud|afk> ty :)
[08:55] <Mud|afk> thanx \o/
[08:55] <Spark> it seems that ibex's nvidia support now ignores vsync
[08:55] <jim_p> not sure if its R or r Mud|afk
[08:55] <Mud|afk> I think r
[08:55] <Spark> __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK now has no effect
[08:55] <gnutron> Mud|afk: chmod -R 755 dir/  for example
[08:55] <Spark> the glx support doesn't do anything
[08:55] <theeclipse> Hello guys, How can I change my external drive filesystem without losing my data?
[08:55] <Spark> and nvidia-settings doesn't work either
[08:55] <Mud|afk> ok gnutron :>
[08:55] <Mud|afk> second question
[08:55] <Mud|afk> I have host allow in my samba share
[08:55] <jamil> Is chrome available for ubuntu ?
[08:56] <jim_p> theeclipse, you move the data to a safe place and format it to the new filesystem. other methods have non guaranteed results
[08:56] <Mud|afk> but..I want a short ip range exampe 10.35.39.20- 10.35.39.40 in there
[08:56] <Mud|afk> how I do that?
[08:56] <jim_p> jamil, no. unless you want to run it in wine
[08:56] <finiras> is there a command that i can run to see if this server can handle SATA hdds
[08:56] <Mud|afk> 10.35.39.20-40 isnt working?
[08:56] <theeclipse> jim_p: not even gparted ?
[08:56] <jim_p> theeclipse, nope
[08:56] <gnutron> Mud|afk: i know nothing about samba configs, sorry.
[08:57] <Mud|afk> too bad :(
[08:57] <jim_p> finiras, does it have sata ports? and sata drives?
[08:57] <theeclipse> jim_p: I have lotof problems to make it writable under Debian because it is VFAT, then I thought maybe it is better I change its filesystem, any idea?
[08:57] <gnutron> Mud|afk: 10.35.39.0/24 maybe i dunno
[08:58] <jim_p> theeclipse, well vfat is as is writable and readable by any os!
[08:58] <Mud|afk> gnutron: I want a short list only, only servers must access the share
[08:58] <bitmous1> anybody know where swiftfox keeps it's bookmarks etc for each user?
[08:58] <jim_p> theeclipse, where does debian fail?
[08:58] <Mud|afk> 20-40 is the server ip range
[08:58] <Mud|afk> servers*
[08:58] <jim_p> bitmous1, are they different than ff bookmarks?
[08:59] <gnutron> Mud|afk: no samba experience for me.
[08:59] <Mud|afk> gnutron too bad :( I find nothing with google :o >.<
[08:59] <theeclipse> jim_p: It mounts it but the problem is that non-root users do not have permission of write, and plus I can not change its file permissions even by root
[08:59] <finiras> jim_p it doesnt have SATA drives, but the thing is, i have this server that is far from me at the mo and i was gonna buy a new hard drive for this, so i need to know if there are any SATA ports. I have SSH access
[08:59] <bitmous1> jim_p: I dunno but I do know when I open it up as root and when I open it up as my user I get two completely different sets of bookmarks etc
[08:59] <fy> hiiiialllllll
[08:59] <jim_p> theeclipse, can you use an fstab entry for that?
[08:59] <jim_p> hey one at a time!
[08:59] <gnutron> Mud|afk: samba.org
[09:00] <finiras> jim_p i do remember somebody telling me some time ago that it does support SATA but i dont want to risk buying it for nothing
[09:00] <jim_p> finiras, lshw will tell
[09:00] <jim_p> i think
[09:00] <theeclipse> jim_p: this is my entry for the drive : users,iocharset=utf8,exec,rw,nosuid,nodev,umask=002,uhelper=hal,utf8,shortname=winnt,uid=1000,gid=1000
[09:00] <finiras> thx, ill try
[09:00] <MrSoundless> hi all I have a rm question
[09:00] <fy> gnutron hi
[09:00] <MrSoundless> I got a folder with LOTS of files and if I try to remove all with rm *.* it tells me the list is too long
[09:00] <MrSoundless> any idea how else I can remove all files
[09:00] <fy> > ompaul   hiiiiiii
[09:00] <jim_p> bitmous1, thats correct. root user and your user are different accounts
[09:01] <danaka> holy shit... how many files do you have in that folder
[09:01] <MrSoundless> lots of thousands of files
[09:01] <ompaul> fy, h
[09:01] <bitmous1> jim_p: right, so I figure the config files, bookmarks etc would be in the home directories of each user, but so far i can't find em
[09:01] <fy> > ompaul  hiiiiiiiiiiiii
[09:01] <fy> how are you?
[09:01] <fy> are you a man?
[09:01] <MrSoundless> any idea how I can get rid of those? :P
[09:02] <gnutron> theeclipse: heres my fstab entry- /dev/sdb1 /media/LOCAL_DISK vfat rw,nosuid,nodev,shortname=mixed,uid=1000,utf8,umask=077 0 0
[09:02] <theeclipse> gnutron: Thanks man I will try it now
[09:02] <jim_p> theeclipse, have you tried setting 2 parameters for this in fstab? defaults,iocharset=utf8
[09:02] <fy>  nirina  hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[09:02] <Zealot12> Good morning
[09:02] <MrSoundless> gm
[09:02] <fy> how are you?
[09:03] <theeclipse> jim_p: it is the exact line that I copied from my fstab

[09:03] <Zealot12> Im doing okay. I am having some xconfig issues...serious ones it seems lol
[09:03] <vertx> will somebody kick the troll
[09:03] <theeclipse> gnutron: I chown the mount point first but after mount it changes it to root
[09:03] <jim_p> theeclipse, ok. comment it out and try with these 2 options i gave you
[09:04] <krish> how can i implement firewall on my webserver? I am using ubuntu 8.04 server edition with LAMP.
[09:04] <adv_> what pkg do i need for gtk+-2.0?
[09:04] <gnutron> theeclipse: setuid to your uid
[09:04] <paranoid_ndroid> after all the software used svn
[09:04] <Zealot12> Whenever I try to use the sudo /etc/X11/xorg/conf to change my driver settings, it says "ERROR: Unable to write to directory '/etc/X11'" Then if I type nvidia-xconfig, it says "Using X configuration file "/etc/X11/xorg.conf  WARNING: The CorePointer device was not specified explicitly in the layout; using the first CorePointer in the config input list" I dont know whats going on, but I even think my comp is running slower. Any ideas
[09:04] <paranoid_ndroid> it seems a lot simpler...
[09:04] <fasta> Will anything bad happen if I launch 1000 tar processes in about a second? I.e. will I get some kind of error message?
[09:05] <vertx> krish: use shorewall or firestarte, unless you're proficient with iptables
[09:05] <ocRob> fasta: try it
[09:05] <hc> fasta, are you trying to see what happens if you launch a fork bomb?
[09:05] <fasta> hc: no
[09:05] <visof> hi
[09:05] <gnutron> theeclipse: then sudo chown you:root /media/disk
[09:05] <whuffor> MrSoundless: You could try something like this to remove all files from the current directory: find . -name '*' -exec rm {} \;
[09:06] <jim_p> has anyone tried fwbuilder? i think is a bit more user friendly than firestarter
[09:06] <gnutron> Zealot12: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:06] <vertx> jim_p: I use shorewall myself
[09:06] <finiras> jim_p any idea how i can see the output of lshw when its too long for the screen of putty to hold
[09:07] <gnutron> Zealot12: or editor of choice
[09:07] <userbn> yes
[09:07] <jim_p> finiras, dump it on a file like so                lshw > output.txt
[09:07] <jim_p> finiras, or use more to view it page after page                 lshw | more
[09:07] <finiras> thx jim_p, does that stuff work with most output commands?
[09:08] <AdvoWork> how can i kill a process if I have it's id?
[09:08] <jim_p> finiras, yea
[09:08] <jim_p> AdvoWork, killall id
[09:08] <jim_p> i think
[09:08] <theeclipse> jim_p: It doesnt work
[09:08] <gnutron> finiras: lshw > some-filename   then open the file in an editot
[09:08] <MrSoundless> whuffor: ty, I found it, I just did rm -rf dirname and removed the complete dir :P
[09:08] <theeclipse> gnutron: I can not chwon it even by root !!
[09:08] <Mud|afk> gnutron: I will join the samba channel for that channel ;)
[09:08] <Mud|afk> for that question*
[09:09] <paranoid_ndroid> is there anyway to paste from firefox to a terminal?
[09:09] <gnutron> theeclipse: it must be mounted first
[09:09] <paranoid_ndroid> directly
[09:09] <acasla> anyone know why an 8.10 livecd boots on my macbook, but not my acer?
[09:09] <whuffor> MrSoundless: Glad you solved it
[09:09] <MrSoundless> ty for the answer though :)
[09:09] <whuffor> As a rule, the find command is very useful
[09:09] <whuffor> Well worth learning
[09:09] <theeclipse> gnutron: Yes I know, # chown behdad:root external/
[09:09] <theeclipse> chown: changing ownership of `external/': Operation not permitted
[09:09] <jim_p> acasla, is the acer laptop on ati?
[09:10] <mrglinux> hi I have ubuntu 8.04 on my server but I have problem with install some package that I need you can see here http://phpfi.com/387271
[09:10] <gnutron> theeclipse: thats 'chown' btw
[09:10] <theeclipse> gnutron: lol, man it was a typo
[09:10] <gnutron> theeclipse: an external drive eh?
[09:11] <acasla> jim_p, the acer has an nvidia geforce 8600m
[09:11] <visof> hello , something strange occurred in the above bar in the screen in gnome
[09:11] <mrglinux> I install each one but I have problem also
[09:11] <visof>  i was able to put a lot of the running application on this bar
[09:11] <AdvoWork> ive got: rsync      2493       root  cwd   unknown                                 /home/ZimbraBackups (stat: No such device or address)  ive done: kill 2493 and its still there??
[09:11] <theeclipse> gnutron: yes
[09:11] <visof> like pidgin, xchat
[09:11] <visof> in the right direction
[09:11] <mrglinux> any soultion ?
[09:11] <visof> now i can't do this i don't know what is the problem ?
[09:12] <visof> is there anyone understanding me ?
[09:12] <gnutron> theeclipse: i dunno
[09:12] <theeclipse> gnutron: Thanks man.
[09:12] <calliope> mmmmm gee it feels like I dont even have the right words for my question..   Where/How do I update the list of package sources so that the Update Manger can find the unfound deb files
[09:12] <theeclipse> jim_p: Thank you.
[09:12] <finiras> err whats that command line text editor called again
[09:12] <calliope> ok so I found a software sources in the add/rem apps -> then preferenc
[09:12] <gnutron> theeclipse: it is mounted right?
[09:13] <calliope> so now where do I find proper source address?
[09:13] <gnutron> theeclipse: type 'mount'
[09:13] <theeclipse> gnutron: Yes I can mount it, the problem is that other users can not write on it, even by root I can not change its ownership and persmission
[09:13] <mrglinux> apt-get install libberkeleydb-perl == The following packages have unmet dependencies:   libberkeleydb-perl: Depends: perlapi-5.8.8   E: Broken packages  :-(
[09:13] <mrglinux> but perlapi-5.8.8 is installed
[09:14] <Zealot12> gnutron: Thanks so much man! So I can now go in and rectify the situation...it was using the wrong driver. The "nvidia" driver, I have an old intel graphics chip so that was *not* gonna fly lol
[09:14] <gnutron> theeclipse: hrm, chmod 755 it first maybe
[09:15] <theeclipse> gnutron: It is 755 by default
[09:15] <finiras> can anybody name a good command line text editor
[09:15] <theeclipse> finiras: VIM
[09:15] <whuffor> ed or ex had been around forever
[09:15] <whuffor> *has
[09:16] <gnutron> finiras: nano is easy, vi is powerful, emacs same thing
[09:16] <finiras> rite thx
[09:16] <gnutron> vi aka vim
[09:16] <whuffor> those are fullscreen editors though. The question was for a command line editor
[09:17] <theeclipse> finiras: btw if you are under ubuntu why dont you use GEDIT ?
[09:17] <Scix> Is it posible to preconfigure WPA securitysettings in the interface file?
[09:17] <amdpox> well, I'm guessing he just wants a CLI editor, whuffor
[09:17] <whuffor> Mmm. Possibly
[09:17] <finiras> theeclipse no im approachign a ubuntu server using SSH
[09:17] <Scix> Can't find anything while googleing..
[09:17] <whuffor> You can't always use a gui editor if you for instance connect via ssh or something.
[09:17] <finiras> its been long since i did this stuff, forgot most of the commands
[09:17] <yourface> HEY!!!
[09:17] <theeclipse> finiras: Then use SSH -X
[09:18] <dnyy> Is envyng still useful in Ubuntu 8.10?  Every mention of it seems geared toward 8.04
[09:18] <ActionParsnip> yo yo yo
[09:18] <nnooplo_> #linuxac
[09:18] <whuffor> theeclipse: Why use a gui if you don't have to?
[09:18] <ActionParsnip> dnyy: I use it
[09:18] <yourface> FUCK YOU
[09:18] <dnyy> :x
[09:18] <finiras> theeclipse im using putty from a windows machine
[09:18] <gnutron> Zealot12: read that file, note the dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver.xorg command
[09:18] <theeclipse> whuffor: Well it is harf to start with VIM, it was just a suggestion
[09:18] <amdpox> finiras, then you'd need special software if you wanted to use X forwarding over ssh
[09:18] <amdpox> XMing I think it's called
[09:18] <dnyy> ActionParsnip: Well when it asks me to pick a driver, only one shows up.  I'm guessing it's the correct one?  I really don't want to mess anything up. :x
[09:18] <amdpox> nano is probably the easiest course
[09:19] <theeclipse> finiras: Then as mentioned above, VIM or Nano
[09:19] <whuffor> theeclipse: making gui work over a network in a secure way isn't that easy either :)
[09:19] <acasla> VIM was the first editor I ever used, from my noob days. It's not too hard, I think
[09:19] <ActionParsnip> dnyy: just instal the driver with auto hardware detection and it'll install what it needs, make sure you run the app with gksudo
[09:19] <finiras> amdpox, X forwarding? you mean like send a file from that pc to the one im on now?
[09:19] <acasla> i agree that nano is easier than VIM
[09:19] <theeclipse> whuffor: Oh alright man ;)
[09:19] <ActionParsnip> +1 nano
[09:19] <amdpox> finiras, no, it lets you run GUI apps remotely
[09:19] <hc> whuffor, actually ... if you know how to use SSH tunnels its very easy.
[09:20] <dnyy> ActionParsnip: I'm running Xubuntu and gksudo/gedit seem to never do anything. Is there a xfce alternative or something?
[09:20] <ActionParsnip> dnyy: sudo apt-get install gksudo maybe (?)
[09:20] <whuffor> hc: Agreed, but you have to learn it first. It can be very convenient
[09:20] <theeclipse> dennda: MousePad ?
[09:20] <finiras> amdpox i know how it works thx. ive done this a lot before only it was a long time ago so i forgot the names
[09:20] <amdpox> dnyy, mousepad is the text editor
[09:20] <hc> whuffor, i use it to administrate a bunch of pc's at school, so yeah, it's really easy.
[09:21] <Severian> dnyy, You can install gedit on xfce.  It installs pretty easily.  I assume gksudo would not be bad, but I have not tried that.
[09:21] <ActionParsnip> dnyy: according to one post, xfce uses gtk too
[09:21] <theeclipse> gnutron: Anyway thanks man!
[09:21] <whuffor> hc: I think it's great too. My objection was just that learning how to do that just to use a graphical editor instead of a text editor seemed like overkill and not necessary
[09:21] <gnutron> theeclipse: welcome
[09:21] <dnyy> Severian: Ah, alright then.  It not coming preinstalled had me confused as to if I should install it or not. :p
[09:22] <amdpox> xfce is gtk-based, but I think gedit has gnome deps
[09:22] <ActionParsnip> amdpox: im just trying to give him graphical sudo
[09:22] <ddoom> how do I disable gdm from starting onboot, without removing it
[09:22] <Photoguy> I try to load Rosetta stone using wine vitual desktop, but it says "please insert the correct cd"
[09:23] <dnyy> Well it seems there isn't a gnome-based GUI at the moment. :/
[09:23] <Severian> dnyy,  xfce has most of the libraries that gedit needs already.  You just add the app.  I always do that on xubuntu.  xubuntu is very nice on my P2/366.  Enjoy it.
[09:23] <ActionParsnip> Photoguy: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?appId=1867
[09:24] <amdpox> ddoom, install bum and disable the service
[09:24] <hc> whuffor, that's a good point.
[09:24] <dnyy> Severian: I do, it runs a lot better with 512MB of RAM than gnome/kde.
[09:24] <dnyy> So if there's no GUI for this, I'm assuming sudo will do just fine?
[09:24] <ActionParsnip> dnyy: you run: gksudo envyng-gtk
[09:25] <amdpox> dnyy, running graphical apps with plain sudo can lead to issues
[09:25] <Photoguy> Thanks I'll try that.
[09:25] <gnutron> ddoom: you use invoke.rc.d i believe, ask jack sparrow  that question
[09:26] <amdpox> Photoguy, do you have a language pack CD in?
[09:26] <Photoguy> Yes :)
[09:26] <amdpox> In the physical drive?
[09:26] <Zealot12> gnutron: it says "Package 'xserver.xorg' is not installed and no info is available" hmmmm
[09:26] <Photoguy> Yes
[09:26] <ddoom> gnutron: k
[09:26] <dnyy> ActionParnsip: It's saying there isn't a GUI, though, other than one for KDE.
[09:26] <amdpox> hmmm, I got rosetta working, lemme try to remembe rhow
[09:27] <Photoguy> Ok
[09:27] <Photoguy> It odes the same with BF2
[09:27] <gnutron> Zealot12: intrepid, probably so, just installed ibex today on one box.
[09:27] <Photoguy> Battlefield 2
[09:27] <Severian> ddoom,  I would do      sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[09:28] <amdpox> Severian, that's hardly a permenant solution

[09:30] <Photoguy> Ok, but I'm on Windows now..
[09:30] <mrglinux> I have big problem .. my ubunu can not get any package from repository
[09:30] <gnutron> Zealot12: what version?
[09:30] <Photoguy> Using Rosetta srtone.
[09:30] <gnutron> Zealot12: what version ubuntu
[09:30] <amdpox> Photoguy, you'll have more luck with interactive support if you can interact ;)
[09:30] <danaka> what's the linux equivalent of ipconfig?
[09:30] <amdpox> danaka, ifconfig
[09:30] <danaka> thanks
[09:30] <Photoguy> Right.
[09:31] <mrglinux> I check repository for example http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com but when I apt-get install . can not find package but when I manual get with wget I can ...
[09:31] <Zealot12> gnutron: oh I am on Intrepid I believe (its 8.10)
[09:31] <ActionParsnip> danaka: you can also display single interfaces with ifconfig eth0 for example
[09:31] <amdpox> mrglinux, have you apt-get updated recently?
[09:31] <gnutron> Zealot12: lsb_release -a in a term. intrepid did away with xserver.xorg
[09:31] <mrglinux> amdpox yes I had
[09:31] <ddoom> btw, I did update-rc.d -f gdm remove which worked
[09:31] <Severian> When I am changing services, I normall just adjust the symlinks in /etc/rc2.d, but I don't usually suggest others try it that way.
[09:32] <Circuitsoft> Anyone know anything about HD Audio?
[09:32] <gnutron> ddoom: cool. i just learned something, thx
[09:32] <mrglinux> but it hase a problem im sure.. I could not install anything
[09:32] <mrglinux> I have to get with wget
[09:33] <Hew> How do I identify which process is sending packets regularly on a particular port?
[09:34] <Zealot12> gnutron: I says "No LSB modules are available" then it lists the Ubuntu distributor ID and release info
[09:34] <gnutron> Hew: install wireshark
[09:34] <gnutron> Zealot12: yeah, thats what it does.
[09:34] <Hew> gnutron: Done, I can see packets being sent from a certain port. How do I find which process is doing it?
[09:35] <nickla1> hello, if I wanna use a usb memory as boot device instead of a cd, and burn the iso to the usb memory instead, what file format should the usb memory be, and can I just unpack the iso and copy the files to the usb memory or do I have to use some program?

[09:44] <ActionParsnip> ktorrent + web interface :)
[09:44] <brandan> Is it possible to format a disk without connecting it to the computer or anything because my hard disk is stuck in a verry bad sector and won't boot
[09:44] <dnyy> Hmm, so that didn't work out.  I followed the instructions, it said the driver was installed successfully, restarted, and was told no display device was found.
[09:44] <ActionParsnip> danaka: ktorrent allows encryption, if you dont have kde libs already installed they will be needed too
[09:44] <danaka> alright thanks
[09:45] <ActionParsnip> brandan: no, it needs connecting to a system for power and controling to be formatted
[09:45] <magnetron> brandan <unconvertable> start from a CD, format it using the tools on the CD
[09:45] <rohdef> does anyone know of a xxx-commander (like gnome-commander) that asks automatically for sudo password when trying to do something restricted (like editing a file in /etc)?
[09:45] <ActionParsnip> brandan: ive heard of people waving magnets over them but i dont personally advise it
[09:45] <youshaoyun> who know qingshuang ,what is it?
[09:45] <brandan> ActionParsnip lol
[09:46] <youshaoyun> who know qingshuang ,what is it?
[09:46] <SlimeyPete> ActionParsnip: one would have to open the casing for that anyway unless one has access to an enormous electromagnet ;)
[09:46] <ActionParsnip> brandan: if you get the ultimate boot cd, you can run the diagnostic tool from the drives manufacturer to test it
[09:46] <brandan> ActionParsnip Its under warn by Western Digital I guess i can just call them
[09:46] <ActionParsnip> brandan: sounds like the best route
[09:46] <brandan> ActionParsnip BIOS won't boot with it linux and Windows Crash
[09:46] <ActionParsnip> SlimeyPete: i could make one pretty quick ;)
[09:47] <ActionParsnip> brandan: sounds like the IDE is shot on the drive
[09:47] <brandan> Could this happend when windows was writing on it and then it was unpluged (USB extrenal drive)
[09:48] <brandan> I took out the drive itself and connected it to SATA
[09:48] <ActionParsnip> brandan: you could have caused a power spike, but dont mention that ;)
[09:48] <brandan> :)
[09:49] <rohdef> anyone know of a ***-commander (like midnight-commander) that can easily access windows shares?
[09:49] <ActionParsnip> brandan: is the controller pin for master / slave in the right place?

[09:51] <Firetramp> Hi, just installed Ubuntu 8.10, and the interface is rather.. slow. I've heard that upgrading to the Nvidia Beta drivers solves this issue. Is there anyway to get Ubuntu to do this automatically, or will I have to install it manually?
[09:51] <zetheroo> <unconvertable> ActionParsnip: sorry I did not mean install it, since it is already installed ... but there was a command to "activate" it somehow ...

[10:01] <ActionParsnip1> lianimator: pull down mic volume from 100%
[10:01] <bushwakko> what's wrong?
[10:01] <lianimator> ActionParsnip1: I'm using my laptop as an amplifier for my guitar
[10:02] <kamenoko> hello, i cannot reveive dcc transfers in xchat-gnome, would someone be willing to help me?
[10:02] <lianimator> ActionParsnip1: pulling down would reduce the volume as well
[10:02] <Tch23> lianimator: a laptop is not an amplifier you know
[10:02] <ActionParsnip1> lianimator: yeah but you crank up the lower volume and you get better quality
[10:02] <daftykins> kamenoko, that's probably more down to your router / port forwarding config than Xchat / Linux
[10:02] <kamenoko> okie dokie
[10:02] <ActionParsnip1> lianimator: its lke having your amp cranked up and your cab low, its sounds terrible
[10:02] <lianimator> ActionParsnip1: mic down, volume up huh?
[10:03] <ActionParsnip1> lianimator: yeah
[10:03] <ActionParsnip1> lianimator: please tell me you keep your amp at low levels
[10:03] <kamenoko> should the ports involved be mapped using udp or tcp?
[10:03] <lianimator> ActionParsnip1: any idea of what to do with mic boost?
[10:03] <SmokeyD> hey people. Is there a tool that allows me to directly edit gpg encrypted text files, which first decrypts the file, let's me edit it, and then encrypts it again?
[10:03] <daftykins> kamenoko, TCP - do you have a router yeah?

[10:05] <Tch23> lianimator: wich mic which card?
[10:05] <SmokeyD> aaaa``: please provide some more information
[10:06] <SmokeyD> when do you get that error?
[10:06] <SmokeyD> what exactly are you doing?
[10:06] <aaaa``> Im trying to install Ubuntu from Ubuntu CD.. It copies the data and reboots ... then comes the Input/Output Errno5.
[10:06] <lianimator> Tch23: Intel 82801G (ICH7 Family) HD audio controller (rev 02)
[10:06] <daftykins> aaaa``,  so it fully installs but after restarting to exit the LiveCD you get that?
[10:07] <aaaa``> yes
[10:07] <daftykins> is it definitely booting from the HDD at that point?
[10:07] <daftykins> and you've taken the disc out?
[10:07] <aaaa``> i tried the downloaded Iso.. + the CD i took by my friend.
[10:07] <aaaa``> yes
[10:07] <ActionParsnip1> aaaa``: did you md5 check the image you downloaded as well as checking the cd for defects at first boot?
[10:07] <Tch23> lianimator: gish... do you really expect to have good quality with that?
[10:07] <daftykins> run the disc self checker off the boot menu

[10:08] <youshaoyun> let's fuck  qinshuang  ,please say that follow me

[10:08] <aaaa``> y friend installed from the same disc.
[10:08] <Tch23> lianimator: Aidacity can reduce noise by playing with frecquencies but you'll never have a good sound
[10:08] <LoveGuru> afancy: i think its saying there library 'pam' missing
[10:08] <Flannel> youshaoyun: Please keep it on topic and family friendly
[10:08] <gregseth> afancy: lemme guess... libpam ?
[10:08] <afancy> LoveGuru: yes,i see, but i dont know which library
[10:09] <afancy> gregseth: there is many libspam, but in dont know which one
[10:09] <Tch23> lianimator: download audacity, put an hipass filter on your sound and delete high frequencies (perhaps some mid freqs) until your sound is clean enough
[10:09] <aaaa``> i tried to find the solution at forums.. no success :(
[10:09] <youshaoyun> OK
[10:09] <lianimator> Tch23: and audacity can do this on-the-fly?
[10:09] <Tch23> lianimator: maybe you'll even find an hiss filter built in
[10:10] <daftykins> or maybe he'll buy something sensible instead of trying to use a laptop for audio related stuffs :P
[10:10] <Tch23> lianimator: nop audacity have to calculate stuff

[10:10] <Tch23> lianimator: well...a little bit more complicated
[10:11] <kern> how come when i set up a wired connection in network manager when i add the netmask as  255.255.255.0 it will hcange it to 24 ??
[10:11] <aaaa``> Im trying again.. if again failed.. Ill not try again..
[10:11] <daftykins> aaaa``, i said use the disc checker
[10:11] <daftykins> off the boot menu
[10:11] <kamenoko> kekeke, the problem was with auto-accepted dcc's, it's all better now, thanks for the help :D
[10:11] <lianimator> Tch23: ever heard of guitarFX3?
[10:11] <daftykins> kamenoko,  :) as in they were turned off?
[10:11] <Tch23> lianimator: download jack, download some LADSPA from synaptic,
[10:11] <kamenoko> nah, it was turned on
[10:11] <ActionParsnip1> daftykins: you can get reasonable SoundBalster PCMCIA card which will do ok audio sampling but yeah for audio stuffs I'd probably jump a mac
[10:11] <daftykins> ah ok, cool
[10:11] <kamenoko> once i had to confirm a send, it worked great
[10:12] <daftykins> onboard sound from a laptop is always going to be highly susceptible to EMI
[10:12] <ActionParsnip1> daftykins: dont you just love when peolple dont check the disk at any point then moan the install isnt right
[10:12] <SmokeyD> aaaa``: how did you install? Do you have windows as well? Did you erase the whole disk or use existing partitions?
[10:12] <Tch23> lianimator:then jackrack or some realtime effect soft... then hook up stuff like that in jack : Mic In->Jack Rack ->output
[10:12] <kamenoko> and cosmic rays

[10:14] <Flannel> lianimator, Tch23: the "go away and find it yourself" attitude isn't welcome here.  If you're going to help, be helpful.
[10:14] <ActionParsnip1> afancy: then reinstall it
[10:15] <Polysics> i feel stupid for asking for this but... how do i launch a command in a way that makes it continue even if i log out?
[10:15] <ActionParsnip1> !screen
[10:15] <ubottu> screen is a terminal multiplexer. See http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen
[10:15] <Polysics> i have to do a lenghty geocoding and wanted to be able to turn off the client machine
[10:15] <Tch23> Flannel: I knom man... I should have said "it's out of my reach"...
[10:15] <ActionParsnip1> Polysics: theres something called screen that does it or something ( i believe )
[10:15] <Tch23> lianimator: is it clearer
[10:16] <chimp> A script im trying to run in init.d needs full network access before it can run, is there a way I can implement this?
[10:16] <Tch23> lianimator: or d'you need some more explainations?
[10:16] <ikonia> chimp thats already done
[10:16] <cuonglb> hi all
[10:16] <chimp> At the minute it seems to run too early, and doesnt connect
[10:16] <Photoguy> I'm trying to run Rosetta stone, but when I try to run (under Wine) it says "please insert correct cd-rom"
[10:16] <ikonia> chimp: innit sciprts are run as root
[10:16] <Flannel> Tch23: Sounds good.  Thanks.
[10:16] <Photoguy> I have it in a physical drive.
[10:16] <daftykins> Photoguy, wine won't map the CD to the Linux system CD mount point automatically
[10:16] <lianimator> Tch23: thanks, I'm installing jack-rack
[10:16] <Photoguy> Ok..
[10:16] <chimp> ikonia: I realise that, its simply when the script is run from bootup it doesnt find the server its supposed to connect to
[10:16] <chimp> but does once its booted
[10:17] <ikonia> chimp that doesn't mean it needs root
[10:17] <chimp> ahh sorry, badly worded
[10:17] <ActionParsnip1> Polysics: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-776385.html
[10:17] <Polysics> ActionParsnip1, screen is GREAT, thanks :-)
[10:17] <chimp> What i mean is i need the computer to have fully connected to the network, before the script is run
[10:17] <ActionParsnip1> Polysics: np man
[10:17] <Polysics> it's useful for a variety of things
[10:17] <Tch23> Flannel: sociological statement : It's weird cause forums push people to "RTFM" and find by themself... While IRC don't.... It may be because forums have limited space while IRC don't... I think I got a forum behavior in the wrong place
[10:18] <ikonia> chimp then order it after the networking setup
[10:18] <Photoguy> So how do I assign it?
[10:18] <chimp> ikonia: How do I do that?
[10:18] <ActionParsnip1> chimp: you could have it test the connectivitys at the strat of the script. Once all are ok, run the next bits
[10:18] <chimp> How do i make it run last
[10:18] <daftykins> Photoguy, not sure how WINE maps a CD drive
[10:18] <ikonia> chimp look at the order of the scripts in /etc/rc2.d
[10:18] <Photoguy> Oh.
[10:18] <cuonglb> Kernel panic, how can i recovery ?
[10:18] <daftykins> is there anything that looks like "drive D" in ~/.wine/ ?

[10:18] <daftykins> the place where it puts the "fake" hard disk
[10:19] <cuonglb> repeat power off and back on = n lolz :D
[10:19] <daftykins> back in a bit, got a job to do

[10:19] <ha6i> can some one help me to troubleshoot audia device? i am using ubuntu 8.10....
[10:19] <ActionParsnip1> Photoguy: is there any option to point the 'cd drive' to a folder on the system
[10:20] <Robbie_Crash> is there any reason for me to backup ~/.gvfs?
[10:20] <Photoguy> Ok, I'll look into it.
[10:20] <ActionParsnip1> Photoguy: like rosettastone.exe -source="C:\somefolder\"
[10:20] <ActionParsnip1> Photoguy: run the exe with /? on the end
[10:20] <ActionParsnip1> Photoguy: or maybe theres a reg hack to get round
[10:20] <Photoguy> hmm.
[10:20] <DaveKong> what is a good dictionary application similar to the xfce dictionary without all the dependencies?

[10:22] <sdf> :P
[10:22] <ActionParsnip1> !sound | ha6i
[10:22] <ubottu> ha6i: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer).

[10:34] <shrini> ActionParsnip1: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb
[10:34] <nickla1> bullgard4: ok
[10:34] <ActionParsnip1> shrini: you could add it to /etc/fstab
[10:34] <shrini> ActionParsnip1: ? how?
[10:35] <ActionParsnip1> !fstab | shrini
[10:35] <ubottu> shrini: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[10:35] <moDumass> aaaargghhh every time i do a big system update - one that requires a reeboot, my graphics get totally schwaked
[10:35] <moDumass> like 640x480
[10:35] <shrini> ActionParsnip1: /etc/fstab will mount on boot time only, I think
[10:36] <shrini> ActionParsnip: I want automount
[10:36] <ActionParsnip1> shrini: it will try, if the usb isnt there it will be ignored
[10:36] <shrini> ActionParsnip1: will it mount it, when it finds one?
[10:36] <ActionParsnip1> shrini: if you have it in there it should automount. I dont use automount myself. I prefer to manage my system
[10:36] <firetrap> moDumass, maybe because you are upgrading your kernel and the required graphics driver isn't available for that kernel version?
[10:36] <ActionParsnip1> shrini: yeah definately
[10:36] <FluxD> Hi, what happened to the www-data user on intrepid?
[10:36] <Ian_Corne> shrini: mount -a makes everything mount that's not mounted in the fdisk file
[10:36] <Ian_Corne> fstab*
[10:37] <ActionParsnip1> Ian_Corne: thatd need sudo
[10:37] <moDumass> firetrap, i dloaded the nvidia driver, and installed it so its not that
[10:37] <ultratek> how do i get emerald to start usin it
[10:37] <EeVeeTzA> Help: I tried to instal "fingerprint" splash theme, and I lose the splash... Now i can only see textual look. I'm newbie, so sorry if the explanation was not good

[10:37] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: emerald --replace & 2>/dev/null
[10:37] <firetrap> moDumass, and you downloaded the correct one for your new kernel version?
[10:38] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: if you head into emerald settings manager you can apply the theme
[10:38] <FluxD> Hi, what happened to the www-data user on intrepid?
[10:38] <DIFH-iceroot> DaveKong: i am using it for german <-> english, just have to use the correct dictionary-file
[10:38] <moDumass> firetrap, i have 3d desktop. just only 640x480
[10:38] <DIFH-iceroot> DaveKong: i think i am using the ispell file
[10:38] <firetrap> moDumass, strange, lool
[10:38] <shrini> ActionParsnip1: fine. Thanks
[10:38] <shrini> Thanks for all
[10:38] <shrini> will try and tell
[10:39] <ActionParsnip1> shrini: if you are gonna mes with fstab

[10:39] <shrini> ActionParsnip1: fine
[10:39] <firetrap> moDumass, can't you adjust the resolution?
[10:39] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: you can alt + drag, im guessing you have an nvidia card?
[10:40] <ultratek> ati
[10:40] <ultratek> ohh
[10:40] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: ok run: compiz --replace & 2>/dev/null
[10:40] <moDumass> firetrap, 640x480 lower are the only options
[10:40] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: you are missing your window decorators
[10:40] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: find a fix for that and you can jump to emerald
[10:40] <moDumass> firetrap, its like its not detecting the monitor type
[10:40] <firetrap> moDumass, try editing your xorg.conf, you can add extra resolutions in there
[10:41] <ultratek> how do i close windows now
[10:41] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: alt+ f4
[10:41] <ultratek> yea
[10:41] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: id switch back to whatever you were on before (compiz or metacity) and fix your window decorator issue
[10:42] <ultratek> how do i fix it
[10:42] <Ned_Flanders7> kewl quake4 is running fine

[10:44] <ultratek> kool
[10:44] <Robbie_Crash> How can I create a custom resolution with nvidia drivers, when adding said res to my xorg.conf does not work? I'm a victim of overscanning.
[10:44] <ultratek> i will get lost ...

[10:46] <steveccc> hi all - i have intrepid installed but would like to have open office 3 - i have seen on the web insructions to add another repo and then it is possible to upgrade to it - will this cause any issues later when ubuntu releases the update - woudl i be better to wait?
[10:46] <FluxD> !lighttpd
[10:46] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lighttpd
[10:46] <ultratek> how do i do that?
[10:46] <FluxD> !apache
[10:46] <ubottu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[10:46] <ultratek> just type that cmd
[10:46] <ultratek> ?
[10:46] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:46] <nickla1> !gkfd
[10:46] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gkfd
[10:46] <allsystemsarego> !info lighttpd | FluxD

[10:46] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: you could try adding: Option         "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True" to your screen section
[10:47] <Robbie_Crash> nickla1 there's nothing in there that would help with my problem. My drivers are installed properly, the problem is that transmitting to my 1080p at 1080 res cuts off 20 pixels top and bottom and 42 left and right.
[10:47] <FluxD> allsystemsarego, what happened to www-data user ?
[10:47] <gunnarahlberg>  my laptop panics from time to time. I've tried sysrq+r but that doesn't work from X but from terminal. If I'm lucky, I Ctrl-f2 and then sysrq works. not from X. And I can't find the reason for the panics! Help
[10:47] <allsystemsarego> FluxD, some context please?
[10:48] <nickla1> Robbie_Crash: I don't know what do about this, it's a known bug I think
[10:48] <nickla1> right, it's a known bug?
[10:48] <FluxD> allsystemsarego, I thought there was a www-data user and group?
[10:48] <Dam0> hi

[10:48] <FluxD> allsystemsarego, upon typing users and groups I see nothing in list
[10:49] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: yep
[10:49] <allsystemsarego> FluxD, yes, grep www /etc/group
[10:49] <Robbie_Crash> nickla1 I'm not sure that it's a known bug, it's a known annoyance and known limitation
[10:49] <sinan> is there a way to find the temperature of my CPU from terminal?
[10:49] <ultratek> all done

[10:49] <Dam0> hey how do i get rid od the ` next to my ident?
[10:50] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: ok, save, close gedit and reboot. If its no good, boot to failsafe and edit out the lines with sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:50] <ActionParsnip1> ultratek: i'd write that down ;)
[10:50] <allsystemsarego> FluxD, yes add your user to the www-data group
[10:50] <FluxD> allsystemsarego, then I can see all php pages?
[10:51] <Dam0>  how do i get rid of the ` next to my ident?
[10:51] <allsystemsarego> FluxD, you also need to learn about Linux permissions
[10:51] <ultratek> ty
[10:51] <ActionParsnip1> Dam0: means you are connected to freenode somewhere else
[10:51] <FluxD> allsystemsarego, and how can I do that?
[10:51] <ActionParsnip1> Dam0: so you get that to differentiate
[10:52] <Dam0> ActionParsnip1>: yeah im on dalnet...how do i get rif of it?
[10:52] <Dam0> rif=rid
[10:52] <ActionParsnip1> Dam0: i dunno how to solve it. Though, i think theres a self boot command as you know the password for the account
[10:52] <Dam0> ok

[11:06] <Debolaz[Pidgin]> I'm trying to add a static IP address to eth0, in addition to the dynamic address I already have. I've edited dhclient.conf and added an "alias" entry like it says in the documentation, but the alias isn't added by dhclient when I boot. However, if I restart dhclient with the exact same parameters as ubuntu starts it with, the static IP address entry is added correctly. How do I get the IP address to be added on boot?

[11:33] <Panarchy> Please tell me how to install without a GUI
[11:33] <ompaul> BoogieBoo, pptp is not secure so you won't find anyone really interested in it, I would suggest you use openvpn in its place
[11:33] <cmv583> Panarchy:  can u help me?
[11:33] <Robbie_Crash> Panarchy you could install the server version
[11:33] <ompaul> !pptp | BoogieBoo
[11:33] <ubottu> BoogieBoo: pptp is not good according to Bruce Schneier http://schneier.com/pptp.html  here the words insecurity are useful
[11:33] <BoogieBoo> Robbie_Crash, I am still using hardy, I was used to establish successfully VPN connection to PPTP server in our company network using networ-manager, however since the last Ubuntu Updateds it just stoped to work getting only CONNECTION FAILED
[11:34] <BoogieBoo> ompaul, did you read what I wrote before?? I dont care if PPTP is secure or not, it is my company VPN server and I don't decide wether should be OPeVPN or somehting else, I just need to connect to get files to WORK
