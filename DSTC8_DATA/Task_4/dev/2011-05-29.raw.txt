[15:30] <ikonia> that is official
[15:30] <fooman2011> When the user stop the PC using the "halt" command, the wake on lan is OK (I mean i can turn on the PC from a webpage). But when a script called by cron turn off the PC (using "halt" too) the wake on lan is NOK.

[15:31] <killerklown> thx both of you guys, you rock !
[15:31] <pozic> Why don't Unity and Unity2d share the same menu entries?
[15:31] <BorgTK2001> pozic, I think they will by the time 12.04LTS comes around
[15:31] <ikonia> fooman2011: I'm surprised, I'd expect "halt" to not have WOL enabled
[15:31] <fooman2011> I have tried to add "ethtool -s eth0 wol g" in /etc/rc.local and /etc/network/interface without any success
[15:31] <BorgTK2001> but this time around, 10.04 is a test bed for unity-2d
[15:32] <pozic> BorgTK2001: I detect sarcasm.
=== uri is now known as uri247
[15:32] <BorgTK2001> 10.04 should be 11.04
[15:32] <jm__> any xubunter here'
[15:32] <Shaba1> what is and xubunter?
[15:32] <fooman2011> ikonia: it's seems to be more secure to unactive WOL at shutdown...
[15:32] <ikonia> jm__: #xubuntu and just ask the question
[15:32] <Centallith> A user that uses Xubuntu.
[15:32] <jm__> than
[15:33] <llutz> fooman2011: place a short script containing  "/sbin/ethtool -s ethX wol g" in /etc/network/if-down.d/
[15:33] <ikonia> fooman2011: I'm just surprised WOL responds at all after a halt
[15:33] <jack_bt5> hi guys - just quickly i am trying to connect to #backtack-linux but it says i am banned
[15:33] <BorgTK2001> pozic: deadly serious. I'm an LTS user exclusivly, and very disappointed Unity is not available for me till 12.04
[15:33] <Centallith> Okay, so is there anyone who knows how to restore the "Applications" launcher to the Unity dock? I seem to have removed it somehow.
[15:33] <ikonia> jack_bt5: ask for help in #freenode
[15:33] <fooman2011> llutz: ok thank (what is this directoy ?
[15:33] <fooman2011> )
[15:33] <jack_bt5> thank you
[15:34] <pozic> BorgTK2001: well, I can certainly understand why they did that.

[15:35] <zxiest> Hello :-)
[15:35] <BorgTK2001> pozic: Unity is definitely not finished yet :)
[15:35] <zxiest> If I stop a service, would it restart when the server reboots?
[15:35] <ikonia> zxiest: depends if the service is set to auto start
[15:35] <pozic> BorgTK2001: I like the double tab to get to the starter menu.
[15:36] <zxiest> ikonia how can I check whether a service is set to auto start?
[15:36] <pozic> Heh, it appears to be a single tap in 2d.
[15:36] <BorgTK2001> pozic: :)
[15:36] <pozic> Consistency went -> that way.

[15:44] <pozic> Byobu says that F9 should bring up the menu, but it doesn't. The other F keybindings do work.
[15:44] <pozic> How can I get F9 to do something useful?
[15:44] <BorgTK2001> Hi GregAce - can we help?
[15:44] <GregAce> hey guys I have a problem with my keyboard
[15:44] <BorgTK2001> OKies, GregAce
[15:44] <GregAce> @BorgTK2001, yep
[15:45] <GregAce> my keyboard is doing something funny
[15:45] <GregAce> working well here
[15:45] <GregAce> but in the terminal is doing funny stuff
[15:46] <escott> pozic, double check that f9 isn't bound to something else in the window manager with ccsm (compiz) or gconftool (metacity)
[15:46] <GregAce> but only when I'm editing someting in VI or installing stuff with cpan
[15:46] <GregAce> you guys have any idea what it could be ?
[15:46] <ikonia> GregAce: why don't you just tell us the problem instead of explaining nothing
[15:46] <ikonia> GregAce: "something funny" is pointless information
[15:47] <GregAce> ok fair enough
[15:47] <bullgard4> ikonia: The DEB program package openoffice.org-base has even the word "ubuntu" in its installed version number: 1.3.3.0-7ubuntu4.2. And you are telling me that this does not belong to Ubuntu.
[15:47] <BorgTK2001> GregAce: A US keyboard or someother keyboard layout?
[15:47] <sahip> hello, I am going to buy a new desktop computer, how can I make sure that its drivers are linux-compatible?
[15:47] <ikonia> bullgard4: I'm telling you learning how to use openoffice would be better served in #openoffice.org
[15:47] <GregAce> when i write it's nothe writting the right stroke
[15:47] <aeon-ltd> sahip: theres no quick way except look up the specs and then come back here or google to check
[15:48] <ikonia> GregAce: this may sound insulting (apologies if it does) but do you know how to use vi, eg insert mode
[15:48] <BorgTK2001> For example, GregAce ?
[15:48] <VCoolio> sahip: google the video
[15:48] <GregAce> and the combination ctrl+arrow is making
[15:48] <GregAce> [[A
[15:48] <VCoolio> sahip: video card, that's where the problem may be, the rest should work
[15:48] <GregAce> BorgTK2001, yep us layout
[15:49] <sahip> I know the specs... what page can I use to confirm that the graphics card is compatible?,
[15:49] <BorgTK2001> GregAce: who's been giving you instructions to use vi?
[15:49] <ikonia> !hcl | sahip
[15:49] <ubottu> sahip: For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport - To help debugging and improving hardware detection, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingHardwareDetection
[15:49] <GregAce> it does that has well in cpan
[15:49] <ikonia> GregAce: "in cpan" ?
[15:49] <BorgTK2001> as gedit will suffice ;)
[15:50] <GregAce> cpan is the perl module installer
[15:50] <sahip> ikonia:  is it the same case for other distributions?
[15:50] <ikonia> GregAce: yes, but "in cpan"
[15:50] <GregAce> agreed but that's not the point here
[15:50] <vibhav> sahip, http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/36813
[15:50] <ikonia> sahip: other distributions have different supported/unsupported hardware, this is just for ubuntu
[15:50] <sahip> v
[15:50] <sahip> vibhab, looking at that
[15:51] <ikonia> vibhav: look at the date on that, 2004 !
[15:51] <BorgTK2001> GregAce: vi uses shoddy [In My Opinion] key inputs
[15:51] <ikonia> vibhav: do you really think that is a valid supported list for 2011 ?
[15:51] <fooman2011> When the user stop the PC using the "halt" command, the wake on lan is OK (I mean i can turn on the PC from a webpage). But when a script called by cron turn off the PC (using "halt" too) the wake on lan is NOK. All manipulations that i have made desicribed here => http://pastebin.com/FxfRcAFf   Thanks for your help...
[15:51] <vibhav> ikonia,  Lemmee see
[15:51] <jack_bt5> thanks a lot
[15:51] <GregAce> for example I press the upward arrow in vi and it's printin "A"
[15:51] <ikonia> vibhav: you've not even read it and your recommending it ?
[15:51] <ikonia> GregAce: that's termcap, up arrow is not a valid vi input
[15:52] <BorgTK2001> Up-arrow in vi does NOT do what we would normally expect
[15:52] <vibhav> sahip, http://www.directron.com/linuxguide.html
[15:52] <ikonia> vibhav: stop now
[15:52] <vibhav> ikonia,  This is a good guide
[15:52] <BorgTK2001> vi is for people like Richard Stallman
[15:52] <ikonia> vibhav: stop recommending random links to people that you have not read
[15:52] <ikonia> bullgard4: no, it's not
[15:52] <BorgTK2001> Use gedit instead
[15:52] <GregAce> when I press the key "P" it's printing "C"
[15:52] <ikonia> bullgard4: sorry, not you
[15:52] <vibhav> ikonia,  I am reading it right now
[15:52] <ikonia> BorgTK2001: no it's not, people can use what editor they want
[15:53] <GregAce> BorgTK2001,  shoddy ?
[15:53] <ikonia> vibhav: read it BEFORE recommending it
[15:53] <ikonia> sahip: I suggest you ignore vibhav's links
[15:53] <BorgTK2001> ikonia: They certainly can :)
[15:53] <BorgTK2001> GregAce: shoddy do to the very problem you are having
[15:53] <BorgTK2001> do = due
[15:53] <waveshaper> amazing. I have to google on how to disable my own machines sleep mode. it just amazes me that certain OS companies doesnt get HCI at all
[15:54] <yeastwars> ever since I updated from i to m, flash has been eating 80-90% cpu (mostly video, but also happens with simpler programs). Halp?
[15:54] <BorgTK2001> GregAce - you just have to put up with that in vi, nothing can be done about that
[15:54] <JoshuaL> waveshaper, if you have any better idea on how to implement it, share it at http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/ :)
[15:54] <GregAce> BorgTK2001, I usderstand what you're saying but I want to fix that keyboard problem
[15:54] <waveshaper> oh sry. this was a win7 rant :/
[15:55] <vibhav> http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialHardware.html ikonia
[15:55] <waveshaper> not ubuntu at all
[15:55] <BorgTK2001> GregAce: you cannot in vi
[15:55] <ikonia> GregAce: it's not a keyboard problem
[15:55] <GregAce> it's not normal that when I press "P" it writtes C
[15:55] <BorgTK2001> Those keyboard errors are hardcoded into vi, GregAce, not your keyboard
[15:55] <fooman2011> is it normal to have to modifiy the halt script ??
[15:55] <sahip> ikonia: why should I ignore his links??
[15:55] <GregAce> mmm kay
[15:55] <ikonia> sahip: because they are old and not relevant
[15:55] <BorgTK2001> You have to scream and shout at Richard Stallman if you want the vi keys to change
[15:56] <sahip> ikonia: okay, thanks
[15:56] <yeastwars> BorgTK2001: er, he's an emacs dev
[15:56] <GregAce> i've google shoddy can't find anything
[15:56] <ikonia> BorgTK2001: STOP referencing richard stallman,
[15:56] <ikonia> GregAce: the problem is your termcap sends more strict input to applications such as "vim"
[15:56] <GregAce> haha sorry I've strated that fight guys
[15:56] <yeastwars> GregAce: if you haven't guessed yet, this channel is useless. Try #vim?
[15:56] <BorgTK2001> I don't like RMS, but I do like Torvalds
[15:56] <ikonia> GregAce: other distros use different termcaps to example so the arrows sill send, h,j,k,l to vi to emmulate it
[15:57] <GregAce> ok,
[15:57] <detrix42> how do I install an older version of a program. Devede in particular is not working with current version.
[15:57] <ikonia> BorgTK2001: I'm not interested in who you like, stop referencing stallman in a derogatory way

[15:58] <GregAce> anyway thanks guys
[15:58] <BorgTK2001> ikonia: Done and done :)
[15:58] <arand> GregAce: You may want to use vim insteadd of vi.
[15:58] <GregAce> i'll try that but as I stated is does this as well in cpan
[15:58] <GregAce> so I though it was relatred to my keyboard config
[15:59] <jongbergs> I would like to find some useful resources preferable presentation that will serve as instructional materials regarding Intro to Linux/Ubuntu designed for beginners.
[15:59] <arand> GregAce: It is simply the case that vi and possibly cpan then, was never intendded to be navigated via the arrow keys.

[16:02] <ejv> (there is very little that's not covered)
[16:03] <GregAce> used vim and it works fine
[16:03] <mun__> does anyone know why after a bit of upgrading, clicking on the link to a downloaded file in firefox, chrome, opens up the download directory rather than the file itself?
[16:03] <GregAce> dunno what's wrong with vi
[16:04] <Corey> ejv: Heh, there are a few things I wasn't aware of in there.  What a great doc. :-)
[16:04] <jongbergs> ejv let me check..many thanks for that..

[16:11] <BorgTK2001> or just coppied .deb files to a CD

[16:14] <reliableNerd> Thank goodness though when I had my baby I quit WoW.  But while I did play, I had no problems.
[16:15] <`alz1> that sound like emulation whci usually is a bit of a drag
[16:15] <BorgTK2001> as some of reliableNerd 's games work, mine [Homeworld 2] do not :(
[16:15] <reliableNerd> `alz1, WINE stands for Wine is not an Emulator
[16:15] <BluesKaj> `alz1, , I've dual booted windows and linux off and on for 7yrs and now kubuntu is my only OS ...no need for windows at all
[16:15] <johnnee> well it was 10.10, and i got some automatic update and wouldn't boot since, but i still could see the menu, but only windows could load, so i got a live cd of 11.04 and tried to edit/fix grub, but now i only get grub rescue> prompt..
[16:15] <BorgTK2001> WINE trys to reverse engineer/backwards compateable direct calls to hardware
[16:16] <BorgTK2001> but since Microsoft doesn't release the code to windows, WINE has to guess the calls
[16:16] <ejv> johnnee: im not sure grub has changed at all (installation wise) from 1.0 to 2.0, but just 'sudo grub' then 'root (hd0,0)' then 'setup (hd0)' then 'exit' and reboot. the boot menu should in theory resurface...
[16:16] <BorgTK2001> Guess's them well, but not 100%

[16:19] <Skunkwaffle> Could someone please get me pointed in the right direction? I just did an update on Lucid, and it seems to have removed my network manager. Now I can't get online with my other computer at all. Anyone know how to fix this?
[16:19] <johnnee> ejv, edbian: that's the commands i tried when i read the forums and was advised to use, but that made me lose the menu altogether and now even windows won't load.. if you have time can you teamviewer into my pc and fix this issue please?

[16:20] <edbian> johnnee: I won't teamview in but I will teach you how to fix it.  It's only one command.  How's that sound??
[16:20] <johnnee> edbian: yes is the answer to your question, but ialso have a 10.10 live cd also
[16:20] <edbian> johnnee: Grab and boot the 10.10 live CD.  I am more confident about the grub-install command that is on that live CD.

[16:22] <fooman2011> ok I ask one more time my question because i dont find a solution ... :(
[16:22] <fooman2011> When the user stop the PC using the "halt" command, the wake on lan is OK (I mean i can turn on the PC from a webpage). But when a script called by cron turn off the PC (using "halt" too) the wake on lan is NOK. All manipulations that i have made desicribed here => http://pastebin.com/FxfRcAFf   Thanks for your help...
[16:22] <johnnee> edbian: oh man it took me long enough to get to this point where i can join this chat channel, not sure if i can get back on so you can continue helping me..
[16:23] <edbian> johnnee: Sure, no big deal.  You're on a 11.04 live CD then right now?

[16:24] <skrip> yes with wired network
[16:24] <edbian> skrip: sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer
[16:24] <edbian> skrip: That installs the firmware for the card
[16:24] <`alz1> is there any difference betw 32 and 64 bit ubuntu versions in stability /performance etc  (my machine is 64 bit) ?
[16:24] <johnnee> edbian: YES, im on live cd 11.04... if i could just get my windows back, im open to back up some important files and reinstall both... i have an external drive i can connect via usb also.
[16:24] <edbian> skrip: sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter   (this installs a program that extracts and uses the firmware on each boot)
[16:25] <Skunkwaffle> Hello to everyone I have a problem with the wireless & wired, anyone who can help me?
[16:25] <ikonia> Skunkwaffle: ask the question
[16:25] <skrip> done that already
[16:25] <edbian> johnnee: first you need to mount the ubuntu partition.  sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt   You can figure out what number X should be by looking at the output of sudo fdisk -l
[16:25] <Skunkwaffle> Just did a fresh instal of Lucid and after the initial update, I seem to have lost all ability to connect to the internet. Has anyone heard of anything like this before?
[16:25] <edbian> skrip: sudo modprobe b43  and it should spring to life
[16:26] <ikonia> Skunkwaffle: could you explain the problem a bit more than "doesn't work"

[16:26] <sahip> his ati 4850, does anyone use this graphics card?  is it linux compatible?
[16:26] <anddam> hello
[16:26] <johnnee> i did that edbian
[16:26] <peter__> i've a problem during install madwifi

[16:26] <skrip> op that last command work thanks ... what exact did it does?
[16:26] <peter__> anyone can help me?
[16:26] <jaggy> sahip: I'm currently on 4650
[16:26] <fooman2011> ikonia: do you have any idea why the halt command called from a user doesn't have the same result than the halt command call from the cron ?
[16:26] <edbian> johnnee: awesome.  So if you go into /mnt you see the files for your Ubuntu system right?  It should NOT be an empty folder
[16:27] <Skunkwaffle> I just did an update on Lucid, and it seems to have removed my network manager.
[16:27] <ikonia> fooman2011: no, I'm surprised as to what it works
[16:27] <anddam> can I add an icon in Launcher for all Games?
[16:27] <edbian> skrip: It inserts the module into the kernel.  It's like turning the driver on.  What guide did you follow that is missing that command?
[16:27] <ikonia> Skunkwaffle: so you don't have the network manager applet any more ?
[16:27] <sahip> ikonia: I am afraid you have to link that again... I reconnected
[16:27] <xangua> peter__: madwifi is no longer supported i believe, i mean it's alredy incluided in the kernel
[16:27] <fooman2011> ikonia: how that ? that's the wake on lan principle
[16:27] <edbian> anddam: Yes, write a script that launches all the games, write a launcher that calls the script

[16:27] <`alz1> thanks john
[16:28] <anddam> edbian: why should a script launch all the games?

=== administrator is now known as Guest32609
[16:28] <edbian> anddam: Because the launcher can only launch one command.
[16:28] <ikonia> fooman2011: yes, but halt is not "sleep" or a wol configuration
[16:28] <ikonia> Skunkwaffle: can you re-add it from the applets menu ?
[16:28] <xangua> Skunkwaffle: it's gone like, it not installed¿
[16:28] <Guest32609> hey
[16:28] <edbian> Guest32609: hello
[16:28] <fooman2011> ikonia: i mean Wake on lan = Turn ON PC from network
[16:28] <anddam> edbian: how do Application and Files&Folder work?
[16:28] <Skunkwaffle> it just tells me which packages contain it, but without a network connection, I can't install them
[16:28] <ikonia> fooman2011: yup, but if you "halt" the OS - then it's shutdown
[16:29] <johnnee> edbian, i can see the contents both in terminal and in the explorer like GUI
[16:29] <ikonia> fooman2011: so therefore it shouldn't effect WOL
[16:29] <edbian> anddam: How do applications work?
[16:29] <ikonia> fooman2011: the bios controls WOL

[16:29] <edbian> johnnee: Excellent.  sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/ /dev/sda
[16:29] <fooman2011> ikonia: yes because OS turn Off WOL be default to avoid security problems
[16:30] <llutz> ikonia: it has, since the nic has to be enabled to listen for magic-packets when shutting down OS
[16:30] <ikonia> fooman2011: yes, I'd expect halt to turn it off
[16:30] <edbian> anddam: Oh, umm, I'm not sure how it populates.  I'm sure it's documented if you google it. What are you trying to accomplish?
[16:30] <ikonia> llutz: yup, but as I was saying earlier, the "halt" command, I'd expect it to turn it off
[16:30] <fooman2011> ikonia: In my /etc/init/r/halt file i pu the NETDOWN parameter to "no"
[16:30] <anddam> edbian: have an icon to browse only a specific section rather than "All applications"
[16:31] <Skunkwaffle> Is there any kind of alternative way to connect, so I can download the packages I need to do this the usual way
[16:31] <llutz> ikonia: even "halt" runs scripts for system-shutdown
[16:31] <edbian> skrip: That guide does not appear to do sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer
[16:31] <TomSlominski> hello. i have problems with burning ubuntu to a usb disk in Fedora 15. when I burn it using livecd-iso-to-disk, I boot and get this: /casper/vmlinuz not found. when I use unetbootin, i get the same error but a different file is missing. i tried 2 different images, and both produced the same problems
[16:31] <ikonia> llutz: yes,
[16:31] <edbian> anddam: Ahhh, yeah that sounds possible
[16:31] <ikonia> fooman2011: not %100 relevant, but interesting http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/halt-breaks-wol-812422/
[16:31] <fooman2011> llutz: i tried to add my script where you told me => no effect :(
[16:31] <edbian> johnnee: What's it saying?
[16:32] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: did you try on the the command line on the terminal to see if networking works?
=== ng_ is now known as NG_
[16:32] <skrip> i had done  that manually :D
[16:32] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: I tried, I haven't been able to get anything to work though
[16:32] <edbian> skrip: Haha, that stinks
[16:33] <edbian> skrip: Should have come ask me sooner!!
[16:33] <edbian> ;)
[16:33] <fooman2011> ikonia: yeah thanks i have already tried this. But as i saied my WakeOnLan is OK when a user call explicitly the halt command. But when the cron call it the WakeOnLan is not OK...
[16:33] <Skunkwaffle> All I get is messages telling me which packages I need to install, but since I can't get online, I can't install the packages.

[16:33] <skrip> Thanks ! :D if i have any other problem i will ask .
[16:33] <llutz> fooman2011: works here on several systems fine (but all debian). whats "HALT" set to in /etc/default/halt?
[16:33] <s3r3n1t7> fooman2011, then i'd look at the differences in shutting down when the user calls halt and when it's called from cron. Perhaps some user setting enables WOL while cron skips it?
[16:33] <jaggy> oh ok thanks!
[16:33] <edbian> skrip: haha, sure
[16:33] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: can you try using the live-cd?
[16:34] <fooman2011> llutz: when i call "which halt" from my user i have "/sbin/halt"
[16:34] <ikonia> fooman2011: total long shot, I wonder if it's something to do with your enviornment, eg: yours is fine, but the cron user doesn't have a proper shell enviornment
[16:34] <fooman2011> llutz: I put /sbin/halt in my cron script
[16:34] <sahip> ikonia: 4650 seems compatible, there is no 4850
[16:34] <ikonia> sahip: there you go then
[16:34] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: I could, but I'm not sure how to extract the package from it
[16:34] <johnnee> edbian, can you teamviewer in my laptop?
[16:35] <s3r3n1t7> fooman2011, yes they both use the same halt executable, however it's not called from the same user, so as ikonia has stated the env might be different, thereby causing the problem.
[16:35] <edbian> johnnee: Nope.
[16:35] <fooman2011> raaah how to solve my problem ?
[16:35] <edbian> johnnee: Did the command produce errors?
[16:35] <johnnee> it's so hard to follow with so many people writing
[16:35] <jongbergs> TomSlominski: What OS you're using right now?
[16:35] <johnnee> so i haven't done anything yet
[16:35] <sidewalk> im having problems with openvpn not starting properly after reboot, looks like i have to run /etc/init.d/openvpn start, to get it working... anyone know what might be wrong? i followed the guide on the community page to get it working
[16:35] <johnnee> is there a way to private chat here
[16:36] <edbian> johnnee: I just did.

[16:37] <s3r3n1t7> EmuAlert, also make sure you are running sun java, not the default java that comes with Ubuntu
[16:37] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: Yes, give me a second though, have to go find a flash drive so I can copy it over to this computer
[16:37] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: ok..
[16:38] <EmuAlert> s3r3n1t7: Thanks. Also, Sun and OpenJDK run about the same

[16:38] <s3r3n1t7> EmuAlert, a forum post recommended to use sun java for MC, so i just took that route by default without really checking.

[16:52] <Who[ares> HI everyone, I know I've asked that question before but I still can't get any useful answer: I Tried to install Ubuntu 10.04 AND 11.04 with Wubi on my WinXP PC and even though the installation goes fine, I still dont have any Dual Boot menu showing up when I boot my PC ...... I've looked into the boot.ini windows file and I don,t see anything about ubuntu ... AND the Logfile doesn,t give me...
[16:52] <Who[ares> ...any error message: http://paste.ubuntu.com/614600/
[16:52] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: yeah, it's just not turned on, and there doesn't seem to be any way to do so
[16:52] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: can you try hooking up a utp cable?
[16:53] <aeon-ltd> Who[ares: should use the mbr to load ubuntu, or if you used wubi's other install method GRUB2 by default does not show
[16:53] <coz_> Who[ares,  not sure this works with wubi install,, however when you reboot hold down the left s hift key to see if the grub menu appears

[16:54] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: I tried hardwiring to the router, but that doesn't work either.
[16:55] <MonkeyDust> Who[ares: MBR = Master Boot Record
[16:55] <aeon-ltd> Who[ares: master boot record, its windows method of boot loading (so loading the OS)

[16:57] <f> someone tell me where can i get help with wine
[16:57] <sacton3> One of my IT guys at work and I are wanting to make a Linux distro to help replace Windows on these terrible Dell Slimlines that we have.  Most of our applications are HTML based and Java so compatibility should not be too much of a problem.  The PCs are P4's with 256m of ram.  Im think of baseing it off of either Xubuntu or Lubuntu.  Anyone have any suggestions, my main concerns are compatibility with a Windows user system and speed.
[16:57] <f> MonkeyDust, why not tell me where can i get help with wine instead of playing with ubottu
[16:57] <edbian> Who[ares: Actually :P  wubi does alter the MBR!!
[16:57] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: ok..what live-cd version do you have right now?
[16:57] <Who[ares> I see ! ... ;-)
[16:57] <Who[ares> I though it just modified the boot.ini file
[16:58] <MonkeyDust> sacton3: maybe you can discuss this in #ubuntu-devel
[16:58] <coz_> sacton3,  either of t hose DE's should be fine,,,  kde would be far more resource intensive than  xfce or lxde
[16:58] <Who[ares> and I also thought I could just manually modify boot.ini ...
[16:58] <coz_> sacton3,  the system I am on now is a P4 with one gig,, video  nvidia 7300gt
[16:58] <Skunkwaffle> Lucid 32 bit
[16:58] <Skunkwaffle> do you want the version number?
[16:58] <coz_> sacton3,  even ubuntu 11.04  runs fine on this
[16:58] <f> ubottu wine
[16:58] <ubottu> WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux - More information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine - Search the !AppDB for application compatibility ratings - Join #winehq for application help - See !virtualizers for running Windows (or another OS) inside Ubuntu
[16:59] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: no that's fine..were you able to connect from the live cd?
[16:59] <Who[ares> I'll try the left shift thing and I'll be back
[16:59] <coz_> sacton3,  one suggestion would be to download and burn the minimal install cd  which installs via the net   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD    it also , during the installation, give you choices for which DE  etc
[17:00] <BlackAndYellow_> do you guys know any good irc programms for the windows command line?
[17:00] <Skunkwaffle> Well I didn't live boot, I just installed from the CD, but, yes, I could originally connect. It was only after running the initial batch of updates and restarting that this problem began.
[17:00] <Who[ares> thanks for your help Coz_ and Monkeydust !
[17:00] <coz_> Who[ares,  did that work for you?
[17:00] <psycho_oreos> BlackAndYellow_, ask that in ##windows

[17:03] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: your ethernet card driver is r8169..let's try reloading it thru this command: sudo modprob -r r8169
[17:03] <pk__> i dont have a cd drive,neither a pen drive but have another computer
[17:03] <Lenin_Cat> I am currently trying to connect my networked printer over SMB, but it ask me to login to access my kodak printer, my printer does not have a username password or domain

[17:05] <MonkeyDust> edbian: you can install any client you like
[17:05] <ActionParsnip> coz_: weird
[17:05] <edbian> I know you can install one.  Is empathy the only one that is pre-installed?
[17:06] <IdleOne> edbian: the only one that sorta does irc yeah

[17:11] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: i mean, have you been using that cable?
[17:11] <nash__> How do I mount a partition as writable in a live usb?
[17:11] <b00zs> BTW I really dislike ubuntu 11.04!
[17:11] <MonkeyDust> b00zs: i'm on this chat through ssh
[17:11] <prezident> i just installed my vnc server client and im trying to connect from my other computer from somewhere else not just locally, my server says desktop is only reachable over the local network others can access your computer using the address localhost. is their any way i can change that ?
[17:12] <hypodermia> anybody know if there's a channel around for unity dev?
[17:12] <Skunkwaffle> Oh, I have not.
[17:13] <b00zs> Ubuntu 11.04's desktop setup is so annoying.
[17:13] <MonkeyDust> b00zs: i don't like it either, so i use gnome
[17:13] <compdoc> b00zs, ues the classic desktop then
[17:13] <prezident> b00zs y don't you just go baq to ubuntu classic mode when you log in
[17:14] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: how about a wireless network?
[17:14] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: okay looks like it's working now.
[17:14] <b00zs> prezident - One can choose desktop at login?
[17:14] <prezident> yeah
[17:14] <b00zs> Oh <3
[17:14] <b00zs> Thank GOD
[17:14] <b00zs> brb
[17:14] <prezident> lol :)
[17:14] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: did you replace the cable?
[17:14] <Skunkwaffle> The wireless still doesn't work, but I can get on with a cat-5
[17:14] <b00zs> :P

[17:14] <prezident> does anyone know how ot use vnc remote desktop
[17:14] <prezident> ?
[17:14] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: yes
[17:14] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: is it working right now?
=== jjjnbgvt is now known as rosebud9361
[17:15] <Skunkwaffle> yes, but only hardwired, I still can't connect through the wireless
[17:15] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: does the command sudo dhclient eth0 leases you and ip address?
[17:16] <lazy_TS> hello. this is Tom Slominski, except im too lazy to login :P
[17:16] <lazy_TS> i managed it, cheers!
[17:16] <Skunkwaffle> yes, but only through the hardwire
[17:16] <edbian> Skunkwaffle: what card do you have?
[17:17] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: can you connect to the internet?
[17:17] <Skunkwaffle> yes, as long as I'm plugged in
[17:18] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: i see..seems that network manager could be the culprit
[17:18] <Skunkwaffle> You wouldn't know how to fix that would you?

=== lilstevie is now known as lilstevie|ZNC
[17:18] <Mjuksel> lo guys
[17:18] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: google can help ;)
[17:19] <Mjuksel> can i add a swap partition after i installed ? :p
[17:19] <mdgeorge> how do I set my PATH system-wide?
[17:19] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: are you also researching right now?
[17:19] <mdgeorge> it is set correctly in /etc/environment
[17:19] <Skaperen> hmmm ... got this error from doing a cpio extraction:  "cpio: dev/raw1394: Cannot mknod: Invalid argument" ... ran it again with strace and found that it never even tried to do a mknod call
=== lilstevie|ZNC is now known as lilstevie
[17:19] <mdgeorge> but it seems to not be picked up
[17:19] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: yeah, just checking to see if you already knew the answer
[17:20] <mdgeorge> in particular I can't run anything in /usr/games from the run dialog :(
[17:20] <prezident> does any one know how to you the vnc server ?
[17:20] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: at least we were able to rule out the problem that prevents you from connecting to network
[17:21] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: i am searching also for an answer..
[17:21] <Skunkwaffle> yeah, thanks for getting me this far
[17:21] <compdoc> prezident, there's two type of vnc server. one is called vino, and comes already installed I think
[17:21] <asatorlenormand> hi :)
[17:22] <Mjuksel> whats the easiest way to resize my partition guys
[17:22] <antihero> Hey, with Unity, how do I access Wine programs?
[17:22] <Mjuksel> i only have USB on this computer
[17:22] <antihero> some are not showing up
[17:22] <Mjuksel> need to resize my root partition
[17:23] <compdoc> prezident, vino shares your desktop, and runs on port 5900. You have to be logged in on the console to make it work.
[17:23] <Skaperen> Mjuksel: is there a partition in use at the space just above the root partition?
[17:23] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: okay I'm installing the network-manager-gnome package. Let's see if this does anything
[17:24] <prezident> my server the desktop im trying to connect to says that i can connect only locally and i want to change that
[17:24] <Mjuksel> no Skaperen i accidently used all of the hard disk on install
[17:24] <wendico> Hello, another problem is that this chat window gets longer and longer as i tipe long senteced, how to keep in in a fixed size?
[17:24] <Mjuksel> forgot to add a swap part
[17:24] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: ok let me know how it works out..
[17:24] <Skaperen> Mjuksel: you want to make it smaller?
[17:25]  * Skaperen suggests a "do over" ... have a system partition (all but /home), a swap, and a /home partition (large)
[17:25] <Mjuksel> yes Skaperen
[17:26] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: not so good, looks like it can't retrieve system settings properties now
[17:26] <yeastwars> sound's been really weak ever since I upgraded from intrepid to whatever m* is. Any ideas why?
[17:26] <Skaperen> system partition could be as small as 8GB, depending on what packages you add
[17:26] <yeastwars> alsamixer shows full bars everywhere, yet I can barely hear anything
[17:26] <Skunkwaffle> I'm going to restart and see if that helps anything
[17:26] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: could you pastebin the output?
[17:27] <Skaperen> Mjuksel: back up your data, first, on 2 external USB drives
[17:27] <Skaperen> always make 2 backups when intending to erase the live data
[17:27] <Skaperen> or more
[17:28] <Mjuksel> okay but Skaperen , i had this major trouble with installing my USB Wifi stick
[17:28] <Skunkwaffle> jongbergs: I didn't save it, but I'll try again when it restarts
[17:28] <Mjuksel> can i somehow backup that driver ? i did a make + make install
[17:28] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: ok no problem..hope everything will went fine..
[17:29] <Skunkwaffle> Ah, it seems that did it
[17:30] <Skunkwaffle> thanks jongbergs, looks like I'm back in business
[17:30] <Skaperen> Mjuksel: you might be able to back it up ... if you can find the files, make a copy of them into /home in some place, and make the external backup of /home with it
[17:31] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: seems that network manager must have failed during the update..
[17:31] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: Congratulations! you did it!
[17:31] <Skunkwaffle> yeah I guess so. Thanks for helping me
[17:31] <Skaperen> Mjuksel: if you did make;make install then you would also have source ... still have that?  back it up, too
[17:31] <jongbergs> Skunkwaffle: It's my pleasure :)
[17:32] <Skaperen> Mjuksel: best to redo the make+make install ... for practice
[17:32] <Skaperen> Mjuksel: keep good notes on what you do, and install decisions you make ... handy for redo

[17:46] <StevenSS> I need pcre.h to compile something. Where and how do I get it?
[17:46] <MonkeyDust> farmer_: there's a ppa for gnome3
[17:48] <nit-wit> Iraqi, Sketchup Google has no linux installs, using a windows setup is your best chance I think . There is wine but personally  wouldn't even mess with that.
[17:48] <farmer_> MonkeyDust, thanks anyway, I googled it
[17:49] <Iraqi> nit-wit: by wine hq is need .NET Framwork 2 must installing then will install it so is there .NET framwork 2 for linux?
[17:50] <_Lucifer> not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but if one were to have the source code of a windows driver for a piece of hardware not supported in linux, how hard would it be to convert to a linux usable state?
[17:50] <Shnookie> Iraqi: Mono is the Linux version of . net framework

[17:51] <s3r3n1t7> chaos_, it links here
[17:51] <chaos_> s3r3n1t7: yeah,now i see that
[17:52] <smw> _Lucifer, depends, if you know what you are doing, it would be semi-hard. If you don't, it would be impossible :-\
[17:53] <Enissay> Is there any way to make 1080p videos work correctly on a Pentium M 1400 MHZ 1GB ram?
[17:53] <s3r3n1t7> _Lucifer, you would have to rewrite all the system calls from the windows parts to their linux counter parts, write functions should they not exist. Hardly recommendable.
[17:54] <_Lucifer> smw: ah. I won't try then, I have no idea how to do it, I don't actually have the source code yet but the developer said he would provide it upon request, and the hardware probably isn't common enough for anyone who knows what they are doing to bother with
[17:54] <hypatia> Enissay: your only hope would be if it has a good vudeo card
[17:54] <smw> _Lucifer, what hardware is it?
[17:55] <Enissay> hydh, I dont think so, It Is an integrated intel stuff
[17:55] <L_infty> Is there a way to specify on which desktop you an application to start?
[17:55] <smw> _Lucifer, http://www.linuxdriverproject.org/foswiki/bin/view
[17:55] <Enissay> hypatia, I dont think so, It Is an integrated intel stuff
[17:55] <hypatia> Enissay: probably no luck then :(
[17:55] <Enissay> xD
[17:55] <_Lucifer> smw: it's the headset adapter for the original xbox controller. the controller itself works perfectly, but the headset doesn't
[17:55] <hypatia> laptop or desktop?
[17:55] <Enissay> laptop
[17:56] <RA_drc> _Lucifer: why don't you get the source code anyway, and post i t online?
[17:56] <VCoolio> L_infty: compiz place plugin can do that, if you use compiz, else have a look at devilspie
[17:56] <smw> _Lucifer, maybe someone at the open drivers project will take a look?
[17:56] <smw> _Lucifer, linux drivers project*
[17:56] <hypatia> yeah, not gonna happen Enissay - to do 1080p on that kinda proc, you need video card acceleration
[17:57] <Enissay> hypatia, what about 720p vids?
[17:57] <RA_drc> smw: where is this linux drivers project?
[17:58] <smw> RA_drc, http://www.linuxdriverproject.org/foswiki/bin/view

[18:00] <Curly_Q> Hey guys is there an apt-get for bahamut 1.8.9 release?
[18:00] <hypatia> glad to help, Enissay
[18:00] <hypatia> Enissay: fwiw, you want mplayer's vdpau option when you're dealing with low power but accelerated video
[18:02] <RA_drc> smw: thanks
[18:03] <yunosh> hi, should /lib/security be a symlink to /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security? (on 64bit of course)?
[18:03] <Enissay> hypatia, didnt get it?
[18:05] <StevenSS> How do I search for files from the commandline?
=== efortis is now known as e40
[18:06] <rumpel1> StevenSS, locate or find
[18:06] <hypatia> Enissay: if you're doing video on a machne with a crappy processor but a good video card, you can use mplayer's vdpau option to run the video decodinf on the video card :)
[18:06] <wurmt0ngue> there are alot of options to the command StevensSS but its the find command
[18:06] <Curly_Q> StevenSS use the grep command.
[18:06] <StevenSS> find or grep? Which is better?
[18:07] <Curly_Q> Use locate command too.
[18:07] <Pwer> StevenSS, try locate for a filesystem search.
[18:07] <wurmt0ngue> im not familiar with grep, locate and find ive seen
[18:07] <wurmt0ngue> but they have many options
[18:07] <Enissay> hypatia, ow, I see... but it's not my case... coz the whole laptop is crap lol
[18:07] <hypatia> Enissay: yeah, sorry it doesn't help with that :(
[18:08] <Enissay> hypatia, ow, u certainly did with these informations :)
[18:08] <QuikNik> Anybody here used a Moto Xoom tablet with Ubuntu or any distro for that matter?  I can't seem to see the volume mounting on the desktop at all and nothing shows up with fdisk
[18:08] <hypatia> Enissay: for reference, i use a very low-powered Atom machine for my TV PC, and it decodes 1080P perfectly with mplayer :)
[18:09] <Curly_Q> If you use the grep command you can use the |    pipe command with it.
[18:10] <melow01> I'm trying to Benchmark a drive using Ubuntu's Disk Utility but I get "write benchmarking requires the disk to be completely empty". I used /dev/urandom to write random data to the drive so I thought my partitions were gone?
[18:10] <Enissay> hypatia, cool :)
[18:11] <Curly_Q> Melow01 are you working on a data recovery project?
[18:12] <melow01> kinda
[18:12] <melow01> Curly_Q, kinda
[18:12] <heyguise> hey guys. Can any one link me to a tutorial about how to install a windows xp partion if I allready have an ubuntu partion installed? I've done clean multipartion installs but i really dont want to have to format my hard drive. Thanks.
[18:12] <ActionParsnip> hypatia: mplayer is the daddy :)
[18:12] <Curly_Q> What is the scoop?
[18:12] <hypatia> ActionParsnip: it is pretty sweet, indeed!
[18:12] <ActionParsnip> heyguise: the liveCD can resize the ext4 partition which you can then install windows to
[18:13] <hypatia> heyguise: if you install windows after linux, you'll have to reinstall grub- that's the only tricky part
[18:13] <Curly_Q> Heyquise Windows is a pig it wants the entire disk.
[18:13] <TomSlominski> hi. im trying to delete my swap partition, but Palimpsest is all like "refusing to delete a protected partition" so i was like "swapoff -a" but i still can't do it
[18:13] <hypatia> and it's not actually very tricky
[18:13] <melow01> Curly_Q, I was trying dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdb on large drive (500GB) but it was taking too long, so I'm experimenting with a 128MB sdcard and that command worked
[18:13] <hypatia> melow01: you need to set the block size
[18:13] <heyguise> action parsnip. I was reading about that. I currently have ubuntu installed on this laptop. I read that installing windows after ubuntu can mess up the MBR.
[18:14] <hypatia> heyguise: it will, but it's trivial to fix
[18:14] <melow01> Curly_Q, I would like to benchmark my drives to see if they're good for future use
[18:14] <ActionParsnip> heyguise: yes but the livecD can also reinstate grub to the mbr, so its no worry
[18:14] <wildc4rd> evening all
[18:14] <heyguise> awesome
[18:14] <heyguise> thank you guys
[18:14] <melow01> hypatia, I also did this: dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdb bs=512 skip=1
[18:14] <TomSlominski> i tried formatting that parition to ext4 but it still doesnt work. i restarted palimpsest, should i restart my computer?
[18:14] <heyguise> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows <--- correct?
[18:15] <hypatia> melow01: how long did you wait?  500gb will take many hours
[18:15] <hypatia> melow01: i'd estimate on the order of 5-10
[18:15] <hypatia> heyguise: yup!
[18:15] <heyguise> thanks
[18:16] <melow01> hypatia, ya I found out last night. I Ctrl-C this morning and it told me 115GB took 12 hours!  That's why I'm tinkering with a 128MB sdcard now.
[18:16] <Curly_Q> Melow01 there is a good software called:   SpinRite   check that out. You will be amazed at it.
[18:17] <melow01> hypatia, Curly_Q I'd like to test the integrity of my 500GB drive before I put it back into my ReadyNAS and load all my personal data onto it.
[18:17] <Blue_Helix> can someone help me with booting from USB ?
[18:18] <heyguise> Sorry about all the questions i just odnt wanna fuck this up. So I insert my ubuntu live cd, create a partion for my windows install. Remove the live cd, insert my windows cd and install it on the appropirate partion. Then reinsert the ubuntu live cd and reinstall GRub?
[18:19] <hypatia> heyguise: that is correct
[18:19] <ActionParsnip> Blue_Helix: set the usb to be first boot in bios
[18:19] <heyguise> thank ya
[18:19] <hypatia> melow01: i would just run the extended SMART test from disk utility
[18:19] <L_infty> .quit
[18:19] <Curly_Q> Melow01 the integrity of your hard disk today will not be the same as tomorrow. If it works don't try to fix it.
[18:20] <heyguise> i love how ubuntus support. Random dudes on the internet blow "John From Dallas" with a strange indian accents tech support out of the water.
[18:20] <melow01> hypatia, Curly_Q I suppose my question is... if I wrote random data to the drive using dd, why is there still partitions on the drive?
[18:20] <BobTheGreat> how do I install 2.6.38-3 on 11.04 without getting all the unstable packages while at the same time not diabling kernel updates?
[18:20] <hypatia> melow01: i have no idea :(
[18:20] <BajK> whgat is that "Install updates after installing" supposed to do anyway? EVERYTIME i install kubuntu I check this box and still I get like 150 updates when doing apt-get upgrade
[18:21] <melow01> hypatia, ok
[18:21] <ActionParsnip> BajK: i wondered that too, i just ignore it now
[18:21] <Curly_Q> Melow01 did you format the drive? and did you partition the drive first?
[18:22] <BobTheGreat> I meant 2.6.39-3! I need that to be newer than the other stuff.
[18:22] <nit-wit> BajK, the updates and upgrades bring the OS to the latest version.
[18:22] <SpaceBass> hey folks
[18:22] <BajK> nit-wit: huh?
[18:22] <BajK> bring what to where? :D

[18:22] <SpaceBass> anyone using eccryptfs? I've tried creating a new user with --encrypt-home per the wiki, however, when that user logs in (via CLI) they cannot write to their ~/
[18:23] <BobTheGreat> ActionParsnip, thanks, I'll search for it.
[18:23] <hypatia> SpaceBass: if they log in via cli they have to mount their home
[18:23] <nit-wit> BajK,  you said " whgat is that "Install updates after installing" supposed to do anyway?" I said  the updates and upgrades bring the OS to the latest version.
[18:23] <BajK> so if you run 10.10 setup you will end up at 11.04?
[18:23] <IdleOne> no
[18:24] <SpaceBass> hypatia, when I try 'ecryptfs-mount-private' I get an error saying its not conjured properly
[18:24] <IdleOne> the updates will install any security/bug fixes
[18:24] <SpaceBass> hypatia, is there a way to auto mount at login?
[18:24] <ActionParsnip> BajK: it only gets the packages for 10.10 to the latest on the repos
[18:24] <nit-wit> BajK, only if you choose to upgrade to it=11.04
[18:24] <BajK> ActionParsnip: then it is broken :D
[18:24] <BajK> jus tinstalled 11.04 and I still got 150 updates at first start
[18:24] <hypatia> SpaceBass: not sure, sorry :(
[18:24] <ActionParsnip> BajK: it's not, there is a world of difference
[18:25] <ActionParsnip> BajK: ohh., sorry
[18:25] <IdleOne> BajK: there has been many updates to 11.04 since release
[18:25] <BajK> and?
[18:25] <BajK> doesnt change that it does not apply the updates
[18:25] <Rohn> Hi all
[18:25] <Curly_Q> Melow01 it all depends upon if you did a Low Level Format or not.
[18:25] <ActionParsnip> BajK: yes it is, but I ignore it,log a bug if you desire
[18:25] <xskydevilx> The proprietary drivers for my nVidia graphics cards aren't showing up. Only the experimental open source ones. How do I get the proprietary ones to show up?
[18:25] <BajK> ActionParsnip: you ignore it?
[18:26] <ActionParsnip> BajK: yes, getting fullupdates is part of my post install script
[18:26] <BajK> and why doesnt it do that? :D
[18:26] <nit-wit> BajK, if you use the alternative disc install you will be up to date upon installation.
[18:26] <melow01> Curly_Q, before I started working on the 128MB sdcard, it was inside a Canon camera with fat32 formatted onto it.  Then, I ran dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdb bs=512 skip=1. I was thinking that would be low-level format?
[18:27] <BajK> and again: *adds a list to the 50 reasons the Kubuntu installer su... is broken*
[18:27] <hypatia> melow01: running dd on something is not  low0level formatting

=== Catabriga is now known as Cata
[18:28] <melow01> hypatia, Curly_Q I was just reading on SpinRite's website that on newer drives its almost impossible to do a low-level format nowadays because of the way the drive was setup at the manufacturer.
[18:29] <hypatia> melow01: spinrite is garbage, don't believe anything Steve Gibson says.
[18:29] <melow01> hypatia, Curly_Q there also seems to be conflicting info out there about what "low level formatting" actually is.
[18:29] <hypatia> melow01: it's also not necessary on new drives
[18:29] <BobTheGreat> i don't understand how to "add ppa:kernel-ppa/ppa to sources". Isn't sources meant to be like "deb http://..."?
[18:30] <hypatia> BobTheGreat: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:....
[18:30] <hypatia> BobTheGreat: try that (but with the right ppa name)
[18:30] <melow01> hypatia, ok, but back to my original question: why can't I run a Read/Write Benchmark from Ubuntu's Disk Utility?
[18:30] <BobTheGreat> ok, and that will add the newer kernels to synaptic?
[18:30] <hypatia> melow01: "low level formatting" doesn't tell you much about the health of the drive
[18:30] <hypatia> melow01: i'm not sure about that one :/
[18:31] <melow01> hypatia, ok, thanks anyway
[18:31] <hypatia> BobTheGreat: after an apt-get update, yes
[18:31] <ActionParsnip> BobTheGreat: you can use add-apt-repository to add it easier
[18:31] <BobTheGreat> thanks!
[18:31] <hypatia> melow01: try "smart data" then self-test
[18:32] <hypatia> more useful than benchmarking if you mainly want to know the health of the drive
[18:32] <hypatia> oh actually, melow01
[18:32] <rewalsar> QUESTION: How to edit .conf file?
[18:32] <melow01> hypatia, where would I do a smart data self test?
[18:32] <ActionParsnip> BobTheGreat: use the bold text and it will add
[18:32] <ActionParsnip> rewalsar: in a text editor
[18:32] <hypatia> melow01: if the drive is mounted, that's why read/write won't work
[18:32] <hypatia> melow01: also in disk utility
[18:33] <nit-wit> BajK, It is always so refreshing to see people who have little understanding of the Linux or Ubuntu setups compiling list of bugs, this will work against you .

[18:51] <IdleOne> bullgard4: I don't know either. I suggest asking in #oo.org perhaps
[18:52] <bullgard4> IdleOne: That channel is pretty idle.
[18:52] <IdleOne> bullgard4: maybe #libreoffice or try OO.o forums perhaps
[18:53] <ikonia> isn't it #openoffice.org ?
[18:53] <ikonia> as I told you earlier bullgard4
[18:54] <IdleOne> ah, perhaps it is that.
[18:55] <rewalsar> IdleOne: Just don't do that again. Who the F are you to decide whether its legal or illegal. If I had to attack, I can do that well in windows too. There are numbers of software for that in windows. Just change your thinking. and don't reply to this, I don't want to hear anything.

[19:15] <edbian> phong_: echo $myString      if myString is a bash variable
[19:15] <phong_> edbian, what about i want to echo my own word
[19:15] <llutz> phong_: echo $PATH
[19:16] <phong_> echo "hello world" ?
=== knitt1 is now known as knittl
[19:16] <edbian> phong_: echo #variableName

[19:16] <phong_> ok thanks
[19:16] <XuMuK> hi there
[19:16] <edbian> Usuario: I suggested twice to add Dexter to the admin group
[19:16] <phong_> single or double quote?
[19:16] <sudokill> Usuario, sudo nano /etc/sudoers      add this line: dexter ALL=(ALL) ALL           press ctrl+X then press Y to save
[19:16] <Usuario> edbian, the I didnt understand
[19:16] <XuMuK> all my links opens in ff and i'd like chrome...
[19:16] <edbian> Usuario: no hard feelings :)
[19:16] <XuMuK> how should i change it?
[19:17] <edbian> sudokill: Usuario ActionParsnip adding Dexter to the admin group is the prefered method
[19:17] <edbian> sudokill: And you should use visudo to avoid syntax errors
[19:17] <BobTheGreat> I just updated to kernel 2.6.39 in order to get my wifi working. Then wifi stopped working completely, and is still in this state when I returned to 2.6.38. WTF I thought the atleast the install/uninstall problem of installing and uninstalling stuff was solved. Why is this so messy. Do I have to reinstall everything now?
[19:17] <ActionParsnip> sudokill: also visudo should be used, not nano
[19:18] <sudokill> same thing
=== quem_ is now known as quem
[19:18] <edbian> BobTheGreat: What card do you have?
[19:18] <sudokill> visudo is safer
[19:18] <Usuario> please, not so fast, I can hardly follow you all: I have just typed usermod -a -G admin dexter, now what?
[19:18] <phong_> is ubuntu better then MAc os X?
[19:18] <sudokill> but nano is fine if ur not a complete idiot
[19:18] <edbian> sudokill: Yes. visudo is safer, that's why you should use it.
[19:18] <ActionParsnip> BobTheGreat: no, just boot to the official kernel and remove the kernel you added and remove the ppa
[19:18] <edbian> sudokill: It doesn't take a complete idiot to make a typo
[19:18] <BobTheGreat> rtl8191se
[19:18] <sudokill> ur changing one line
[19:18] <edbian> phong_: That's opinion but.  yes
[19:18] <ActionParsnip> phong_: better is an opinion, so never concrete
[19:18] <sudokill> all u have to do is read it
[19:19] <BobTheGreat> ActionParsnip, did that. problem worse then before.
[19:19] <nit-wit> phong_, that would be a personal preference don't you think?
[19:19] <phong_> yeah
[19:19] <ActionParsnip> sudokill: why mess a file when there is a group to easily get access, the user currently cannot edit it as they aren't able to use sudo....
[19:19] <edbian> BobTheGreat: What card do you use?
[19:19] <ActionParsnip> phong_: it's as intelligent as asking if red is better than blue
[19:19] <sudokill> Action u could do it from another user
[19:20] <threexk> how do you restore gconf settings to their defaults?  I accidentally clicked some things
[19:20] <BobTheGreat> edbian, it is a realtek in an asus u31. rtl8191se
[19:20] <Usuario> sudokill, I accessed the sudoers file, where do I have to paste that line? bottom?
[19:20] <sudokill> yes anywhere
[19:20] <sudokill> on a new line
[19:20] <Usuario> sudokill Im writting it right below root
[19:20] <ActionParsnip> sudokill: true, considering the clear level of ability, wouldn't adding a user to a group be more appropriate than having them manually edit VERY sensitive files?
[19:20] <BobTheGreat> uname -k now says: #42-Ubuntu <somedate>
[19:21] <Usuario> sudokill, file name to write same one?
[19:21] <sudokill> Usuario, tell me what u wrote before u save it
[19:21] <BobTheGreat> edbian, what do you mean by card?
[19:21] <threexk> nevermind, I figured out how to view a history
[19:22] <Usuario> sudokill, waht yopu told me to: dexter  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
[19:22] <sudokill> Usuario, yes just do ctrl+x then press y then press enter
[19:22] <edbian> BobTheGreat: The wifi card.  (your answer was sufficient).  I don't think i can help
[19:22] <BobTheGreat> ok
[19:22] <sudokill> Usuario, yea thats fine save it as same name

[19:22] <edbian> Usuario: Now dexter can sudo
[19:22] <BobTheGreat> how do I atleast have the system return to the state it was in before installing the new kernel?
[19:23] <ActionParsnip> BobTheGreat: I told you already...
[19:24] <BobTheGreat> ActionParsnip, I guess I did that, but now wifi doesn't even list ap's.
[19:24] <Usuario> edbian sudokill  moving to sudo chmod 755 /home/dexter
[19:24] <BobTheGreat> how do I check the version of the kernel I am using?
[19:25] <ActionParsnip> BobTheGreat: uname -a
[19:25] <edbian> Usuario: k
[19:25] <ActionParsnip> BobTheGreat: you will need to reboot to the older kernel
[19:25] <BobTheGreat> it says 2.6.38-8-generic
[19:25] <Usuario> edbian, I dont recall if you have been helping me with my ICEauthority problem
[19:26] <ActionParsnip> BobTheGreat: that is the official natty kernel
[19:26] <edbian> Usuario: I was not but I suspect that the problem is that the file is not owned by dexter.  dexter probably did not need to become a sudoer
[19:26] <BobTheGreat> yes, but before I changed and reverted the change, wifi listed ap's. Now it doesn't.
[19:27] <inso> Anyone here who's got some experience with Code::Blocks? I can
[19:27] <Usuario> edbian, rebooting

[19:31] <Usuario> edbian sudokill more help needed, I still get the f*cking ICEauthority problem, but at least I can see my ubuntu GUI, now I am prompted to enter a password to unlock my login keyring, because the password I use to log in the computer no longer matches that of my login keyring
[19:32] <dwightschrute> Hello guys! In 10.04 I had the option to open the windows that were open at the time of the last shutdown/reboot but I can't find that option in 11.04!? How can I activate such a feature?
[19:32] <edbian> Usuario: who owns the ICEAuthority file?
[19:33] <BobTheGreat> Linux is such total shit. There always the tinkering, halfsolved problem. Even windows XP is lighyears ahead. Never had an unproblematic wifi connection under linux. I seems like the install/uninstall are not consistent, ever. The fresh install is nice, but once you start adjusting it to your needs it quickly turns to unreliable, ad-hoc, bullshit. Had to be said.

[19:33] <EvoGamer> BobTheGreat, no it didn't have to be said
[19:33] <Usuario> edbian dexter I guess, I dont see that file, I have tried to unlock yhis password pop up with both passwords, but none works

[19:34] <edbian> Usuario: I'm not sure how to fix the keyring thing.  First things first.  ls -l ~/.ICEauthority

[19:36] <ranjan> BobTheGreat, ask the hardware vendors to give the details of hardware instead of burrying it in their ass. You will see drivers better than the proprietary evolving
[19:36] <dwightschrute> edbian: there is no admin -> session in 11.04, but I remember that there was one in 10.04 and that's where I had enabled the option to reopen the windows
[19:37] <BobTheGreat> BlouBlou, yes actually I did. How do I restore kernel/wifi to "factory settings" in 11.04?
