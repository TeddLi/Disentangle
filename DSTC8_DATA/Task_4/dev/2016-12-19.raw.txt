This script is started by cron hourly. This is causing several pids to stack up of the script.I have tried using the '&' to background it like i would from the CLI....

[08:13] <alkisg> Hi, I'm trying to print on a hp laserjet cp1515n on Ubuntu 16.04, and I'm getting "data" instead of normal printouts, like "JZJZ4$ZZ on top + empty page". This worked fine in previous Ubuntu versions. Other HP printers work fine in 16.04. So I'm suspecting an issue with the .ppd file?
[08:15] <hateball> alkisg: what driver are you using? perhaps the wizard picked the wrong one for you
[08:15] <alkisg> hateball: I tried with the jetdirect one, and with the dnssd one
[08:16] <alkisg> (both do mention the correct printer name of course)
[08:16] <hateball> alkisg: by jetdirect, you mean the hpijs driver?
=== jz is now known as Guest45138
[08:16] <alkisg> hateball: so, I click on add network printer. I get two options, one to add the printer via ip on port 9100 as an appsockete/hp jetdirect printer,
[08:17] <yellabs-r2> thanks for the tip , impressive is a cool program, some one should take time to write a gui for it ..
[08:17] <alkisg> hateball:  and another one to add it via dns-sd, so I select that second one in case the printer ip changes
[08:17] <yellabs-r2> but for now , i can slide show any pdf file , nice !
[08:17] <hateball> alkisg: either should be fine, but you should be able to pick driver as well
[08:17] <hateball> alkisg: or if the wizard does that for you, at least be able to edit the one used
[08:17] <alkisg> hateball: then I get the driver selection dialog, and I select HP => Color LaserJet CP1215 (suggested) foomatic/foo2hp
[08:18] <hateball> alkisg: do you have any other options? like hpijs
[08:18] <alkisg> No, I only have 1 option there
[08:18] <hateball> alkisg: do you have hplip installed ?
[08:18] <alkisg> hateball: hrm, while typing it, I noticed "1215" vs "1515" which is the printer model
[08:19] <alkisg> hateball: hmm, it's "state=rc" for unknown reason... thanks, installing...
[08:22] <alkisg> hateball: thank you very much, printing works fine now, will investigate why hplip was in "rc" state. :) You're great!

[08:34] <ooxi> I'm running Ubuntu 16.04, should I use syslog or journald for logging of my docker container?
[08:34] <ooxi> which does ubuntu use by default for other services?
[08:35] <ikonia> they do the same thing and can be used in conjunction
[08:35] <ikonia> you can use journald to log to syslog for example
[08:36] <ooxi> @ikonia yes but which should be the primary target?
[08:37] <ikonia> up to you
[08:37] <ooxi> or does ubuntu not have one and some services use syslog while other use journald?
[08:37] <ikonia> there isn't a rule

[08:48] <Ben64> no

[10:44] <everson> Hi all, using 16.04 desktop, I have multiple terminals open that are SSHd into different servers. In old versions of Ubuntu I would see window "titles" in the taskbar with the server names, ie: everson@freenode, everson@othernode, etc. - but now I can't, and having to alt-tab is getting a bit frustrating. Any tips on how to get the window titles to display in the taskbar again? Thanks
[10:45] <koroso> i open this file with libreoffice is it possible that is the problem?
[10:46] <DHEGLENK> http://paste.ubuntu.com/23652825/
[10:47] <ikonia> the problem is line 1 has bad info it it
[10:48] <koroso> http://paste.ubuntu.com/23652816/ can you verify please and tell me because i dont see any error
[10:48] <ikonia> koroso: that is not the default ubuntu config file
[10:48] <ikonia> where has that come from
[10:49] <koroso> i just change Port
[10:49] <avellanedas> morning people
[10:49] <ikonia> koroso: I'd be looking for hidden caracters
[10:49] <ikonia> koroso: visually it looks fine
[10:49] <ikonia> koroso: what text editor did you change it in
[10:49] <koroso> ok thank you
[10:50] <avellanedas> fucking freaks
[10:50] <koroso> libreoffice
[10:50] <koroso> maybe that is the error
[10:50] <koroso> i must have use notepad
[10:51] <koroso> since i change port with libreoffice it doesnt work anymore
[10:51] <ikonia> koroso: have you found the hidden chars ?
[10:51] <koroso> i will see
[10:53] <koroso> how can i do it?
[10:54] <Ben64> maybe you saved it strangely
[10:54] <Ben64> i'd suggest using something more basic, like nano
[10:55] <ikonia> wise words Ben64
[11:00] <koroso> can i just remove /etc/ssh/sshd_config and reinstall it?
[11:01] <koroso> because i dont know how to find hidden char
[11:02] <sruli> koroso:  "sudo apt-get remove --purge ssh" then "sudo apt install ssh"
[11:02] <guest> that should be openssh-server not "ssh"
[11:04] <sruli> Guest: are you sure? that config looks like ssh client to me
[11:04] <guest> sshd_config is the ssh daemon (that's what the d stands for)
[11:04] <koroso> ok thank u sruli i try it

[11:06] <Filystyn> i don't care how bad idea it is

[11:11] <Arrghus> I have a computer with a 15GB SSD and a 1TB HDD. Would there be any problems with installing Ubuntu on the SSD and using the HDD for file storage (asking because 15GB is below recommended disk size for 16.04.01)?
[11:11] <Filystyn> but you helped me thank you
[11:11] <Filystyn> God Bless
[11:12] <Arrghus> Or is there some other alternative I should know about?
[11:12] <guest> Arrghus: should be OK, just be aware the automatic partitioning will put a swap partition on the root drive, so you won't have access to the full 15GiB
[11:12] <FinalX> Arrghus: depends on your setup and what you're using it for. Ubuntu server can be a few hundred MB's, Desktops take a lot more, and if you want to upgrade it's also advisable to have a lot more. You can also mount partitions of the 1TB in system places as well.
[11:12] <guest> Arrghus: you could use custom partitioning to put the /home directory on the extra drive
[11:13] <Arrghus> Desktop.
[11:13] <sruli> Arrghus: if you set your /home partition on the 1tb should work fine (might want to skip the swap or put that on the 1tb too)
[11:13] <FinalX> on my server I'm using 16.04 on a 16 GB SLC stick, and that uses 4.4 GB now. everything else is on other drives, incl LXC-containers etc.
[11:13] <Arrghus> Moving /home to the HDD seems sensible.
[11:14] <Arrghus> Good to know, means I don't have to fiddle around trying to modify the laptop if I want that SSD speed. Thanks people.
[11:15] <LinuxNovice> hello, anybody online here? I needed some help in choosing a suitable DE for my old laptop. which one is more suited for it Mate or XFCE?
[11:15] <CrazyH> does anyone know how to get the multiple workspaces working in Ubuntu 16.04? I've tried everything that the Web has to offer. None of it works :-(
[11:16] <guest> LinuxNovice: Either are better than Unity for older machines. IMO Ubuntu MATE edition.
[11:17] <sruli> CrazyH: what is the problem exactly?
[11:17] <LinuxNovice> But, I have heard that Xfce is more lightweight. Why do you prefer Mate?
[11:18] <LinuxNovice> Is there any advantage of using Mate over Xfce?
[11:18] <guest> Because I liked Ubuntu 10.04 and want to continue using it with a more up to date version of Firefox :P
[11:18] <guest> They really are much the same
[11:18] <guest> Why not download both and try them out in a live environment?
[11:18] <CrazyH> sruli, I right click on workspace swither and click preferences. I tell it that I want 8 workspaces showed in 1 row. I click close. Nothing happens. When I re-visit preferences I see that it has ignored what I told it and reset to default. I tried enabling workspaces under Appeareance settings. Made no differenace. I tried installing / running compiz manager. Made no difference.
[11:18] <LinuxNovice> I am new to Linux. I have this old laptop which came with WinXP.
[11:19] <guest> Xubuntu might be slightly more lightweight but there isn't much in it. The layout of MATE is just more familiar to me.
[11:19] <guest> how much RAM does the laptop have LinuxNovice ?
[11:20] <CrazyH> sruli, I'm running a brand new install of ubuntu 16.04 64 bit with gnome flashback / compiz session
[11:20] <LinuxNovice> 2gb RAM.
[11:20] <guest> either will be fine.
[11:20] <guest> go with the one you prefer the look of.
[11:20] <LinuxNovice> It has Intel Celeron M Single core processor with 1.5 GHz, 2 gb RAM, and 40 gb hdd.
[11:21] <CrazyH> sruli, I'm upgrading from Ubuntu 12.04. All of this worked in 12.04, so something changed that broke it between 12.x and 16.x :-/
[11:21] <LinuxNovice> Is RAM the only consideration?
[11:21] <LinuxNovice> what about processor?
[11:21] <guest> pretty much yes
[11:21] <guest> There's not much more info I can give you LinuxNovice
[11:21] <guest> download each and try them from a USB
[11:22] <sruli> CrazyH: dont know in gnome
[11:22] <CrazyH> sruli, is there a way to trouble shoot it? Is there a log file that workspace switcher writes to or something like that?
[11:23] <sruli> CrazyH: i've never really used workspace switcher, not sure, someone else might be able to help?
[11:24] <LinuxNovice> I tried other distros like Peppermint OS. When doing multiple tasks the maximum RAM consumed doesn't exceep 1GB and I have 2 GBs of RAM. But, the CPU usage reaches 100% most of the times and the system becomes slow.

[11:30] <thesha> how do i bring back a file in original after i made the changes using git?
[11:31] <guest> thesha: have you committed the file?
[11:31] <ubunbo> hello
[11:32] <thesha> guest: i use git commit -s -v
[11:32] <guest> thesha: just help me understand: you made a change to the file, then staged the change for commit using "git add", then you committed the change with "git commit" ?
[11:33] <ubunbo> I having a problem with the sound card
[11:34] <ubunbo> I restart the time did not pull out headphones, and then the volume control which can not see my sound card
[11:34] <ubunbo> ubuntu 16.04
[11:35] <thesha> guest: i remove braces then i staged it using git add and after that i use git commit -s -v then i checked again , it was causing extra blank line so i gone to the code and remove the single blank line and save it .now i want the file as it was earlier
[11:35] <pronet> Download Alsa Mixer. > Enable Jack sense
[11:36] <guest> thesha: type "git log" you will see a list of commits and their IDs. IDs look like this ff317501a500dd9ab0841339fd098ae3c49614ca
[11:36] <thesha> ok
[11:36] <thesha> yes and after that
[11:36] <guest> thesha: check out the file from the previous commit with this command: git checkout commit_id filename
[11:37] <guest> thesha: you can check out any file from any commit using that method.
[11:37] <pronet> ubunbo: apt-get gnome alsa mixer
[11:38] <ubunbo> pronet:let me try,thank you~
[11:38] <guest> thesha: and next time ask in #git :)
[11:38] <guest> ubunbo: for managing sound stuff I like the program pavucontrol over the built-in sound app.
[11:39] <thesha> guest: but the braces are not there
[11:39] <guest> did you definitely check out from the correct commit id?
[11:40] <guest> didn't accidentally select the one later than the one you wanted?
[11:41] <guest> thesha: recommend following these https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit
[11:41] <guest> thesha: and asking further questions in #git  rather than here.
[11:41] <ubunbo> pronet, This method is invalid
[11:41] <thesha> guest: yes i copied it and paste it ,it executed git checkout commit_id
[11:42] <thesha> :(

[11:45] <CrazyH> sruli, any idea where I can view the soruce code for workspace switcher? I know that the code is available, I just don't know the official name of the workspace switcher program

[11:47] <thesha> guest: thanks for your time
[11:48] <jamesrleimer> hi
[11:51] <CrazyH> sruli, is there a way to use tail -f to monitor the database that dconf writes to / reads from? If so, I could use that to track down some of whats attempting to be done behind the scenes

[12:13] <everson> Hi all, using 16.04 desktop, I have multiple terminals open that are SSHd into different servers. In old versions of Ubuntu I would see window "titles" in the taskbar with the server names, ie: everson@freenode, everson@othernode, etc. - but now I can't, and having to alt-tab is getting a bit frustrating. Any tips on how to get the window titles to display in the taskbar again? Thanks
[12:17] <sruli> everson: are you using regular ubuntu unity? i see user@domain in the title of each tab
[12:18] <everson> sruli, yup. And yeah it's in the tab of the terminal, but in my panel I want to the title of the windows in my workspace - like old school ubuntu / OS interfaces.
[12:19] <wonderworld> everson: maybe try another terminal app like guake
[12:19] <sruli> everson: when u right click on terminal icon what do you get?
[12:21] <everson> sruli, yeah I get the window list. I'm wanting to see the actual title previews in the panel of each open window though - make sense? Just one click away, or better yet I can alt-tab more easily between windows open in my workspace (so multiple terminal windows don't stack).
[12:21] <everson> (Not sure if I'm phrasing all the jargon correctly, apologies if that is the case)
[12:24] <sruli> everson: if i understand correctly, you want 1, not to group icons of same open applications. 2, display text with icon in panel?
[12:25] <everson> sruli, yup! :)
[12:26] <everson> sruli, have a look at this screenshot - the bottom left "andrei@andrei-desktop" - I want one of those "window previews" open for each open window. http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vWw7vXIJHUE/T75bI5piXJI/AAAAAAAAJAk/pUhkW8VhsPc/s1600/ambiance-before-fix-gnome-classic.png

=== mrk is now known as mrkl
[12:46] <everson> Haris, it's possible that it is being overwritten in a local .htaccess file
[12:47] <sruli> Haris: you might also need to change the "upload_max_filesize = 15M"
[12:47] <everson> Haris, otherwise it might be being said at runtime in one of your applications php scripts. Look out for a command: init_set("post_max_size", "8M"); or something along those lines

[14:10] <Arrghus> Not necessarily. I've done it before, I know how it works, but right now I don't see much of a benefit to it. Nor a downside, though.
[14:10] <cfhowlett> wiggmpk, dpkg -l | grep i386
[14:10] <wiggmpk> thanks mate
[14:11] <cfhowlett> happy2help!
[14:11] <wiggmpk> any way to safely remove them without it removing things like "wine-staging, ubuntu-gnome-desktop, etc"?
[14:12] <sruli> Arrghus: make 2 partitions in the ssd, 1 around "256mb ext2 /boot" another with rest of space "ext4 /" "ext4 /home", bootloader should be in the ssd
[14:12] <sruli> Arrghus: you can make a swap partition in the 1tb drive aswell
[14:12] <cfhowlett> wiggmpk, see for yourself with a simulation: apt-get remove -s *i386*
[14:13] <wiggmpk> cfhowlett: simulation? this is new to me lol
[14:13] <cfhowlett> wiggmpk, the "-s" triggers the sim

[14:15] <cfhowlett> wiggmpk, why do you hate 386?
[14:15] <Arrghus> sruli: "" another with rest of space "ext4 /" "ext4 /home" "" is this one or two partitions?
[14:15] <wiggmpk> cfhowlett: I don't, I just have OCD
[14:16] <wiggmpk> cfhowlett: installed a few native linux games that require 32bit libs and I would rather have the libs inside the game directory to keep things tidy
[14:16] <sruli> Arrghus: ext4 = partition type, /, /boot. /home are mount points, you will see them in the dropdown when configuring the partition
[14:16] <cfhowlett> wiggmpk, understood.
[14:16] <wiggmpk> cfhowlett: only because some games require older 32bit libs that I had to manually download to begin with, OCD lol
[14:18] <wiggmpk> cfhowlett: so, I suppose I can't stop apt from removing packages like my nvidia drivers? I just have to reinstall them afterwards?
[14:18] <cfhowlett> wiggmpk,
[14:19] <cfhowlett> so it would seem.  perhaps best to just live with the status quo?
[14:19] <wiggmpk> I wish they wouldn't have gotten rid of the ia32 pacakge
[14:20] <Arrghus> sruli: Ok, so I set up a small space for the bootloader first. Then should I give the rest to root? Or home? Or make two separate partitions in the SSD, one for each? I don't seem to be able to make a partition that mounts at both root and home?
[14:21] <wiggmpk> Arrghus: a single partition that mounts at / would contain /home
[14:21] <wiggmpk> Arrghus: unless you want to separate them, makes for easier disaster recovery IMO
[14:21] <Arrghus> That makes sense.
[14:22] <Arrghus> Then do I want to try and do something with the HDD as well?
[14:23] <Arrghus> The HDD resists me creating a new partition table on it, claiming it is in use by "LVM volume group ubuntu-vg".
[14:25] <wiggmpk> Arrghus: are you using a liveCD or are you booted up like normal?
[14:25] <sruli> Arrghus: if you have backed up your data dlelete all partitions from the drive to be able to add new partitions
[14:25] <sruli> Arrghus: you dont setup space for bootloader, you select where to install bootloader from the dropdown at the bottom of partition page. you then split the ssd into 2 partitions, 1 for boot (256mb should be enough) specify type "ext2", mount point select "/boot". for the second partition, specify type "ext4", mount point "/". then select the 1tb drive from list create a partition 2 times the size of your ram and type "swaparea", the rest of partition type "ext4"

[14:27] <Fayn> What happens to scripts in /etc/init in Ubuntu? does systemd manage services in there, or is it via some other system?
[14:27] <cubic1> Hello guys, I have few active ports (eth0,1,2) and I need to find out if the active port is on the PCI Ethernet card or the port on the On-board Ethernet. Any hints please ? I'm using Red Hat Linux and I do not have physical access to the server.
[14:28] <cfhowlett> cubic1, only 1: ask redhat.
[14:28] <cfhowlett> !redhat more than likely.  not supported here.
[14:28] <ubottu> cfhowlett: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[14:28] <wiggmpk> Fayn: I think you have to make a *.service file nowadays and put it somewhere like /etc/systemd/system/*.service
[14:29] <Pici> cubic1: Their channel is #rhel (or #centos if you're on that)
[14:29] <wiggmpk> Fayn: although I am a complete n00b to systemd
[14:29] <cubic1> thanks Pici
[14:31] <sruli> Arrghus: where i wrote "type" i was referring to "Filesystem type", in partition menu the label where you select it might be "Filesystem"
[14:32] <Arrghus> I can't seem to manipulate the majority of the HDD directly (except for about a gb at the start) but I can rewrite two partitions under something called "/dev/mapper" which I'm prety sure is the LVM. I can't increase or decrease the sizes of these partitions, but they seem to be about the sizes needed for a swap space and a storage space anyway.
[14:33] <wiggmpk> Arrghus: it is part of the LVM yes, you would have to delete the partitions and re-create them to do anything with them
[14:33] <wiggmpk> Arrghus: have you tried using the "guided partitioning" option?
[14:33] <Arrghus> Haven't seen anything under that name.
[14:34] <sruli> Arrghus: can you post a screenshot

[14:34] <wiggmpk> for the pic
[14:36] <Fayn> wiggmpk: i'm pretty sure the service showed in systemd even though it wasn't systemd unit file but a file in /etc/init/. do you think ubuntu uses something like https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-sysv-generator.html?
[14:36] <Fayn> Ubuntu server 16.04
[14:38] <wiggmpk> Fayn: no, you create the unit file and symlink it to /etc/systemd/system/
[14:38] <wiggmpk> then enable the script
[14:39] <wiggmpk> systemctl daemon-reload
[14:39] <wiggmpk> systemctl enable my_systemd_script.service
[14:39] <wiggmpk> systemctl start my_systemd_script.service
[14:39] <wiggmpk> Fayn: keep in mind, I am very new to systemd and that is just what I pulled off the internet
[14:40] <wiggmpk> Fayn: it would be best practice to convert your init script to a unit file for systemd
[14:42] <sruli> Arrghus: have you managed to partition it?
[14:43] <Arrghus> Everything except the HDD looks good. Got caught up in smartphone stuff trying to transfer photos of my screen.
[14:44] <wiggmpk> my bad
[14:45] <Arrghus> My old computer and my smartphone don't get along well.
[14:46] <Arrghus> I think I've located the photos, but I'm not sure and my old computer can't read whatever format they're stored in, so I'm opening up my old Google Drive account to see if that can read them so I can be sure.
[14:47] <sruli> Arrghus: cant u upload them to something like snag.gy from your smartphone?
[14:48] <Arrghus> Probably. Don't know what that is, I barely use my phone for non-phone things.

[15:36] <sruli> Arrghus, the bootloader gets installed on a drive not a partition, you selected the 1tb drive for the bootloader, ideally it should be on the same drive as the boot partition which in your case is /dev/sdb  (bootloader dropdown is at the bottom, "device for bootloader installation" )

[16:18] <aryan_> 3.5.2
[16:18] <FinalX> and what did "which python3" return?
[16:19] <FinalX> it should return /usr/bin/python3
[16:19] <aryan_>  /usr/local/bin/python3
[16:19] <FinalX> you can also check if /usr/lib/python3.5/bz2.py exists .. that's what's installed by the package, libpython3.5-stdlib
[16:20] <FinalX> hum, that's not a ubuntu python3, then
[16:20] <FinalX> system's python3 is installed in /usr/bin/python3
[16:20] <FinalX> dpkg -S /usr/local/bin/python3
[16:20] <aryan_> FinalX, ok how do I change ?
[16:20] <FinalX> (if it doesn't return a package, python3 was manually compiled/installed on the system)
[16:21] <aryan_> to /usr/bin/python3 ?
[16:21] <FinalX> well, first check if someone screwed up your system by installing software without using packages, or whether you're lucky and it's a package that it's coming from, with the dpkg -S command I gave you
[16:22] <FinalX> you can also try and just type the full path to the ubuntu version, /usr/bin/python3 and then "import bz2" should work just fine.
[16:22] <FinalX> if that works you can rename /usr/local/bin/python3 to /usr/local/bin/python3.disabled and if needed, symlink /usr/local/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3 .. or uninstall the package if you're lucky enough to have it coming from a package.
[16:25] <aryan_> FinalX, ok, got that my sis installed it via source code
[16:25] <aryan_> can I uninstall that ??
[16:25] <tonyt> ducasse k
[16:26] <FinalX> aryan_: no, if you don't use a package, it's a pain in the butt to get it all removed. maybe you can just do "mv /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.disabled"
[16:26] <FinalX> then the files will still be there, but your PATH will then probably prefer /usr/bin/python3
[16:26] <FinalX> I'm assuming the system's python3 is still fully functionally installed

[17:08] <waltman> tdannecy_: I don't understand what you're asking. That page lists network installers and torrent sources.
[17:10] <tdannecy_> waltman: You should download a network installer. The network install will hopefully avoid any issues that you have with graphics drivers.
[17:10] <waltman> ok, I'll try that.
[17:11] <waltman> Or could I try the server installer?
[17:13] <jenz> هلاا
[17:14] <tdannecy_> waltman: Not the server installer. That will give you a bunch of packages you probably won't need.
[17:16] <zzero1> how can I have a custom script that I will include in the initramfs executed on initramfs boot ?
[17:18] <pyBlob> I have created a chroot using mk-sbuild, how do I properly remove it?
[17:21] <MonkeyDust> pyBlob  the most common way to remove chroot is with     sudo umount /var/chroot/proc; sudo rm -r /var/chroot

[18:38] <MonkeyDust> trk  which application and what happens when you try
[18:39] <trk> i installed maltego using downloaded package
[18:39] <trk> amd it not show option of uninstall on unity menu
[18:39] <trk> MonkeyDust:
[18:40] <nacc> trk: 'downloaded package'? do you mean a .deb file from a webstie?
[18:40] <nacc> *website
[18:40] <trk> nacc: yest
[18:41] <nacc> trk: how did you install it?
[18:42] <trk> sinply download it and may be installed it using double click then application manager pop up for installation
[18:42] <trk> nacc:
[18:43] <nacc> trk: maybe use the software center to uninstall it then?
[18:44] <trk> nacc: it is not shown under installed section of software center.
[18:45] <OerHeks> any .deb installed with softwarecenter should show up in ; installed;
[18:46] <nacc> trk: you could also run `dpkg -S maltego` I guess (hard to say since I don't know what the eventual package name was)
[18:50] <trk> nacc: it is not unistalled by above command binary name is MaltegoXL
[18:50] <OerHeks> That command just lists packagenames.
[18:50] <nacc> trk: no, it won't uninstall it, but it will show if it is considered installed by dpkg (and what files it installed)
[18:53] <trk> nacc: Output of dpkg -S command is https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/23654909/
[18:54] <guest-useped> hi

[19:22] <CrazyH> Whats up with ubuntu 15.x? I'm trying to upgrade to it, but it's the only release on Ubuntu's site that doesn't have standard .iso files.
[19:23] <nacc> CrazyH: 15.x are all eol
[19:23] <nacc> CrazyH: you should *not* upgrade to it
[19:23] <genii> !eolupgrade
[19:23] <ubottu> End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[19:23] <nacc> it's only still on the archives because of ubuntu phone
[19:25] <CrazyH> wow... that EOL list is surprisingly out of order! Didn't see that commin' O_o
[19:25] <nacc> CrazyH: how is it out of order? it's in reverse chronological order
[19:25] <CrazyH> I mean out of order according to release numbers
[19:26] <\9> CrazyH: 14.04 is LTS, so it has 5 years of support
[19:26] <\9> so is 16.04 (LTS is released every 2 years)
[19:26] <\9> and 16.10 is the latest
[19:26] <tgm4883> I still don't understand, but you need to look at the EOLUpgrades link to get updated
[19:26] <\9> also 12.04 is on its final year of support
[19:26] <\9> so those 4 are still supported
[19:27] <CrazyH> but 12.10 is already EOL
[19:27] <CrazyH> 15 is EOL
[19:27] <\9> right, because 12.10 is not LTS
[19:27] <\9> 12.04 is
[19:27] <nacc> CrazyH: and those are in the EOL section, so again, how is it out of order?
[19:27] <CrazyH> That's what I meant when I said that it was out of order
[19:27] <tgm4883> CrazyH: just because you don't understand the order doesn't mean it's out of order
[19:28] <nacc> CrazyH: maybe you need to revisit the support timelines for Ubuntu releases?
[19:28] <\9> CrazyH: it is in order if you consider LTS and non-LTS releases separately :)
[19:28] <tgm4883> granted, whoever put that page together could have done it better
[19:28] <\9> 10.04 is EOL, 12.04, 14.04 and 16.04 are supported
[19:28] <CrazyH> whatever. It was just an observation based on my opinion with is obviously wrong. It's not worth wasting the bandwidth to talk about it
[19:28] <\9> mm
[19:29] <OerHeks> CrazyH, boot your ubuntu more often :-)
[19:29] <tgm4883> whatever happened to the support graphic?
[19:29] <nacc> tgm4883: the ones here? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack ?
[19:30] <nacc> while specific to the kernel, they are overall accurate, i think
[19:30] <tgm4883> nacc: similiar, but actaually for supported releases
[19:30] <tgm4883> nacc: similiar to the graphic here http://www.mythbuntu.org/  because the graphic I'm talking about is what I designed that after
[19:31] <nacc> tgm4883: interesting, i have no idea :)
[19:31] <OerHeks> tgm4883, on this page , https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life
[19:32] <CrazyH> Does anyone know how to solve this issue that I posted on Ubuntu forums? https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2346852  I've been trying to solve it for about 24 hours now. If I can get this solved then I can upgrade to 16.04. Otherwise I'll have to go with 14.04.5 LTS
[19:32] <tgm4883> OerHeks: oh yea, that's an updated one. Pretty
[19:33] <OerHeks> CrazyH, that " Dconf setting to move the close, maximize and minimize buttons to the right side of the window" does not work in 16.04 anyway
[19:35] <CrazyH> DerHeks. Yes it does. I know because I'm using it
[19:35] <OerHeks> So you are on 12.04, Gnome flashback?
[19:37] <OerHeks> That whole story starts with 16.04, but you ended with help to upgrade 12.304.
[19:37] <CrazyH> OerHeks, Right now I'm am running 12.x with Gnome flash back. I also have a seperate install of 16.04 running Gnome flash back
[19:37] <CrazyH> 16.04 is what I want to upgrade to, but I can't do that unless I get workspaces working
[19:40] <CrazyH> OerHeks, I deleted the last line of that post because its irrelevant. What I need it help fixing 16.04
[19:40] <CrazyH> *is
[19:44] <CrazyH> Well, I guess I'll go with 14.04.5 LTS and hopes it works out better than 16.04

[19:57] <corba> wafflejock, i should, the destination is my local disk, im going to try with sudo
[19:58] <MWM> corba: Im out then.  Ive never accessed windows from xubuntu.  Other way around works fine.  If it helps NTFS cant hold Linux permissions so that may help you find the issue
[19:58] <wafflejock> corba, well depends on where on the local disk you're trying to save, if it's your home folder should be fine
[19:58] <corba> MWM, i tried with NTFS and ext4

[19:59] <MWM> oh wait... heard you wrong.  You are booted to xubuntu and are trying to get to windows right? how did you set up samba?
[19:59] <corba> wafflejock, nope, its a separate disk
[19:59] <corba> wafflejock, ill look into that thanks
[19:59] <MWM> did you write your share into /etc/samba/smb.conf?

[20:14] <groob> I'm dual booting 2 ubuntu systems (both are 16.04).  Call them OS1 and OS2.  Currently grub is installed from OS1, so update-grub only has an effect when run from OS1.  What is the best way to get the bootloader to automatically update if OS2 has a kernel update?
[20:14] <jamesrleimer> hi
[20:15] <corba> groob, I guess the easiest way is to instal grub customizer in os2, and when you update the kernel, also update grub from grub-customizer

[20:18] <corba> nope, and i dont know if it will correctly update the grub because the past update was in /boot from OS1

[20:20] <groob> corba: Ah ok.  Yea, that's the issue that I'm hitting.  Each OS has a seperate /boot that is updated.  I suspect that the solution would require OS2 to change the /boot location to be the same as OS1.
[20:20] <corba> groob, you could put /boot on a separate partition :)

[20:26] <janat08> how do i access windows partition?
[20:26] <corba> janat08, you mount it
[20:28] <groob> corba: Thanks for the help!  I'll try using a dedicated boot partition instead.  The biggest downside that I can think of is that the partition order in the menu will change depending on which OS ran update-grub last.  If that could be solved, then it would be perfect.
[20:28] <corba> partition order?

[20:29] <groob> corba: Err, I mean the order of the operating systems.  OS1 appears first currently, but if OS2 ran update-grub, it would cause OS2 to be listed first.
[20:29] <corba> groob, you could change that with grub-customizer easily
[20:30] <groob> corba: Oh, cool.  Good to know!  Thanks!
[20:30] <corba> you need to install it through the ppa though

[20:42] <OerHeks> walidof, ubuntu core setup needs a SSO account, https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=101141 so you get SSH key to login
[20:42] <groob> Bashing-om: Ah, I see.  Currently I just have 2 /boot directories, so nothing conflicts.  When OS2 has a kernel update, it just updates a /boot that is never used.  If I set up a decidated boot partition, I'll take note of that.  Thanks
[20:42] <OerHeks> err https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/start/raspberry-pi-2/
[20:44] <groob> zacky83: I'm not really sure then.  When I installed it (using the guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fail2ban ), I had to "cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local" before it worked.  If you don't have that directory, however, then I'm not sure what to do.
[20:44] <devn0ll> What do you guys recommend for copying/cloning a directory? (eg cloning /storage1 to /storage2 locally) -- Its about 3TB data, both large single files and very small ones. Preferably with progressbar and some sort of verifying the integrity of the files after the copy.
[20:44] <corba> i think i fixed the samba problem, i install fuse, sambaclient, and run through cli "thunar smb://'ip_destination'"
[20:45] <Ben64> devn0ll: rsync
[20:45] <OerHeks> rsync with grsync as gui
[20:46] <walidof> i use SSH correct, but efter put email and login, the next need  localhost login name / pass, in general in ubuntu for pc is normal add root / toor or ubuntu/ubuntu to login but in core i try all what i know but not work
[20:47] <zacky83> groob sorry ,I have this directory , I have jail.conf in it but not jail.local
[20:47] <OerHeks> try ubuntu:<empty>
[20:48] <walidof> i try
[20:48] <walidof> ubuntu:<empty> / root:<empty> / toor:<empty> / startx:<empty>
[20:48] <Bachus> is xubuntu supported here
[20:49] <Ben64> Bachus: yes
[20:49] <Ben64> walidof: well it's not going to be toor or startx for sure
[20:49] <groob> zacky83: Ah, ok good!  The first thing that I always do is copy the jail.conf to jail.local.  Then add all of the necessary configuration changes to jail.local.
[20:50] <zacky83> groob , how can /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/asterisk.conf be taken in account for fail2ban ?
[20:50] <walidof> Ben64: what is the solution ? how can login ? and this is first use ubuntu core to raspberry pi
=== deanman is now known as deanman_
[20:52] <Ben64> walidof: idk, but it certainly isn't toor or startx
[20:52] <Bachus> til what year are security updates provided to the users of xubuntu 16.04
[20:53] <OerHeks> not sure there is a password, the guide clearly states ssh key https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/start/raspberry-pi-2/
[20:53] <ppf> !lts
[20:53] <ubottu> LTS means Long Term Support. Until 12.04 LTS versions of Ubuntu were supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; since 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) LTS versions will be supported for 5 years on the desktop and server. The latest LTS version of Ubuntu is !Xenial (Xenial Xerus 16.04.1)
[20:53] <corba> can you use rsync with a windows machine?
[20:53] <Ben64> sure
[20:53] <ppf> corba: via samba
[20:53] <corba> thx :)
[20:55] <groob> zacky83: That I'm not sure about unfortunately.  Perhaps someone else knows?  I've never used that fail2ban filter.
[20:55] <Bachus> ppf: is xubuntu 16.04.1 supported for three years like 16.04?
[20:55] <Ben64> Bachus: you didn't seem to read what ubottu said
[20:56] <Bachus> Ben64: oh yea
[20:57] <Bachus> i apologize for my stupidity, Ben64, i can assure you that not all beginners are like me
[20:57] <Ben64> Bachus: no worries
[20:58] <OerHeks> just hop from lts to lts any 2 years :-)

[21:18] <MOUD> Hey all
[21:21] <ghoul> hi
[21:21] <worktoner> Did the 'top' program get replaced from ubuntu 10 to 14?
[21:22] <MOUD> I'm looking for a few programs. I need a program like Netbalaner (which tells each program how much bandwidth it's using and the ability to block traffic for that specific program). The other program is one that shows every page that I visit but with the full url.
[21:23] <nacc> worktoner: no, top still exists
[21:23] <nacc> MOUD: isn't the latter just your browser history?
[21:23] <MonkeyDust> was thinking the same thing
[21:23] <worktoner> nacc: No i mean, is it a different program for that functionality
[21:24] <worktoner> It seems very different from how it used to be
[21:24] <nacc> worktoner: are you sure you're not running htop instead of top perhaps?
[21:24] <ppf> worktoner: there is htop, which is a bit more colorful
[21:24] <MOUD> nacc, no. Some pages (usually php ones) don't show the full url when you go to another link.
[21:24] <MOUD> also, some images are the same too.
[21:24] <Elementalist> dafuq
[21:24] <Elementalist> i cant see the users list
[21:24] <Elementalist> wtf
[21:24] <worktoner> I used to know how to navigate around and change the column priorities, etc.. now I'm nearly useless with top..
[21:25] <MonkeyDust> Elementalist  mind your language
[21:25] <Elementalist> sorry m8
[21:25] <Elementalist> apparently i am using wrong program
[21:25] <Elementalist> is there any program near mIrc?
[21:25] <MonkeyDust> Elementalist  try hexchat
[21:25] <Elementalist> i mean looks-operates
[21:26] <ppf> xchat
[21:26] <MOUD> Elementalist, I use HexChat
[21:26] <ppf> or whatever that's called today
[21:26] <potatolord> Weechat
[21:26] <Elementalist> hexchat ok
[21:26] <ppf> yeah, hexchat :)
[21:26] <nacc> worktoner: run top and then hit '?' to get the help
[21:26] <Elementalist> i am currently using xchat and i cant see the users
[21:26] <nacc> worktoner: it's certainly possibly (although sort of unlikely) that the options have changed between major releases
[21:26] <Elementalist> i am just seeing only those who speak/leave/join.
[21:27] <Elementalist> oh dear...
[21:27] <Elementalist> what a tab can do in that program...
[21:27] <Elementalist> sorry
[21:27] <worktoner> Ahh I see they've changed around the commands.
=== jcdenton is now known as Repentance
[21:27] <Elementalist> brb
[21:28] <bray90820> What would be a good way to slow down the mouse pointer speed from the terminal
[21:28] <pavlos> Elementalist, you can right click on the channel, settings, hide those who join/leave
[21:29] <MOUD> that reminds me... how can I use CTRL+C/V on terminal?
[21:29] <MonkeyDust> MOUD  ctrl ins pasts
[21:29] <nacc> MOUD: it depends on your terminal application, in gnome-terminal, e.g. it's ctrl+shift+c/v
[21:30] <MOUD> -.-
[21:30] <MonkeyDust> MOUD  i mean, shift-ins
[21:30] <MOUD> can't I change it? or another terminal alternative?
[21:31] <froglok> can anyone help me fixing an issue? Using amazon EC2 for a virtual ubuntu server.. changed my hosts file to point to the server IP.. setup virtualhosts, apache, etc.. and configured and accessing the domain gives me 403 Forbidden
[21:32] <figure002> hello.
[21:33] <nacc> froglok: anything in your server's logs?
[21:33] <figure002> I'm trying to install collectd on a Ubuntu server, but for some reason it lists a bunch of GTK libs as dependencies (e.g. libgtk-3-0). Is `collectd` the right package?
[21:33] <nacc> froglok: and did you restart apache after all your configuration changes?
[21:33] <nacc> figure002: are you installing all the 'recommends'?
[21:34] <nacc> figure002: which version of ubuntu?
[21:34] <Elementalist> pavlos here?
[21:34] <froglok> yes I restarted. I followed the instructions to setup a virtualhost. did the a2ensite command, etc.. it definitely did something because previously it showed the default index.html Apache page.. once that was done it showed the 403 forbidden error
[21:34] <pavlos> figure002, there is collectd and collectd-utils
[21:34] <figure002> nacc: Ubuntu 16.04. No, just the required packages.
[21:34] <froglok> I havent checked logs
[21:34] <pavlos> Elementalist, here
[21:34] <Elementalist> ela re patrida
[21:34] <pavlos> geia mas
[21:34] <Elementalist> ti programma xrhsimopoieis?
[21:34] <nacc> figure002: can you pastebin the command and output you are using/get?
[21:35] <froglok> I installed apache2.. what other packages could I be missing?
[21:35] <wedgie> froglok: that depends a lot on your site...
[21:35] <nacc> froglok: i would check the logs then?
[21:36] <froglok> ok Ill see what the logs say
[21:36] <wedgie> froglok: check /var/log/apache2 for logs. If nothing stands out there then pastebin your vhosts config
[21:36] <figure002> nacc: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23655644/
[21:36] <froglok> cool thanks for being helpful, awesome chatroom lol
[21:37] <nacc> figure002: are you fully up to date *before* installing collectd? (`apt update; apt full-upgrade`)
[21:38] <figure002> nacc: you mean `dist-upgrade`? yes, my system is fully up-to-date.
[21:38] <nacc> figure002: well, `apt` and `apt-get` have different options, but sure
[21:38] <nacc> figure002: ok, i think it's because librrd pulls in a bunch of stuff
[21:39] <nacc> figure002: you could try 'collectd-core', but not sure if it will get you everyting you want
[21:39] <froglok> it looks like this is the error: [Mon Dec 19 20:32:47.199290 2016] [authz_core:error] [pid 3963]  AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /home/user/example.com$
[21:40] <figure002> nacc: yeah, I just checked that packages, but it seems like I will miss some stuff (e.g. configurations)
[21:41] <hahuang61> hey guys, I just installed 16.10 and something I noticed with the LiveCD and after install (as well as Fedora 25 LiveCD) is that my mouse cursor won't move, but the underlying mouse moves (I can move and make a guess where the cursor is and click, but the actual cursor displayed never moves)
[21:41] <ph88^> hey guys, i'm using ubuntu 16.04 and i added this repo to software https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo/  why am i getting  Could not resolve host: apt.dockerproject.org  during apt update  ??
[21:41] <hahuang61> anyone run into this issue before?
[21:41] <nacc> ph88^: are you able to resolve it?
[21:42] <ph88^> what do you mean resolve it ?
[21:42] <figure002> I guess I could just pull the configuration from somewhere, thanks for checking nacc
[21:42] <nacc> ph88^: `nslookup apt.dockerproject.org` or `dig apt.dockerproject.org`
[21:42] <pavlos> it pings
[21:42] <nacc> figure002: np
[21:42] <nacc> pavlos: well, ping for you isn't helping ph88^ :)
[21:43] <pavlos> nacc, sorry
[21:43] <froglok> sweet I got it working now
[21:43] <ph88^> nacc, nslookupp returns the ip adres ... by the way if i put it in my browser i see something as well
[21:43] <nacc> ph88^: pastebin full output?
[21:44] <sysconfig> hi
[21:44] <ph88^> nacc, http://pastebin.com/1y0ULkBi
[21:44] <nacc> ph88^: sorry, pastebin output from `apt update`
[21:45] <ph88^> eh now it's not giving that error anymore o_O
[21:52] <figure002> nacc: this is so weird.. check this out: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23655695/
[21:52] <sysconfig> what is weird
[21:52] <figure002> apparently Ubuntu installs recommended packages by default?
[21:52] <nicomachus> yes
[21:52] <sysconfig> apparnetly,..
[21:52] <figure002> sysconfig: see my previous posts
[21:52] <sysconfig> about what
[21:53] <figure002> sysconfig: scroll up a little, it's right there
[21:55] <zh19970205> ehh ...
[21:55] <zh19970205> it is the first time I use irc lol...
[21:55] <zh19970205> so .. anybody can tell me why I can not use /help now ...
[21:56] <OerHeks> collectD : Note: The package does not depend on all packages that are required by all of the plugins ... so if you want all the plugins to work, you need them.
[21:56] <sysconfig> no, nobody's goin to tell ya anything like that
[21:57] <zacky83> Hi, I have a problem with fail2ban , it does not put the IP in jail

[21:57] <Mccallum1983> can anyone assist, when i try to install bitcoin from git on 14.04 i get autoreconf: aclocal failed with exit status: 1, is this an error with my system or with the dev
[21:57] <figure002> OerHeks: still makes no sense to me why a daemon would need X11 and such..
[21:58] <figure002> zacky83: did you enable the jails?
[21:59] <Mccallum1983> can anyone help
