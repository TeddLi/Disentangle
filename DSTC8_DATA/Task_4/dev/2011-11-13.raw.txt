[21:30] <dcherniv> Zeelot, not really. but you can get preinstalled laptops from vendors such as system76.com
[21:30] <elgaton> peque_: Yes, correct.
[21:30] <pfifo> haunt_house, you probably need to install blender properly instead of keeping it in a folder
[21:30] <monsemannen> @guntbert: should I just change them to oneiric?
[21:30] <peque_> elgaton: ok, then, thanks <strong>a lot</strong> for your help :-D
[21:30] <Zeelot> dcherniv: thanks, any others?
[21:30] <haunt_house> pfifo, cant, since ubuntu wont let me without constantly upgrading and breaking things
[21:30] <pfifo> !alot
[21:30] <ubottu> Do you like to hug alot? - http://bit.ly/aVDMTo
[21:30] <guntbert> monsemannen: wait a moment, I want to read it
[21:31] <peque_> elgaton: I'll continue with this tomorrow or on monday (I'll try first if I can fix the Firewall issue)
[21:31] <elgaton> peque_: If you want to use GMail's servers as relays, look at <http://bookmarks.honewatson.com/2008/04/20/postfix-gmail-smtp-relay/>
[21:31] <haunt_house> pfifo, latest install version is 2.49, but I run 2.6
[21:31] <Tixos>  can someone tell me if i can use 11.4 Catalyst (ATI) drivers on 11.10 please
[21:31] <elgaton> peque_: OK
[21:31] <Mneumonic> What is the current status of reading and writing to an NTFS partition on Linux?  I haven't tried in a long time but I would like to change my external Hard drive to Fat
[21:31] <pfifo> haunt_house, install it into /usr/local
[21:31] <Mneumonic> from fat*
[21:31] <dcherniv> Zeelot, you can google for ubuntu vendors, there's some others yes. i bought mine from system76 so i can speak for the rest
[21:31] <Zeelot> dcherniv: and how is it?
[21:32] <Zeelot> as far as hardware quality?
[21:32] <haubuntu> elgaton, still not working
[21:32] <ben_> I've added some settings to Apache's httpd.conf file, restarted apache, but the settings aren't taking effect. Any idea why?
[21:33] <dcherniv> Zeelot, mine was noname, nobrand. All hardware was opensource supported though. Lasted me for about two years until i dropped it :)
[21:33] <elgaton> ben_: Have you run sudo apache2ctl configcheck?
[21:34] <Pumpkin->  /win 45
[21:34] <Pumpkin-> ssgdsgd
[21:34] <guntbert> monsemannen: you should delete line 11  and replace every other ocurrence of lucid with natty. -- How did you upgrade?
[21:34] <elgaton> haubuntu: try this command: sudo ufw logging on
[21:34] <Advocated> Hi there, quick query, for some reason ive lost my minimize/max/close buttons from firefox, terminal has also lost its toolbar and status bar, other apps behaving the same. Any ideas ? 10.04..
[21:34] <idefix> icons and smileys are not displayed in my Evolution Mail, what could be the problem?
[21:35] <dcherniv> Zeelot, that was quite some time ago though. 4 years back.
[21:35] <monsemannen> @guntbert: okay! Thanks. I ran 'apt-get dist-upgrade'. Why natty instead of oneiric?
[21:35] <pretorian_> hi
[21:36] <idefix> are there no upgrades for evolution mail?
[21:36] <hololight> Is there a way to setup xrdp so that I am logging into the current session rather than starting a new session? I have already read the man pages and there isn't any mention of this.
[21:36] <haubuntu> elgaton, still no entries in it
[21:36] <Zeelot> dcherniv: many thanks
[21:36] <guntbert> monsemannen: ouch! thx for asking back - "replace every other ocurrence of lucid with oneiric"  of course, as to the upgrade process, please ask ubottu about it with /msg ubottu upgrade
[21:37] <iceroot> hololight: no, for that you need "vlc" never heard that rdp can do something like that
[21:37] <elgaton> haubuntu: try this: sudo ufw logging medium
[21:37] <elgaton> haubuntu: or sudo ufw logging full (note: this will log ALL packets, beware the log size)
[21:38] <elgaton> haubuntu: The last command is just meant for quick checks
[21:38] <dcherniv> iceroot, hololight vnc rather
[21:38] <hololight> Well, in linux I am starting to think that. Windows will allow you to do this; vlc is  fine, but will not work in my use case
[21:38] <elgaton> haubuntu: Also, have you rsyslog installed?
[21:38] <guntbert> monsemannen: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MaverickUpgrades#Network_Upgrade_for_Ubuntu_Servers_.28Recommended.29  (that is still valid)
[21:38] <haubuntu> elgaton, logging is enabled..i remove the ufw.log and rentered the commands you suggested
[21:38] <elgaton> haubuntu: OK
[21:38] <ben_> elgaton: Running apache2ctl doesn't seem to work. I've run apache2 -t to check syntax. It igves me "bad user name ${APACHE_RUN_USER}"
[21:38] <iceroot> hololight: dcherniv of course vnc and not vlc...
[21:39] <hololight> didn't even notice the spelling error, I read it as vnc
[21:39] <monsemannen> @guntbert: will do! Thanks for helping. Much appreciated :>
[21:39] <nimbiotics> Looks like compiz is not working (v11.10-unity). What to do?
[21:39] <guntbert> monsemannen: no problem :)  .. and Good luck :-)
[21:39] <hololight> The problem with vnc is poor use of bandwidth... I hate having to use rdp (a ms tech), but I need the better performance
[21:40] <milen8204> Hello all I have one problem, I am whit gnome classic on Ubuntu 11.10, and now I have chosen an option wobbly windows in copmpiz manager but my windows are not wobbled, the same is whit Zoom option what can be wrong ?
[21:40] <monsemannen> @guntbert: thanks!:)

[21:40] <elgaton> ben_: Is /etc/apache2/envvars present? If so, could you please paste it in a pastebin?
[21:40] <|Anthony|> need to mount a ntfs partition to share storage space between win7 and ubuntu. Working on fstab...
[21:40] <|Anthony|> does the  "mount point" column need to be a path? or can i just say "storage"
[21:40] <nimbiotics> milen8204: ditto
[21:40] <elgaton> |Anthony|: yes, it needs to be an existing directory
[21:41] <Advocated> for some reason ive lost my minimize/max/close buttons from firefox, terminal has also lost its toolbar and status bar, other apps behaving the same. Any ideas ? 10.04..
[21:41] <iceroot> |Anthony|: a directory, you can use a full path /home/foo/storage or storage when you are inside /home/foo/
[21:41] <milen8204> nimbiotics,  ditto ???
[21:41] <Guest8043> <advocated>, restore window decoration settings from compiz manager (system settings)
[21:41] <Mneumonic> Advocated were you disabling or enabling effects?
[21:41] <Mneumonic> Advocated I've had that happen and it just needed a restart of my computer to fix it
[21:41] <nimbiotics> i meant  i have same situation as you do (and a dozen+ more)
[21:42] <Guest8043> no i had the same problem, it's cause window decoration is disabled in compiz
[21:42] <mr_daniel> Are the repository servers down? I am trying to execute 'sudo aptitude update', but I am only getting strange errors, e.g. bzip2 (stdin) is not a bzip2 file etc.
[21:42] <|Anthony|> compiz is buggy from ubuntu repos
[21:42] <mr_daniel> This is the complete output, very strange: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=6VWbnFYQ
[21:43] <Tech-1> I have almost everything running after i did this http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-tiphow-to-removeinstall-and-reconfigure-xorg-without-reinstalling-ubuntu.html
[21:43] <peque_> elgaton: Good bye and thanks again for your help! :-) Hope I can solve the rest by my own ;-)
[21:43] <Tech-1> none of my launchers work
[21:43] <Tech-1> whats missing ?
[21:43] <Advocated> Guest8043, how do you actually restore in compiz then?
[21:43] <elgaton> peque_: You're welcome :)
[21:43] <haubuntu> elgaton, aftera reboot it works thanks for your help
[21:43] <Advocated> Mneumonic, not messed with it atall :S and i rebooted , but still stuck
[21:43] <Guest8043> go to system settings
[21:43] <Guest8043> then type compiz in search box
[21:44] <elgaton> haubuntu: You're welcome
[21:44] <milen8204> nimbiotics, what is ditto
[21:44] <Guest8043> open compiz settings
[21:44] <Guest8043> wait i will find exact menu names
[21:45] <ben_> elgaton: Thanks. http://pastebin.com/WM5xWdXn
[21:45] <Guest8043> you're on oneiric?
[21:45] <pfifo> mr_daniel, considering all the errors are refering to a file thatr is 151 bytes, It looks like your getting a 404 or 500 error, so yes, it seems that server is down or misconfigured
[21:45] <Advocated> Guest8043, thanks, and oneiric? that to me? never heard of it
[21:45] <Guest8043> i mean what version of ubuntu are u running
[21:46] <Advocated> Guest8043, 10.04
[21:46] <Guest8043> ok, i fixed the problem in 11.04. can you launch system settings?
[21:46] <Advocated> yeah
[21:46] <elgaton> ben_: Could you paste the contents of all the files in /etc/apache2 as well (including those in subdirectories)?
[21:47] <Guest8043> is any entry found when searching for compiz?
[21:47] <Guest8043> bc i now search my 11.10 settings and its not found, but it definitely was there before upgrade
[21:47] <Advocated> well ive got compizconfig settings open
[21:47] <Guest8043> yes
[21:47] <Guest8043> great, then find window decoration setting there
[21:47] <Guest8043> turn it on
[21:47] <mr_daniel> pfifo: I hope that this is not the case
[21:48] <Advocated> Guest8043, its already ticked(on)
[21:48] <pfifo> mr_daniel, change to a different mirror
[21:48] <guntbert> mr_daniel: if I read it correctly the server responds, but I have no idea what might be the matter - sorry
[21:48] <realHans> hi. I'm a linux noob. There is a SSD in my computer but I don't know its name (/DEV/??? - for Firmware update)  how do I figure it out ?
[21:48] <Guest8043> was it on or did you turn it on on this session?
[21:48] <ben_> elgaton: That's a lot of stuff. I haven't changed anything from installation other than adding a ServerName and ServerAdmin directive in the httpd.conf file.
[21:48] <Advocated> Guest8043, i dont think ive ever touched it
[21:49] <Guest8043> ok so thats not its fault
[21:49] <Guest8043> was anything you changed in compiz settings? that's too easy to break
[21:49] <Guest8043> i've made my own mistakes there ;D
[21:49] <guntbert> mr_daniel: ah, I missed the 161 bytes, listen to pfifo ...
[21:49] <elgaton> realHans: open a terminal and use the command "dmesg|grep sd", the device name (e.g. sdb) should be shown next to the disk size.
[21:50] <Advocated> not touched it for ages, but possibly, i dont remember doing something and then having a problem
[21:50] <realHans> elgaton: ah, thanks. I'll try ...
[21:50] <elgaton> ben_: I know - just paste it so that I can have a look
[21:50] <Guest8043> ok. so terminal sticks to the top of the screen right? and you're not able to move it
[21:50] <eee> i just installed 11.10 on my eeepc 1000h and it just randomly dumps me to console and locks up.  can't copy text or use/switch to any of the terminals.  i went through dmesg but i dont see any of the errors.  the last error is switching to console but i dont find anything using grep in dmesg
[21:51] <guntbert> ben_: please use a pastebin :)
[21:51] <Advocated> Guest8043, i can move it, but theres no bar(top and bottom) i see the file menus etc, and in firefox the max,min close buttons are missing(and in other apps too)
[21:52] <realHans> elgaton: sda, b and c ....  thank you.
[21:53] <elgaton> realHans: Just make sure you're choosing the right one, use the partition sizes as a guide
[21:53] <eee> is there something i can do to find the issue.  anyone know what the first entry for dmesg would be so I can grep and work bacck from that?
[21:53] <Guest8043> try this

[21:54] <nyuszika7h> Hi, I have a little problem with virtual TTYs.
[21:54] <swharper> this is the current RAID partition table
[21:54] <swharper> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3136063/ubuntuinstall.jpg
[21:54] <Guest8043> you can do that for compiz too, if you ever want to restore compiz
[21:55] <Guest8043> compiz --replace
[21:55] <elgaton> realHans: Just to be precise (double measurement unit)
[21:55] <swharper> when i try to install using this, it hangs at boot
[21:55] <nimbiotics> hello, I'm using ubuntu 11.10 with gnome. I installed compiz, but it doesnt seem to be working as none of the effects do. What can I do?
[21:55] <nyuszika7h> They have a lower resolution than X11, and with VirtualBox Guest Additions, the display is totally screwed up when switching to a TTY.
[21:55] <Guest8043> and if window bars still missing, then go back to metacity --replace :D
[21:55] <Guest8043> glhf
[21:55] <nyuszika7h> Should I use KMS or something?
[21:55] <dagon> nimbiotics, Do you have advanced visuals activated? I know it's a hassle with the new version of Ubuntu
[21:56] <linelevel> Hi guys. I have both Windows and Ubuntu installed on my laptop. Under Windows, the internet works fine on my home network. Under Ubuntu, it disconnects often, though other, stronger connections still work fine. My question is: Is a wireless amplifier likely to help?
[21:56] <linelevel> Also, earlier someone responded "Go into your router and turn the channels down." ...Can someone clarify that?
[21:56] <personal> ola
[21:56] <personal> hello
[21:56] <flopex> linelevel: yes, or you could try changin your router to a different channel and see if that works
[21:56] <kaddi> is there a time line when libmsn will get updated to handle the new msn standards?
[21:57] <dagon> linelevel, where is your router located? Same house or down the street
[21:57] <LSymonds> @linelevel - That would be me. If you can't locate the actual router turn the channels down to a lower number.
[21:57] <R3db3ard> linelevel: from what i've read it has to do with the strength of the broacast channel with lower levels having stronger signal strength.
[21:57] <nimbiotics> dagon: guess not, but i have no idea where is it that I can activate it
[21:57] <opsii> i changed the size of some volumes without changing the size of the partition u.U whats the safest path to follow now?
=== Mud is now known as Guest39791
[21:58] <BluesKaj> linelevel, actaually there may be a lot of local traffic on the desault channels ...I use higher channel like 9 which has fewer dropouts
[21:58] <pfifo> opsii, the safest path to do what?
[21:59] <flopex> linelevel: go into your router settings and under wireless settings there should be an option to change the channel in which your wifi is being brodcast
[21:59] <linelevel> BluesKaj: I'm currently using Channel 9. I've tried others, same problem.
[21:59] <BluesKaj> desault=default
[21:59] <LSymonds> Have you gone down any channels?
[21:59] <linelevel> flopex: Yes, I get that. What I don't get is why using a lower channel will help me get a better signal.
[22:00] <linelevel> LSymonds: I haven't gone down below 7 because my router firmware (Tomato) tells me that those have a worse signal:noise ratio.
[22:00] <ben_> elgaton: There are about 100 files inthere.
[22:00] <elgaton> ben_: 100? OK, the ones in /etc/apache2 (excluding subdirectories) should be enough.
[22:01] <elcam> ciao
[22:01] <LSymonds> linelevel: It can't harm to try it, can it? :)
[22:01] <elcam> !list
[22:01] <ubottu> This is not a file sharing channel (or network); be sure to read the channel topic. If you're looking for information about me, type « /msg ubottu !bot ». If you're looking for a channel, see « /msg ubottu !alis ».
[22:01] <haso> Is http://www.getdeb.net/ a safe source for package installation ?
[22:02] <pfifo> haso, thats not recommended
[22:02] <BluesKaj> linelevel, there should be a broadcast power setting  on the router , which is actually a sensititvity increase setting
[22:02] <haso> pfifo: and reason is ?
[22:03] <linelevel> LSymonds: I'll give it a shot.
[22:03] <pfifo> haso, they are not the official repo's
[22:03] <realHans> Hi.I'm still a noob. I try to execute the program 'fwupd' (-rwxr-xr-x 1 wolfi 73490 2011-08-31 23:53 fwupd) /which is green) but typing './fwupd' i get the message : 'bash: ./fwupd: No such file or directory'. Why ?
[22:03] <linelevel> BluesKaj: Hmm, I've never come across that setting. I thought the broadcast power was fixed. I'm running Tomato firmware on a Linksys WRT-54G (1st generation)
[22:04] <pfifo> realHans, pastebin the output of `ldd ./fwupd`
[22:04] <realHans> ok
[22:04] <x_> hello everyone. i have a laptop that seems to be stuck in sleep, or hibernation. the screen stays blank :/
[22:05] <haso> pfifo: I know that... some other reason ?
[22:05] <Rayston> Is there somewhere I can look at a demo of the Unity Desktop without actually installing it? I am still on 11.04 and want to see what all the fuss is about before upgrading
[22:05] <realHans> pfifo: bash: ./fwupd: No such file or directory
[22:05] <BluesKaj> linelevel, ok , not familiar with that router
[22:05] <realHans> pfifo: 	not a dynamic executable
[22:05] <pfifo> haso, you could end up downloading and installing something that breaks your system
[22:05] <R3db3ard> what's the file i need to edit to change the timer for the GRUB?
[22:05] <jrib> Rayston: live cd or virtual machine
[22:05] <realHans> It seems it is not an executable ...
[22:06] <Rayston> ahh, yes, ill do a virtual machine, good idea
[22:06] <jrib> Rayston: but wait... unity was already in 11.04...
[22:06] <DJones> Rayston: http://www.ubuntu.com/tour/ Should give you an idea of what its like
[22:06] <pfifo> realHans, can you pastebin the output of 'cat fwupd'
[22:06] <idefix> how do you know whether you need 32-bit or 4-bit software?
[22:06] <idefix> 64-bit *
[22:06] <Rayston> it was optional though  in 11.04 and I did not take the option, guess I could turn it on now, dont wanna
[22:06] <SinusPi> 4-bit controllers are cool.
[22:07] <idefix> so the bit is the controller value?
[22:07] <realHans> pfifo: no - it looks binary with a some text ... hmmm ...
[22:07] <haso> pfifo: that I also understand. I can handle that.
[22:07] <jrib> idefix: uname -m   will tell you whether your kernel is 32bit or 64bit
[22:07] <pfifo> idefix, you need to get software that matches your OS
[22:07] <SinusPi> idefix: if you can, run 64. if not, stick with 32. Simple.
[22:07] <realHans> pfifo: thank you for your help
[22:07] <idefix> but it says i686, is that 64- or 32-bit?
[22:07] <dagon> nimbiotics, this might help you out a little getting your compiz to work proper not sloper
[22:07] <SinusPi> idefix: note that there aren't 64-bit ports of some software, so going 64 might leave you with a problem.
[22:07] <jrib> SinusPi: like what?
[22:07] <dagon> nimbiotics, http://www.howtoforge.com/enabling-compiz-fusion-on-an-ubuntu-classic-11.04-desktop-gnome-nvidia-geforce-8200
[22:08] <pfifo> realHans, I dont think that file is an executable file
[22:08] <R3db3ard> what's the file i need to edit to change the timer for the GRUB?
[22:08] <jrib> idefix: that's 32bit
[22:08] <x_> i have a laptop that seems to be stuck in sleep, or hibernation. the screen stays blank, but computer is running.  running 10.04 32bit, if anyone has any thoughts on how to fix, thank you in advance
[22:08] <SinusPi> x_: hold power button? :P
[22:08] <pfifo> realHans, I think that file IS the firmware, you need another program to flash it to your drive
[22:09] <ben_> elgaton: http://pastebin.com/4rHV1bCR
[22:09] <realHans> pfifo: seems so ... I'll try to find the right one. Thank you again. This is for you (and algaton:)  http://dingosbreakfast.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/two-beers1.jpg
[22:09] <rockstar09> hello
[22:09] <x_> (SinusPi) holding power button for ten seconds powers it down. and will turn back on as well, but blank screen. it will flicker occasionally (when trying random alt-f key combinations
[22:09] <iExist> domo
[22:09] <nimbiotics> dagon: thx, will check
[22:10] <dagon> nimbiotics, no problem I hope it helps
[22:10] <realHans> pfifo: you're probably right ... <search-mode-on>
[22:10] <SinusPi> x_: turning it completely off should have it do a full startup sequence on power-on, doesn't it do that?
[22:10] <Rayston> jrib : doh, im an idiot, 10.10 is what I am on, not 11.04,
[22:10] <haso> pfifo: my q is more like: Does http://www.getdeb.net/ have a good reputation for it packaging job?
[22:10] <ben_> 11.10 runs really bad on this Virtual Box machine... Oh...
[22:11] <x_> (SinusPi) nope.. this all started earlier. hibernate has always worked fine on it. went in and enabled sleep under power management, and now.... blank screen
[22:11] <pfifo> haso, that i cant answer, i dont install software from untrusted sources. Tell me, why are you even considering downloading software from them?
[22:11] <Gergov> any way to install ubuntu 10.10 with wubi?
[22:12] <realHans> How do I figure out my ubuntu is 32 or 64 bit ?
[22:12] <elgaton> ben_: OK, just replace ${APACHE_RUN_USER} with www-data in the apache2.conf file
[22:12] <pfifo> realHans, uname -a
[22:12] <realHans> thanks .. 64 ...
[22:13] <Roasted> I like how sometimes when resuming from sleep ubuntu forgets to ask for my pw
[22:13] <R3db3ard> which file in /boot/grub do i edit to change the grub timer to 0?
[22:13] <realHans> hmm .. I always tried the 32 bit version of thePprogram ... <DOH>
=== zz_M4rc3l is now known as M4rc3l
[22:13] <haso> pfifo: newer packages of sofware in fast development.
[22:14] <pfifo> Roasted, ubuntu s sentient, it knows that its you, if you mom resumed it it would ask for password
[22:14] <Roasted> pfifo, except I did it 10 times in a row and 3 times it forgot
[22:14] <pfifo> haso, you should either find a ppa on launchpad.net or compile from the packages subversion/git repo's
[22:15] <ben_> elgaton: For group and user?
[22:15] <kaparen> I installed Gnomeshell on Ubuntu 11.10 it works fine except that it doesn't have minimize and maximize on the top of the windows. Is it supposed to be like that?
[22:15] <Roasted> kaparen, yes

[22:19] <aouldr78> i am trying to install Vmware server 2 on ubuntu 11.10 but it is asking me the location of c headers directory! any help?
[22:19] <pfifo> haso, of course I do, I wouldnt run debain if i didnt
[22:20] <aouldr78> where is location of c headers directory of ubuntu 11.10?
[22:20] <elgaton> aouldr78: It should be /usr/include
[22:20] <linelevel> pfifo: Well, I know the answer to that.. It's because there are no good linux drivers for my particular wireless card. But other networks work fine in Linux, and this network works fine in Linux when I'm closer to the router.
[22:20] <ben_> elgaton: Ok, did that, restarted apache, but it doesn't look like httpd.conf is having any effect. I'm looking at PHP's phpinfo() output.
[22:20] <linelevel> pfifo: Therefore, I'm thinking that these linux drivers are just bad at dealing with relatively weak signals.
[22:20] <linelevel> pfifo: And that by amplifying the signal, I'll solve the problem.

[22:46] <pfifo> !grub | Nertskull the second link here
[22:46] <ubottu> Nertskull the second link here: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)

[22:47] <rockstar09> mmk
[22:47] <PhoenixSTF> upstairss, you can edit a file on /etc/grub.d/
[22:48] <Nertskull> So I HAVE to use grub? I can't just let each bootloader stay on separate disks and use bios to select which disk to go to?
[22:48] <Nertskull> And change in bios which one to boot first?
[22:48] <pfifo> Nertskull, depends on your bios
[22:49] <pfifo> Nertskull, ubuntu will still need grub installed to boot anyway so you might as well just use it to dual boot
[22:49] <PhoenixSTF> upstairss, you can call it 35_fedora and copy your fedora menu entry to it with the correct drives for grub, but try reading on grub with 2 linux os maybe you have to put /boot on a diferent partition
[22:50] <Nertskull> I just figured since I already have grub and everything working fine on this drive, i would hate to mess things up.
[22:50] <Nertskull> But if that's really the best way, i guess its time to learn grub

[23:00] <derbosepirat> ciaoo
[23:00] <yhahn> ikonia: so the best course of action is to try the 3.0.9 mainline build, confirm (or not) whether it fixes the issue and update the issue as such?

[23:19] <LSymonds> aguitel: It is a command line tool.
[23:20] <LSymonds> Kangarooo: Of course you can't, it's virtualisation which means it is using the hardware which is currently working on your system. For best results you should do it on a seperate partition, machine or use Wubi if you are on Windows.
[23:20] <Genjie> all...
[23:20] <ikonia> Genjie: final warning - stop it

[23:32] <bjrohan> I recently adjusted my HD partitions, including my swap part.  In doing so I had to use boot-repair to get grub to work correctly. Do I need to do anything special to get Ubuntu to see and use the swap partition?
[23:32] <pfifo> qmanjr5, and your port is forwarded through your router? (or direct connection to the internet)
[23:32] <iceroot> bjrohan: swap must be named in /etc/fstab
[23:32] <qmanjr5> Unfortunately, I have no idea. It's always worked at full speeds before now, so I've never bothered to check what's going on with the ports
[23:33] <Kangarooo> ah yes- in transmision left bottom is turtle and left from it is limit speed. check that to be unlimited. otherwise somebody else in home using net very fast or check system tools if u not dl something else aka using net speed already- all of it
[23:33] <firmevato> My harddrive and wireless  lights are blinking like crazy, but I don't think I have anything running that should be taxing my system so hard. How can I check what's using all my bandwidth and running the harddrive in ubuntu 10.04? Thanks in advance!
[23:33] <pfifo> qmanjr5, goto the network tab in prefrences and click the test port button
[23:33] <LSymonds> qmanjr5 have you tried FatRat?
=== Auriel_ is now known as Auriel
[23:33] <kalamajo> everytime i try to install ubuntu or load it, the screen goes blank
[23:34] <qmanjr5> It has to be Transmisison, as qBittorent is full speed
[23:34] <kalamajo> and doesnt do anything
[23:34] <bjrohan> iceroot, from what I can tell, it is not listed I have a line that says swap was on /dev/sda5 my swap is now /dev/sda2, how do I rectify correctly?
[23:34] <qmanjr5> Port is closed it says...
[23:34] <qmanjr5> Odd
[23:34] <Kangarooo> kalamajo: is it 11.04 or 11.10 yes? but not 10.04 right?
[23:34] <qmanjr5> which port should I be using?
[23:34] <LSymonds> qmanjr5: Edit -> Preferences -> Speed see if anything is checked.
[23:34] <kalamajo> ubuntu-11.10-desktop-
[23:34] <LSymonds> qmanjr5: 51413
[23:34] <pfifo> qmanjr5, 51413 is the default port
[23:34] <qmanjr5> LSymonds, nothing
[23:35] <qmanjr5> Yeah, that's what is listed
[23:35] <qmanjr5> but it's closed....
[23:35] <qmanjr5> And I've never changed it
[23:35] <LSymonds> Ah right.
[23:35] <LSymonds> Mine is closed also and it downloads at full speed.
[23:35] <kalamajo> is it my video card?
[23:35] <qmanjr5> What
[23:35] <qmanjr5> That's odd.
[23:35] <kalamajo> i have an ati 5850 and a 58530
[23:35] <kalamajo> i tried both
[23:35] <LSymonds> qmanjr5: Try and enable them anyway, worth a try.
[23:35] <kalamajo> same result tho
[23:35] <Kangarooo> kalamajo: try reproducint bug im having on eMachines e525. before pressing enter to start live session change brightnes down and up for 1 in/de creasment and then enter live and if works- tell me
[23:36] <pfifo> qmanjr5, my guess is that another computer requested 51413 via UPnP and you router currently has it assigned to that computer, try changing the port to something else and restart transmission, then test again
[23:38] <qmanjr5> pfifo, no other computers on my network. Just a PS3
[23:38] <qmanjr5> what port should I change it to?
[23:38] <LSymonds> 1337
[23:38] <LSymonds> "for the lulz?"
[23:38] <qmanjr5> Lol :P
[23:38] <LSymonds> Anything really
[23:38] <LSymonds> makes no difference
[23:38] <qmanjr5> Status Unkown
[23:38] <qmanjr5> XD
[23:38] <pfifo> qmanjr5, it dosent matter, anything above 1024 is fine... no not 1337 your ISP might block it
[23:39] <LSymonds> Jeeze I'm tired.
[23:40] <qmanjr5> pfifo, LSymonds nothing.
[23:40] <kalamajo> how do you increase brightness while in that menu
[23:40] <LSymonds> I have no idea then qmanjr5, can you use another program for the time being?
[23:40] <pfifo> qmanjr5, well then go into your router and manually forward a port
[23:40] <LSymonds> Maybe there is a bug or something.
[23:41] <qmanjr5> LSymonds, Yeah, I guess I'll use qBittorrent. When I add a torrent to qBittorent...how the hell do I choose which files to download?
[23:41] <qmanjr5> :P
[23:41] <LSymonds> Don't know qmanjr5, never used it.

[23:44] <pfifo> bjrohan, sorry swapon -s
[23:44] <bjrohan> pfifo and zykitick9 nope :-( swapon -a gives this swapon: cannot find the device for UUID=5adf542e-d551-4de8-abe4-5eabe1674641
[23:44] <bjrohan> free shows: swapon: cannot find the device for UUID=5adf542e-d551-4de8-abe4-5eabe1674641
[23:44] <zykotick9> bjrohan, check your fstab
[23:44] <LSymonds> theshadow: can you post all of your code?
[23:45] <bjrohan> zykotick9 - what am I looking for? i have a line commented out that says where it was during installation, but that /dev no longer exists after adjusting partitions
[23:46] <zykotick9> bjrohan, the UUID for your swap is probably not correct
[23:46] <theshadow> LSymonds: do you mean the error code?
[23:46] <firmevato> My harddrive and wireless  lights are blinking like crazy, but I don't think I have anything running that should be taxing my system so hard. How can I check what's using all my bandwidth and running the harddrive in ubuntu 10.04? Thanks in advance!
[23:46] <LSymonds> theshadow: No, your program.
[23:46] <zykotick9> bjrohan, you can use "sudo blkid" to see what's it really is, then be sure that same UUID is in your fstab
[23:47] <slong002> I installed Ubuntu 11.10 alongside Vista Home a month ago.  The machine has been used only for websurfing with no problems until this afternoon.  Now, the wired internet connection fails shorty after booting, but Ubuntu shows no problems with internet connectivty.  However, it works briefly after rebooting.  Connection is great with Vista.  Any ideas?
[23:47] <theshadow> LSymonds, we were just trying to import from that and it's failing
[23:47] <LSymonds> I think you have to import the whole module
[23:47] <LSymonds> import urllib
[23:48] <theshadow> that succeds but then we can't request urlopen. it doesn't exist.
[23:49] <theborger> hey do i need Compiz running?
[23:49] <bjrohan> zykotick9 There is nothing correct in my fstab for the swap partition, the dev name, nor UUID
[23:49] <zykotick9> theborger, are you using unity3d?  if so, then yes.
[23:49] <LSymonds> Wait
[23:49] <LSymonds> it's httplib
[23:49] <LSymonds> theshadow try httplib
[23:49] <theborger> zykotick9: i just have gnome running, using xbox media center on this pc
[23:50] <usr13> slong002: Not much to go on here.....
[23:50] <zykotick9> bjrohan, use one or the other UUID or dev name - not both.  Correct it then.
[23:50] <zykotick9> theborger, if you're using gnome then it's optional, you cause use metacity instead
[23:50] <usr13> slong002: ... you are not telling us what sort of problem you are having with internet connectivity.
[23:50] <bjrohan> zykotick9, I can enable in gparted, then apply changes correct?
[23:50] <zykotick9> s/cause/could/
[23:51] <Kangarooo> kalamajo: ah i thought ur in laptop maybe then u have some other bug. u can make attention to user to who ur writing in irc by start writing first letter of nick then [tab]
[23:51] <zykotick9> bjrohan, ahhh, i'm not touching that one.  good luck.
[23:51] <bjrohan> zykotick9,  Actually I enabled on Gparted by right clicking on it then selecting swapon, but it doesn't allow me to apply
[23:52] <zykotick9> bjrohan, sorry i can't help further, good luck.
[23:52] <bjrohan> zykotick9 my mental issue wit fstab is that the line is commented out and all wrong that is why I am hesitant to manually change it
[23:52] <jiujimk> use gparted with sudo command
[23:52] <kalamajo> Kangarooo ok
[23:52] <usr13> slong002: Lost IP address?  Lost route?  Unable to resolve domain name?  or...?
[23:52] <kalamajo> Kangarooo: I am pretty sure its the video card
[23:53] <slong002> usr13: Unable to resolve domain name
[23:53] <kalamajo> because everything is fine, then the monitor just shuts down, like going into stand by mode
[23:53] <kalamajo> brb going to take this monitor over there and see if that will work for some reason
[23:54] <usr13> slong002: Ok then.  Try editing /etc/resolv.conf and see what's there, see if that IP can be pinged, replace it with a known-to-be-good nameserver.

[00:00] <_calum> I'm looking for a piece of software which will generate tcp / udp packets and send them to a target, does such software exist for Ubuntu?

[00:01] <firmevato> ikonia, how about my porn keeps buffering due to the lack of bandwidth?

[00:01] <slong002> usr13 no wireless adapter on the pc. its just connect to a port on te wireless router.
[00:01] <firmevato> so after making a worthless comment, do you have any real help for me?
[00:02] <_calum> ikonia:I want to test a computer's response to tcp / udp traffic, firewall test etc
[00:02] <ikonia> firmevato: well, flashing lights just mean device in use, that is not a bad thing
[00:02] <firmevato> well, how about i tell you THEY DON'T NORMALLY FLASH THIS MUCH.
[00:02] <firmevato> something is taking up my bandwidth and running the harddrive so the computer is less responsive than normal
[00:02] <ikonia> firmevato: calm down, stop typing in caps, I'm having a normal converation and you seem to be keen to be disruptive
[00:02] <firmevato> the computer is slow, ok?
[00:02] <slong002> usr13: no wireless adapter on the pc. its just connect to a port on te wireless router.
[00:03] <ikonia> firmevato: ok, run "top" and see if any processes are "busy"
[00:03] <firmevato> thank you!
[00:03] <ikonia> _calum: tell telneting to an active/dead port will test TCP,
[00:03] <ikonia> _calum: using a dns server and doing fake transfers/lookups will test udp
[00:03] <ikonia> those are simple tests that take about an hour to setup
[00:03] <firmevato> that's all I needed. thanks.
[00:03] <ikonia> there are also non-specific tools such as "ping" for tcp
[00:04] <firmevato> for some reason "java" is the most active process.
[00:04] <ikonia> and there used to be a tool called "udpdump"
[00:04] <_calum> ikonia:Does ubuntu have packet generation software?
[00:04] <dcherniv> _calum, apache's "ab" might be what you're looking for]
[00:04] <ikonia> _calum: there are many tools for, it depends on what you what to generate, eg: "ping" will generate packages, but are they what you want ?
[00:05] <_calum> I want to test my windows firewall program
[00:05] <firmevato> ok I did "kill -9 (java pid)" and it automatically restarted and is running the cpu at 97% now?
[00:05] <ikonia> _calum: you said earlier nmap has those capabilities
[00:05] <ikonia> firmevato: just reboot
[00:06] <firmevato> ok, brb.
[00:06] <InvaderZim> Using unity, how can I move the top bar/panel to the bottom?
[00:06] <_calum> yeah but not necessarily to test open/closed ports but to check that it blocks attempts
[00:07] <ikonia> _calum: what ?
[00:07] <ikonia> _calum: testing open/closed ports IS it blocking attempts
[00:07] <ikonia> _calum: eg: if you test an closed port and it reports it as "open" it's not working
[00:07] <ikonia> _calum: if you test a closed port and it reports closed, it's worked
[00:07] <_calum> how reliable is nmap though

[00:08] <AnttiM> Hi, I'm trying to boot Ubuntu Live from USB stick, but it just gets into an endless loop of reboots
[00:09] <_calum> What kind of traffic would be seen if a port scan was taking place on windows? Multiple connections to many tcp ports?
[00:09] <AnttiM> can anyone help me in this matter?
[00:10] <ikonia> _calum: it basically just throws a few packets at a port trying to make a connection, and the response from the remote device determains it's status
[00:10] <ikonia> _calum: depends how you configure it - nmap will do what you tell it to do
[00:11] <utente1> русские есть?
[00:11] <_calum> so ACK = open port, RST closed port, no response = dropped packet?
[00:11] <ikonia> _calum: check the documentation for status
[00:12] <firmevato> ikonia, I rebooted the computer and java started automatically again, and it's maxing out the CPU. When I kill -9 it, it restarts automatically with a new PID.
[00:12] <czx> how to copy a file witout replace?
[00:12] <_calum> thanks ikonia, I will look through nmap docs
[00:12] <ikonia> firmevato: so before you did anything, no browsers open or anything like that, java just started
[00:12] <pfifo> firmevato, do you use freenet?
[00:13] <firmevato> that is correct. actually yes I just did install freenet recently. I think you've got it.
[00:13] <firmevato> thank you.
[00:13] <tonyyarusso> czx: what do you mean?
[00:13] <pfifo> ikonia, freenet adds an entry to cron
[00:13] <ikonia> pfifo: that sounds bad
[00:13] <czx> to copy a file not replacing destination
[00:13] <firmevato> I just shut down freenet and the java PID is no longer running

[00:29] <czx> I need copied file to blend permissions and owner and acl, will cp copy them instead?
[00:29] <pfifo> itsonlyme, deleting the partition dosent affect the filesystem, you just need to use fdisk to recreate the partition
[00:30] <itsonlyme> I tried recreating the partition, but there's nothing there.
[00:30] <pfifo> itsonlyme, did you reformat?
[00:30] <itsonlyme> Its created an empty partition, maybe formatted automatically.

[00:49] <freezway> hey all, how can I tell which sensors "sensors" outpiuts is which? it just says temp1 temp2 and temp3
[00:49] <Nichola> yes, I am booting from a usb and sometimes I get to the purple screen with the ubuntu graphic, sometimes I don't. When I do get to the purple screen, it never goes past the place where the dots are loading.
[00:50] <Nichola> Sometimes it has gone to the place that the dots all turn orange and then start to turn back to white, but never has gotten past the last two dots turning back to white...
[00:51] <Nichola> (don't know if any of that is helpful/useful but that is what I get to....)
[00:51] <pfifo> Nichola, pres F2 to turn off the splash and tell us what it says its doing
[00:56] <osmodivs_> Hello, what is the name of the package I need to install in order to have a search box in Synaptic? all I have is this search icon, I have to press it and then imput a name and then search, wich is kind of annoying. I nstalled 9menu, but still dont have that box
[00:58] <Javid_> does anyone here know much about installng totem plugins?
[01:00] <zabomber> Javid_: what plugin?
[01:01] <Javid_> zabomber: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/01/airplay-video-playback-comes-to-totem/
[01:02] <CharminTheMoose> How much of a security risk is it to let normal users have access to the shutdown/reboot binary in a single user system?
[01:02] <parcs> in general, how seamless is the upgrade process between releases?
[01:03] <Nichola> eek! I tried one more time, and it got past the dots. I am now looking at a welcome screen, but can't move the mouse...
[01:03] <Nichola> how do I select my options
[01:07] <Javid_> Good lord, this should not be this difficult.

[01:14] <zykotick9> parcs, not one of ubuntu's strong points really
[01:15] <Nichola> I am a total newbie to ubuntu....
[01:15] <puff> What's going on?
[01:15] <pnorman> I found the upgrade seamless with ubuntu-server at home. When I tried upgrading my door to 11.something, it didn't work so well
[01:15] <puff> "door"?
[01:15] <tkruise> door?
[01:15] <pnorman> My door at work runs ubuntu
[01:15] <usr13> Gateway?
[01:15] <puff> pnorman: The door at your office?
[01:16] <pnorman> puff: lab door
[01:16] <puff> Oooookay.
[01:16] <Javid_> My door needs help installing a totem plugin, if that's what it takes to get attention in here.
[01:16] <pnorman> Instead of a window in the top of it, it has an LCD panel
[01:16] <usr13> what's a lab door?
[01:16] <puff> Anyway, I'm a somewhat experienced ubuntu user, but I have to go meet somebody for dinner, so I only have a few minutes if folks have specific questions.
[01:17] <pnorman> usr13: a method of access control into a room.
[01:17] <usr13> i c
[01:17] <puff> So your lab has a smart door?
[01:17] <Javid_> usr13: in english we use entire words, try it
[01:17] <pnorman> It wasn't too smart - not interactive, just displayed a slideshow.
[01:18] <pnorman> Well, there was the RFID based lock, but that didn't run ubuntu, and it wasn't very smart either
[01:19] <usr13>  pnorman:  So what is your Ubuntu related question?
[01:21] <pnorman> I didn't have one. I was commenting on the upgrade process since someone asked about it.

[01:26] <yoaino3v> Alright I'm there
[01:26] <laserdude> So we are using ocelot and whenever we are trying to boot, it stops when it reaches the bootsplash
[01:26] <s0nee> silverrocker: hmm then try "export DISPLAY=??"
[01:26] <Javid_> Hello?
[01:26] <usr13> Javid_: What is your question?
[01:26] <iostream_2003> hi
[01:27] <glr> Has any one had luck installing the nvidia drivers on their laptop?
[01:27] <zykotick9> !nomodeset | laserdude
[01:27] <ubottu> laserdude: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[01:27] <chelz> i'm working off of a copy of a drive, is there a way to make Testdisk destructively operate on it, as in write, etc?

[01:27] <laserdude> Thank you, bot, but I am pretty sure it's not that.
[01:27] <usr13> Javid_: What is your problem?
[01:28] <laserdude> Since we can use the screen in the live CD
[01:28] <Javid_> usr13: Same one I've been asking - I'm trying to install a totem plugin but iit won't show up in the plugins list
[01:28] <silverrocker> s0nee: I tryied export DISPLAY=0 but didn't help
[01:28] <usr13> Javid_: Which plugin?
[01:28] <usr13> silverrocker: Try  export DISPLAY=:0
[01:29] <s0nee> silverrocker: i dont get it. you want to startx, but not on your local machine ?
[01:29] <Javid_> usr13: totem-plugin-airplay
[01:29] <usr13> or export DISPLAY=:0.0
[01:29] <zykotick9> silverrocker, do you have gdm on that box?  "sudo service gdm start" or lightdm if you're using 11.10.  I doubt you can startx with an export (but could be wrong).
[01:29] <silverrocker> s0nee: what I'm trying to accomplish is to start x on the machine I'm logged in without really binding myself to that x instance
[01:30] <silverrocker> zykotick9: nope, dont have any login managers
[01:30] <KillaByte> does anyone know how to view the manpages via terminal
[01:30] <s0nee> silverrocker: then im pretty sure you can set the display with "export DISPLAY=:xx" but you have to figure out the xx yourself
[01:30] <laserdude> KillaByte: man
[01:30] <zykotick9> KillaByte, "man programyouwant"
[01:30] <silverrocker> s0nee: I don't have any displays running I think

[01:32] <djexq> can anyone help?
[01:32] <Javid_> zabomber: yes
[01:32] <dcherniv> silverrocker, you logged in with ssh?
[01:32] <Srbuntu> when i transfer from my mobile phone files
[01:33] <zabomber> Javid_: mmm... give me 5
[01:33] <Javid_> zabomber: ok :]
[01:33] <silverrocker> dcherniv: yees
[01:33] <Srbuntu> my pc freez
[01:33] <s0nee> silverrocker: no display running ?
[01:33] <newbie|2> lol
[01:33] <silverrocker> s0nee: don't think so
[01:33] <dcherniv> silverrocker, you want to start X on the remote machine?
[01:33] <silverrocker> dcherniv: yes
[01:33] <dcherniv> silverrocker, DISPLAY=:0 startx
[01:34] <procrastubator> So I'm trying to boot Ubuntu
[01:34] <usr13> Javid_: ls /usr/share/totem/
[01:34] <silverrocker> Fatal server error: no screens found
[01:34] <procrastubator> everytime I try to boot Ubuntu from a usb to install it, it never recognizes wireless connections
[01:34] <dcherniv> silverrocker, is X server setup properly on the remote machine?
[01:34] <dcherniv> silverrocker, ie can you run it locally?
[01:34] <usr13> Javid_: ls /usr/lib/totem/plugins/
[01:34] <Javid_> usr13: what am I looking for? or just paste the result?
[01:35] <dcherniv> silverrocker, is there an actual monitor connected?
[01:35] <djexq> can anyone help with a priviledge issue?
[01:35] <usr13> djexq: Yes
[01:35] <silverrocker> dcherniv: well I can't test that but I remember having a monitor plugged into it
[01:35] <djexq> wonderful! thank you :)
[01:35] <Javid_> usr13: I see. Looks like the guide I had gave me the wrong plugin folder.. let's see here
[01:35] <s0nee> silverrocker: you may want to check the xorg configuration file ?
[01:35] <usr13> Javid_: Yes, should be: /usr/lib/totem/plugins/
[01:36] <dcherniv> silverrocker, i had that when machine was running headless and X nowadays detects a monitor. solved by manually specifying screen in xorg.conf
[01:36] <dcherniv> silverrocker, not sure if xorg.conf even works still with latest ubuntu
[01:36] <iostream_2003> hey people
[01:36] <djexq> okay, so i installed 11.10 under windows & am now booted into it. i try to go to the root folder of my drive, but it says that i don't have permission
[01:36] <silverrocker> dcherniv: I think this machine has 10.04
[01:37] <usr13> djexq: sudo
[01:37] <knish809> Has the touchpad double tap and hold problem been solved yet?
[01:37] <dcherniv> silverrocker, check to see if there's an xorg.conf somewhere, not sure where ubuntu puts it now, used to be in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:37] <usr13> djexq: What do you need that is in the root folder of your drive?
[01:37] <procrastubator> Guys what do I need to know about figuring out how to get Ubuntu to see wireless connections?
[01:38] <usr13> dcherniv: Still in /etc/X11/
[01:38]  * yoaino3v This Winehq IRC room is full of **sholes
[01:38] <djexq> i don't even know if i really need to go to the root folder, but i'd like to be able to get to the windows partition to access my music
[01:38] <usr13> procrastubator: iwconfig
[01:38] <bekks> djexq: then just mount it
[01:38] <usr13> djexq: man fstab
[01:38] <usr13> read....
[01:38] <knish809> i did some xorg.conf mods and got a little action, but it's still not right.
[01:39] <Javid_> usr13: putting the plugin files there doesn't seem to have worked either
[01:39] <procrastubator> usr13: and then what?
[01:39] <Rya_n> Mildly annoying problem... Side by side, the text of my desktop icons overlap.
[01:39] <zabomber> usr13: same result as Javid_
[01:39] <djexq> thank you, reading now. i'll let you know what happens
[01:39] <silverrocker> dcherniv, actually I'm just trying to run a script which does some work for me but fails with FATAL: Cannot initialize video driver. from mencoder or mplayer and I'm guessing I would need x to solve that?
[01:40] <usr13> procrastubator: what does iwconfig say about your wifi device?
[01:40] <procrastubator> usr13: I'll login from Ubuntu and come back here through another computer in a minute, it'll be much more convenient than booting back and forth. Be back in two
[01:40] <Rya_n> Is there a way to narrow desktop icons text, or get rid of it altogether?
[01:40] <dcherniv> silverrocker, a video conversion script?
[01:40] <silverrocker> dcherniv: yes
[01:41] <dcherniv> silverrocker, can you pastebin it?
[01:41] <silverrocker> dcherniv: the script?
[01:41] <dcherniv> silverrocker, you shouldnt need X for that
[01:41] <dcherniv> silverrocker, yea
[01:41] <KillaByte> i am trying to become more familiar with the terminal  does anyone havelinks for a noob?
[01:41] <silverrocker> yes, that wouldn't be logical
[01:42] <usr13> Javid_: How did you install the totem plugin?
[01:42] <usr13> Javid_: Did you use the package manager?
[01:42] <Javid_> usr13: via the directions here: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/01/airplay-video-playback-comes-to-totem/
[01:43] <Darkenvy> I have a website and I want to symlink a log folder that is located inside of "~/root". How can I do this? I want a directory like "xxxxx.com/logs/"
[01:44] <Darkenvy> If I symlink it denies me permission to view the folder on "xxxx.com/logs/". My website does handle directory listing btw. "xxxx.com/images/" lists
[01:44] <djexq> usr13: is there any particular reason that under system settings, users & groups is not displayed. it is only users
[01:45] <usr13> Javid_: Did you move the files into /usr/lib/totem/plugins/  ?
[01:45] <Javid_> usr13: I did indeed
[01:49] <usr13> Javid_: I don't know for sure.
[01:50] <usr13> Javid_: Try sudo apt-get install totem-plugins-extra totem-plugins
[01:50] <djexq> does anyone know why groups wouldn't be available under system settings?
[01:50] <usr13> djexq: What are you trying to do?
[01:51] <usr13> djexq: Did  you read the manfile for fstab?
[01:51] <bekks> man 5 fstab
[01:52] <Javid_> usr13: ok, trying
[01:52] <djexq> usr13: yes, but to be honest, i really didn't understand exactly how to mount my ntfs partition
[01:53] <zabomber> djexq: what are you trying to do? have you install ntfs-3g?
[01:53] <usr13> djexq: sudo fdisk -l |pastebinit
[01:53] <Javid_> usr13: nope

[02:24] <L1nuxRules> tony you can only restrict repos easily youd need to grep , xargs and probably sed stuff to do what you want unless theres a gui tool
[02:24] <bonhoffer> lsof right?
[02:25] <L1nuxRules> bonhoffer netstat -ln | grep 3000

[02:27] <L1nuxRules> like I said it would need scripting to do waht you want i.e restrict it to packages, you can only restrict by repo at PM level unless things have changed in new distros Im old skool
[02:28] <L1nuxRules> bonhoffere that only works if theres an open session what I said works if its only listening

[02:43] <Rya_n> Mildly annoying problem: Side by side, the text of my desktop icons overlap.
[02:43] <altice> I guess I still don't get it, meh?
[02:43] <pfifo> altice, dont let others advise you how to help people you want to help
[02:44] <L1nuxRules> np ottscorp
[02:44] <altice> yep, with ya pfifo
[02:44] <Rya_n> How can I make the icon text narrower, or get rid of it altogether?
[02:44] <L1nuxRules> pfifo also dont advise people to advise people stuff above them
[02:45] <puff> Can somebody help me with my disappearing sound?
[02:45] <L1nuxRules> not aimed at altice but pfifo
[02:45] <altice> L1nuxRules: also don't advise people to not advice people that say not to advise other people ;)
[02:45] <altice> this is becoming recursive......
[02:45] <altice> I like it
[02:45] <apwbdjp> !sound | puff
[02:45] <ubottu> puff: If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
[02:45] <pfifo> !recursion
[02:46] <L1nuxRules> I advise not to advise things that break things without the user who does being able to know enough to fix it!

[02:47] <altice> hehe, this is becoming a silly conversation
[02:47] <altice> I feel as if this is a Mad Hatter tea party
[02:47] <L1nuxRules> or advising people how to gain security rights :)

[02:49] <OttScorp> Another questions.. sorry.. I find printing from Lubuntu 11.10 to my usb connected HP Laserjet 1200 to be slow compared to Windows.. for a typical document it takes about 10 minutes compared to less than one minute under Windows.. is that normal for Linux?
[02:49] <L1nuxRules> Why is Linux more secure than windows > altice | < L1nuxRules
[02:49] <L1nuxRules>  windows > altice | < L1nuxRules invalid syntax I knw
[02:50] <puff> apwbdjp: Thanks, already tried the volume control and settings, I'll check out those pages.
[02:50] <apwbdjp> L1nuxRules, who cares about people's intention? You're volunteering to help people with using an OS whose entire idea is based on free information.
[02:50] <OttScorp> Speaking of Security.. Is Apparmour on by default in Ubuntu/Lubuntu 11.10?
[02:50] <bonhoffer> what is the shortcut key for killing an app?
[02:50] <bonhoffer> (alt+f4 for ubunut (11.10))?
[02:51] <L1nuxRules> <apwbdjp> Ive shouted to loud , sorry
[02:51] <OttScorp> lol bonhoffer :-)  I think he probably mean that a app has hung or has stopped responding :-)
[02:51] <OttScorp> not sure about a shortcut key
[02:51] <apwbdjp> L1nuxRules, everyone can know anything. If we start restricting information, let's be Windows, and hide our source codes so that people don't know our security breaches.
[02:51] <OttScorp> look up the xkill command
[02:52] <bonhoffer> i would like it to be graceful -- not an app that has hung -- an app that is in my way
[02:52] <L1nuxRules> <apwbdjp> your on my level :)
[02:52] <OttScorp> minimize the app then?
[02:52] <L1nuxRules> bonhoffer killing it in gui or cli?
[02:53] <bonhoffer> gui
[02:53] <apwbdjp> L1nuxRules, this'll be my last off-topic comment. I like you L1nuxRules, I've been watching you help people for while now, and you're good really. No need to answer me.
[02:53] <bonhoffer> in cli i do kill -9 pid
[02:53] <Yerushalmi> Every so often, usually when something tries to play a sound, the sound icon disappears from my upper bar, then reappears at full volume. Even if sound was previously muted. If I'm trying to watch something with no sound or just not have popup windows make "bonk" noises when I'm in class this is extremely inconvenient and irritating. Can someone help me figure out why this is happening and...
[02:53] <Yerushalmi> ...stop it?
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[02:53] <L1nuxRules> best way I know is open a shell type xkill then point the x on the window you want to kill and left click
[02:54] <bonhoffer> hmm. . . i am sure there is an equivalent to "send the menu -- quit" signal
[02:54] <bonhoffer> well, sure is not a sure thing
[02:54] <OttScorp> but bonhoffer said that the app isn't "hung".. jsut in the way.. so minimize it??
[02:55] <L1nuxRules> <apwbdjp> ty
[02:55] <OttScorp> but xkill is good to know.. agreed with L1nuxRules
[02:55] <bonhoffer> yeah -- but i want it quit
[02:55] <bonhoffer> i can just do file quit
[02:55] <OttScorp> there ya go then.. file --> quite :-)
[02:55] <OttScorp> lol
[02:55] <bonhoffer> no biggie -- just surprising that windows 3.1 had this, but ubuntu doesn't
[02:56] <OttScorp> what doesn't Ubuntu have that Windows 3.1 has?
[02:56] <bonhoffer> i guess ms$ft has spent billions for something!
[02:56] <bonhoffer> alt+f4
[02:56] <bonhoffer> app is gracefully killed
[02:56] <OttScorp> alt-f4 works in Ubuntu
[02:56] <L1nuxRules> alt+f4 works in gnome
[02:56] <bonhoffer> oh, then standby
[02:57] <ArNezT> any one can help me please: E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) on install nagios3
[02:57] <OttScorp> standby works
[02:57] <L1nuxRules> ^^ or what you said
[02:57] <OttScorp> but are you using Gnome 3?
[02:57] <bonhoffer> works -- works great -- thanks!
[02:57] <bonhoffer> sorry i wasn't clear
[02:57] <L1nuxRules> arnetzt whats ps aux | grep dpkg show?
[02:57] <bonhoffer> <bonhoffer> (alt+f4 for ubunut (11.10))?
[02:58] <OttScorp> Not sure about Ubuntu since I use Lubuntu :-)
[02:58] <bonhoffer> (i could have tried alt+f4 but that would have been too easy)
[02:58] <OttScorp> I believe you'll have to go to the logout button or something
[02:58] <OttScorp> Can't help ya since I don't use Gnome 3
[02:58] <ArNezT> ps aux | grep dpkg show grep: show: No such file or directory
[02:59] <OttScorp> I prefer the LXDE desktop since it uses a lot less resources
[02:59] <apwbdjp> ArNezT, the show was in the question, the command is: ps aux | grep dpkg
[02:59] <ArNezT> ow ic :)
[03:00] <ArNezT> ps aux | grep dpkg : arnezt    6426  0.0  0.0   4164   868 pts/0    S+   09:59   0:00 grep -ia dpkg
[03:00] <L1nuxRules> arnezt I take its not in your path, try the full paths cant remeber of top of my head but will be in either /bin /sbin /usr/localbin or /usr/local/sbin
[03:00] <azriel> Does anyone know how to download all the gstreamer modules?
[03:00] <L1nuxRules> /usr/local/bin*
[03:01] <L1nuxRules> ^^ I just seen what you replied so no dpkg instances are running try running your command again but with sudo
[03:02] <apwbdjp> ArNezT, by your command, he means the apt-get you used to install (if that's what you used)
[03:03] <L1nuxRules> <apwbdjp> cheers
[03:03] <ArNezT> ok i'll try
[03:03] <azriel> i need certain modules for gstreamer and I'm having a hard time finding them so i just want to download all of them, a complete gstreamer
[03:04] <apwbdjp> azriel, http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/ one by one to apt-get install?
[03:04] <apwbdjp> azriel, they're not that many
[03:05] <azriel> thx
[03:05] <azriel> they all say unable to find package
[03:06] <apwbdjp> azriel, the names might vary. Use apt-get install gst[tab][tab], it'll give you a list
[03:07] <apwbdjp> To everyone else: No one knows of a single package that holds them all?
[03:07] <azriel>  do i type it as [tab][tab]?
[03:07] <L1nuxRules> azriel aptitude is better to deal with dependencies than apt-get sometimes
[03:07] <OttScorp> no you press the tab key
[03:07] <azriel> or do you mean use the tab key?
[03:08] <OttScorp> it's like an autocomplete thing
[03:08] <|Long|> hi, guys is there away on ssh screen to view the boot screen error msg?
[03:08] <apwbdjp> azbarcea_, tab key, twice
[03:08] <Yerushalmi> Every so often, usually when something tries to play a sound, the sound icon disappears from my upper bar, then reappears at full volume - even if sound was previously muted. If I'm trying to prevent popup windows from making "bonk" noises when I'm in class this is extremely inconvenient and irritating. Can someone help me figure out why this is happening and stop it?
[03:08] <Nichola> I am still working on my laptop trying to install ubuntu...I am back at the welcome screen with a frozen mousepad and can't tab either to select the options. I am trying to install to a gateway model W340UI if that helps any...
[03:08] <OttScorp> gives you a list of options based on what you typed
[03:08] <|Long|> hi, guys is there away on ssh screen to view the boot screen error msg?
[03:09] <L1nuxRules> |Long| yes check /var/log/dmesg
[03:09] <|Long|> thanks
[03:09] <Nichola> how long should I let this just set here before assuming it is stuck?
[03:09] <OttScorp> have you done a media check on the install cd Nichola?
[03:10] <OttScorp> any hard disk activity?
[03:10] <ebswift> i'm having trouble getting auto login to work - i have edited my user settings to 'Automatic Login' but i'm still prompted for a password at boot (11.10)
[03:11] <L1nuxRules> nichola could be the laptop power safe options (achpi or something) try disabling them during boot
[03:13] <OttScorp> ebswift: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutoLogin  not sure if this helps
[03:13] <azriel> what does [tab][tab] mean?
[03:14] <OttScorp> or this might be better http://ubuntuguide.net/ubuntu-11-10-how-to-auto-login-gnome-shell-gnome3-desktop
[03:14] <apwbdjp> Nichola, can you download and burn a Ubuntu alternate install CD?
[03:14] <OttScorp> azriel - it means to press the tab key itself twice
[03:14] <ebswift> thanks OttScorp, i'll give it a go
[03:14] <puff> apwbdjp: So, I went through all of those troubleshooting steps, no luck.
[03:15] <Nichola> well, I can't burn a cd, my drives, all of them have given up on me =(
[03:15] <Nichola> I am using a usb drive to install...
[03:15] <Nichola> are you thinking that is causing issues?
[03:16] <OttScorp> when you boot from the usb stick.. is there not an option to "check the install media"
[03:17] <L1nuxRules> your failed drives could be hanging the boot yes, you could try removing silet and splah fromm the boot option
[03:17] <OttScorp> I'll ask again.. during the install.. are there any hard disk activity during the install?
[03:17] <azriel> ottscorp apwbdjp: my fine sirs you have been more helpful to me than the rest of the internets and google combined
[03:17] <apwbdjp> Nichola, it shouldn't, just that the Ubuntu Live CD requires a lot of i/o, from a USB stick there's more chance of failure..
[03:17] <L1nuxRules> ^^ to get an error that is
[03:17] <Nichola> I am not sure how to check the power options. One thing about this computer, I am locked out of the BIOS. It is a used laptop.
[03:18] <apwbdjp> Nichola, okkay, that's hard. (even if you get through the install fine, you should consider removing the CMOS battery to reset the password, might come in handy later)
[03:18] <OttScorp> not sure if there is a cmos battery in laptops
[03:18] <OttScorp> k.. apwbdjp confirms cmos battery in laptops :-)
[03:18] <L1nuxRules> nichola at the grub prompt type e then scroll to the 2nd line and press e then delete the quiet and splash entries you should get an error during boot then
[03:19] <apwbdjp> puff, I didn't forget you, just hang on with me for a second
[03:19] <L1nuxRules> once youve modified grub press esc then b
[03:19] <Weisz> Allo
[03:19] <apwbdjp> L1nuxRules, he's far away from there yet, he's still trying to install
[03:20] <L1nuxRules> <apwbdjp> ok , I really need to read everything dont I :(
[03:20] <Morpheus34> 'ello
[03:21] <apwbdjp> Nichola, your laptop has ethernet connectivity, and can be connected with it right now, right?
[03:21] <Nichola> Okay, I read what you wrote, and can do that, once I figure out how to get to grub and what it is....=D
[03:21] <lolcat> Can I wget mms://mms-icanal-odc.online.no/norsk-ripub/autodistribusjon/NRK3_201111092212_KOID_200091_11_170_1000.wmv ?
[03:21] <usr13> lolcat: Sure, why not?
[03:21] <Nichola> yes, it does, if you mean through a cord?
[03:22] <dr_willis> lolcat:  try it and see? if not theres programs like streamtuner, or vlc, or others that can capture/save streams
[03:22] <lolcat> dr_willis: didn't want to

[03:22] <ArNezT> how repair users and group settings when i pressed Advanced Settings the form vibrating
[03:22] <apwbdjp> Nichola, Yep, it's what I meant
[03:22] <ArNezT> how to repair users and group settings when i pressed Advanced Settings the form vibrating?
[03:23] <Gremuchnik> Hi!  Quick question: I don't like Unity, but I do like GNOME3.  Will Ubuntu 12.04 offer GNOME3 without Unity, the regular "original" GNOME3
[03:23] <fellayaboy> can someone tell me why transmission halts my internet in ubuntu 11.04?  the port is opened and ive lowered the peers connections to about 5 and i still get my internet to halt on my wireless
[03:24] <OttScorp> try LXDE Gremuchnik :-)
[03:24] <apwbdjp> Nichola, do you have a working linux machine at your hand?
[03:24] <ArNezT> Gremuchnik: may be you can use ubuntu no-effect from login menu :)
[03:24] <Nichola> no
[03:24] <OttScorp> Ubuntu plans on sticking with Unity
[03:24] <L1nuxRules> gremuchink although I cant answer your question, you can install and use any desktop in Linux
[03:24] <usr13> lolcat: Oh, yea, myabe you need streamripper or something.  But if you just want to watch it, try gxine

[03:25] <MaynardWaters> I am trying to figure out how to mount a raid 5 array that was built with a fedora 12 mdadm program
[03:25] <Gremuchnik> Unity is called a GNOME plugin.  BUt does that mean that only a Unity-version of GNOME will be available in he future?
[03:25] <lolcat> pumafyre: Can I do it command line? I want it on my boxee box
[03:25] <apwbdjp> puff, you might wanna say your problem clearly (when did the problem happen, how is it showing up exactly? did you notice anything while troubleshooting, does the sound come back as some point, etc)
[03:25] <OttScorp> sorry ArnetzT.. don't know
[03:25] <MaynardWaters> I can see all of the drives and that they are raid autodetect, but I have no /dev/md*
[03:26] <apwbdjp> Nichola, I see.. can you make a USB stick from the Ubuntu Minimal CD? (that'll have a lot more chances of working)
