[06:23] <Titan8990> Flannel, sorry, to me vanilla = downloaded from kernel.org
[06:23] <Flannel> Titan8990: right, but when he said "Yes, out of the box" he obviously understands vanilla as default U kernel
[06:23] <crdlb> that is what it means, but I could see how somebody would misinterpret it :)
[06:24] <Titan8990> Flannel, good catch, I didn't understand its meaning
[06:24] <werdnum> /usr/lib/policykit/polkit-read-auth-helper: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/policykit/polkit-read-auth-helper: undefined symbol: kit_getpwnam
[06:24] <werdnum> eee
[06:27] <paulSterio> what is gcc?
[06:27] <nickrud> gnu c compiler iirc
[06:27] <Antioch> gnu c compiler
[06:27] <paulSterio> how do I update it?
[06:27] <paulSterio> or remove it
[06:27] <paulSterio> I've tried apt-get install gcc
[06:27] <Antioch> sudo aptitude install build-essential
[06:28] <nickrud> paulSterio, why? to upgrade from ubuntu's version, you'd need to compile or backport from jaunty
[06:28] <Antioch> should give you everything you need to compiler basic things
[06:28] <Antioch> compile*
[06:28] <Titan8990> paulSterio, what is your problem exactly?
[06:28] <DigitalKiwi> people compile stuff on ubuntu?
[06:28] <Titan8990> DigitalKiwi, they do, but its not recommended
[06:28] <nilson> Lol, people compile stuff on every distro
[06:28] <nickrud> DigitalKiwi, nah, all the dev's do their development on fedora
[06:28] <Titan8990> DigitalKiwi, also, people write their own code
[06:28] <nilson> Why would it not be recommended?
[06:28] <DigitalKiwi> I knew it!
[06:28] <nilson> That doesn't make sense.
[06:29] <DigitalKiwi> if I was an ubuntu dev I'd use fedora
[06:29] <DigitalKiwi> *nod8
[06:29] <DigitalKiwi> *
[06:29] <Antioch> lol why?
[06:29] <nickrud> nilson, more a matter of encouraging people to use the packager
[06:29] <ZykoticK9> nilson, if you manually compile install there is no package management, so it's hard to uninstall/update/etc...
[06:29] <nilson> I understand that, but I thgouth you meant against compiling in general
[06:29] <Antioch> I compile things on Ubuntu all the time. C, C++, C#, Java (if you consider the last two "compiled")
[06:29] <homecable> whats the most used webserver ?
[06:29] <homecable> apache22
[06:29] <nilson> I have to compile obscure research software at work all day :)
[06:29] <Titan8990> nilson, becuase A) its harder to uninstall programs that have been compiled from source B) it can cause conflicts with people who try to compile programs from source prior to removing versions they have got from the repos
[06:30] <Titan8990> homecable, netcraft.com
[06:30] <Neverb> how is utility, forces readline input named?
[06:30] <nilson> Yeah I always try to use the package manager on my distro
[06:30] <nilson> I don't work with software that exists in software repos though :P
[06:31] <Antioch> you could compile & build your own package before installing it
[06:31] <Antioch> then you'd be able to remove it and upgrade it safely
[06:31] <Antioch> ;)
[06:31] <crdlb> a better idea is to use /opt/somedir for the prefix
[06:31] <Titan8990> nilson, then maybe ubuntu is not the best choice?
[06:31] <paulSterio> Antioch,  ok took your advice to build-essential. I'm still getting this gcc issue when I try and easy_install reportlab
[06:31] <paulSterio> http://dpaste.com/5050/
[06:31] <nickrud> Titan8990, there's nothing wrong with using ubuntu as a developement platform
[06:31] <oh_noes> Titan8990: no, theres two versions, linux and windows.  ANd by vanilla kernel, I meant whatever Ubuntu 8.10 Server installed off the CD
[06:32] <nilson> That's true, I need to look into building RPMs. Titan8990, no it's a RHEL system at work. I thought originally that you were against using Ubuntu for compiling in general; not neccesarily to install software in this manager
[06:32] <paulSterio> why is it doing this on ubuntu 8.10?
[06:32] <Ademan> does anyone know how I could run a process after a given amount of idle time? (as root) is that something i could do via upstart?
[06:32] <Antioch> Not loading, but I'll bet there's some package xyz-dev youre missing
[06:32] <crdlb> paulSterio: heh, because you don't have python-dev :)
[06:32] <Antioch> or some lib-dev
[06:33] <Antioch> There ya go!
[06:33] <Titan8990> oh_noes, and both versions only contain documentation for windows?
[06:33] <Antioch> Too bad dpaste isnt loading for me or I woulda beat you to it!
[06:33] <crdlb> the first line "error: Python.h: No such file or directory" is your clue
[06:33] <Flannel> paulSterio: Looks like you're missing a dev fil for python
[06:33] <ZykoticK9> Ademan, look into the "sleep" command
[06:33] <paulSterio> are you serious
[06:33] <nickrud> paulSterio, I think you need python-dev
[06:34] <paulSterio> yea I've already started the process
[06:34] <ZykoticK9> Ademan, sorry think i misinterpreted the question
[06:34] <Ademan> ZykoticK9: i was about to say :-p but thanks for the response
[06:34]  * nilson is upgrading to Jaunty A5 at this point...
[06:34] <rww> !jaunty | nilson
[06:34] <ubottu> nilson: Jaunty Jackalope is the code for Ubuntu 9.04, due April 2009 - Lots of breakage between now and April - Please join #ubuntu+1 for discussion and support.
[06:34] <Titan8990> nickrud, as for development its fine, but if you plan on installing lots of programs from source in order to use them, ubuntu would not be my recommendation
[06:34] <rww> nilson: enjoy your lots of breakage!
[06:34] <nilson> I like it
[06:34] <nilson> lol
[06:34] <Antioch> paulSterio, That's the first thing to check when building something new. Make sure you've got the right libraries and dev pacakges :)
[06:35] <nilson> I've been using Jaunty for a while now
[06:35] <oh_noes> Titan8990:  I guess so.  The Windows versions comes with ovftools.exe
[06:35] <oh_noes> so the version i have is right
[06:35] <nickrud> Titan8990, not a problem; I would myself. nice tools for packaging up whatever I compile, or fooling the packaging system into using my versions if needed
[06:35] <paulSterio> yea but where did it tell you that you needed python-dev?
[06:35] <paulSterio> nope
[06:36] <paulSterio> still got the same error
[06:36] <Titan8990> oh_noes, my only suggestion would be to try adding that directory to your path
[06:36] <Antioch> Well it said it was missing python.h - which is a piece of source code (a header file for a library)
[06:36] <nickrud> paulSterio, it asked for Python.h ; try python2.5-dev
[06:36] <crdlb> paulSterio: python-dev is what provides the python development headers
[06:36] <Titan8990> oh_noes, but only temporarily
[06:37] <nickrud> paulSterio, what I did was apt-file search Python.h . the apt-file package helps find what package a file is in

[06:37] <aprilhare> i'm having a problem with virtualbox ose: i installed solaris on vbox and i can't get the audio working. 1) is it a ubuntu problem or a solaris problem? 2) what do i do? :)
=== ivanoats is now known as ivanoats|away
[06:38] <rww> aprilhare: it's a solaris or #vbox problem
[06:38] <Seper> Sounds like a vb problem
[06:38] <[saat_koneksi_le> #semarang
[06:39] <Seper> aprilhare: If the audio in Ubuntu is working, then I think you can eliminate Ubuntu as the problem
[06:39] <[saat_koneksi_le> join/#semarang
[06:39] <rww> [saat_koneksi_le: /join #semarang
[06:39] <aprilhare> Seper: well it does give me a choice for host driver between oss, alsa and pulseaudio - which should i persevere with?
[06:40] <aprilhare> oh and null. but i assumed null bad.
[06:40] <Seper> aprilhare: I believe the default for Intrepid is now pulse
[06:41] <aprilhare> Seper: thanks that's what i last set thou :)
[06:41] <Seper> aprilhare: I would try each of them in turn and simply reboot the vbox, since here are only 3 choices.
[06:41] <Chaorain> I use vista and Wubi on my laptop with bluetooth built in and I would like to use my bt mouse with both Ubuntu and Vista but I can only use it with one at a time as I have to re-pair it each time. Any Help?
[06:42] <homeskill> how come i cant ctrl+pgup eve one page? i'm using screen(1) in the default ubuntu terminal
[06:42] <aprilhare> actually i think i've chosen all three by now
[06:42] <Seper> aprilhare: If it makes no sound on any of the choices, then I would reset it to pulse or alsa, and look to see if I could find a prob with solaris.
[06:42] <Chaorain> Also which  is best for full screen games? Gnome, KDE, or XFCE?
[06:42] <aprilhare> Seper: oh there are plenty of problems with solaris but i must learn :) thanks anyway
=== ivanoats|away is now known as ivanoats
[06:43] <Seper> aprilhare: Setting my programs to Alsa seems to often work as good or better than setting to pulse. fyi
[06:43] <Seper> aprilhare: That's just my personal experience
[06:44] <Seper> Chaorain: The only real difference is the amount of RAM they consume while loaded.
[06:45] <Seper> Chaorain: If you want a real noticeable improvement, you might have to use something like fluxbox
[06:46] <Chaorain> Seper, So how much ram do they use? about. like KDE > Gnome > XFCE
[06:46] <Seper> I can't say for sure, but that looks like it's about right.
[06:46] <homeskill> why doesnt alt or ctrl pgup scroll up in a gnome terminal?
[06:47] <Chaorain> k thanks
[06:47] <crdlb> homeskill: shift-pgup does
[06:47] <aprilhare> Seper: thanks for that
[06:48] <homeskill> crdlb it must be because im using screen(1) because its not working

[06:50] <Seper> Starcraftmazter: Channels 11+ are illegal in some countries. That might have something to do with it. i dunno
[06:51] <Starcraftmazter> Seper: is there any way to change this behaviour?

[06:58] <Witepa> I'm trying to write a command to replace an IP address in a file. I got sed to recognize what to replace, but I don't know how to tell it what to replace it with. The new IP address is defined in another stream/text file, how would I get sed to replace the old IP with the new IP using the substitute command?
[06:58] <Seper> CppIsWeird: That happened to me when my CPU was overheating
[06:58] <CppIsWeird> nvm, i disc
[06:59] <CppIsWeird> yeah seper, i JUST discovered that
[06:59] <CppIsWeird> looked in my clear case and a cable is blocking it

[06:59] <basanta> Seper, command
[07:00] <CppIsWeird> hope i didnt dammage the CPU, ubuntu keep a record anywhere by chance of cpu temps or max cpu temps?
[07:00] <Seper> basanta: Use pastebin.com to show us your output
[07:01] <Seper> Witepa: I've done that before, but it sounds like you're gonna need more than just sed

[07:02] <SkyNetMaster> hi, I run on thinkpad laptop and each time it has been off (suspended, hibernated etc) the brightness drops to half. and I have to restore them manually, how do I fix brightness permanently?
[07:03] <Seper> Witepa: You will need to feed the output of the file/stream into a variable. Then give that variable to sed.
[07:03] <Witepa> Seper: this is what I have: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/
[07:04] <Witepa> Seper: how would I use cat, echo's, and variables with that?
[07:04] <Seper> SkyNetMaster: Does this only happen when the system is suspend/hibernated, or also from cold boot?
[07:04] <nayten_> SkynetMaster just reminded me of an issue I've been having-- on my Dell Inspiron 600m laptop, when I change the brightness with function keys, the system changes the brightness but wont accept anymore keyboard input for the rest of the session. anyone familiar with this?

[07:06] <SkyNetMaster> nayten_, no, it works fine, I just need manually adjust brightness each time after logoff, which is annoying :)
[07:07] <Seper> Witepa: You need a command prior to that which puts the IP into a variable. Like so: $ cat IP.txt | read $var
[07:07] <nayten_> SkynetMaster: I was just pointing out my own issue as well, I realized I never found a solution.

[07:20] <Seper> ZachFlem: I would suggest trying to run from the LiveCD and test if it works ok with a regular setup.
[07:20] <rww> D00NGi4: disable compiz/desktop effects if you're using them, and set Option "TexturedVideo" "off" in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf's Device section. That worked for me (though I don't use HDMI).
[07:21] <tibrox> If I use 64bit ubuntu will there be packages which won't work on my new system?
[07:21] <D00NGi4> rww: compiz is disabled. When I put texturedvideo off in my xorg.conf, the X server crashes upon start

[07:36] <Seper> Prophetus: congrats
[07:37] <tyler_d> Witepa: you aren't reading anything into var, so its not going to output anything
[07:37] <tyler_d> Witepa: sorry just read the syntax of your command
[07:37] <Witepa> tyler_d: how do I read something into var?
[07:37] <tyler_d> type `var=foo`
[07:38] <D00NGi4> rww: Textured video definitely crashes system, hangs on boot
[07:38] <tyler_d> alternately type `echo var=foo >> ~/test.sh && chmod +x ~/test.sh`
[07:38] <tyler_d> Witepa: then `./test.sh`
[07:38] <Witepa> tyler_d: okay, how do I pipe a stream into a var though?
[07:39] <tyler_d> Witepa: sorry, define pipe a stream?
[07:39] <Seper> Witepa: This is how I originally used it in my previous trials, this works: $ cat txt | while read var; do echo $var; done
[07:40] <tyler_d> Witepa: that will work, as long as their is input for var it will echo it... as soon as there isn't it will quit
[07:40] <Witepa> tyler_d: why do I have to put it in a while loop though?
[07:40] <tyler_d> Witepa: because you are using that as your test condition
[07:40] <tyler_d> Witepa: what exactly are you trying to accomplish if I might inquire
[07:40] <Seper> Witepa: I'm trying to see if it can be done without a while loop
[07:40] <tyler_d> ??
[07:41] <Seper> tyler_d: He wants to put a file with one line into a variable.
[07:42] <Witepa> tyler_d: I want to put a file or stream with one line into a variable and then substitute that into another stream using sed
[07:42] <danielrulesyou> hello
[07:42] <tyler_d> Witepa: testing
[07:42] <_Xenu> var=$(cat file)
[07:43] <D00NGi4> does anyone know how to force my ALC888 sound driver or just ALSA/Pulse to output 24 bit SPDIF data? I think it's outputting 32bit data and my receiver can't handle that.
[07:43] <tyler_d> yup
[07:43] <Seper> _Xenu: bravo
[07:43] <tyler_d> _Xenu: has it
[07:43] <maxagaz> how to ckeck the free space on a hard drive in order to extend the size of a partition ? (in bash)
[07:43] <tyler_d> foo=$(cat foo) && echo $foo
[07:43] <tyler_d> maxagaz: df -hy
[07:43] <tyler_d> sorry maxagaz df -h
[07:44] <maxagaz> tyler_d: that works for a partition, not for a drive
[07:44] <tyler_d> maxagaz: gparted
[07:44]  * danielrulesyou yawns
[07:44] <Seper> Witepa: Yes, _Xenu solution will work
[07:44] <Seper> var=$(cat file)
[07:45] <Witepa> tyler_d, _Xenu, Seper: okay, that works. Now, how do I use that variable in sed? For example, sed 's/<replacethis>/$var'
[07:45] <tyler_d> you would simply do.....
[07:45] <[saat_koneksi_le> jfdjrdi
[07:45] <paulSterio> http://dpaste.com/5064/
[07:45] <_Xenu> use double quotes
[07:45] <_Xenu> substitution does not happen in single quotes
[07:45] <Tec1> кто работал со сквидом?
[07:45] <Seper> Witepa: Ya, ' to "
[07:45] <[saat_koneksi_le> hello?
[07:45] <paulSterio> does anyone know what the gcc rubbish is - I get this on my mac as well
[07:45] <[saat_koneksi_le> help me?
[07:45] <tyler_d> var=$(cat file) && sed -i 's/searchforthis/$var/g' file_to_mod
[07:46] <Witepa> Seper: it outputs the $var instead of its value though
[07:46] <[saat_koneksi_le> guide me to join a channel
[07:46] <[saat_koneksi_le> please?
[07:46] <tyler_d> [saat_koneksi_le: type /j #channel
[07:46] <Witepa> Seper: it outputs "$var" rather than var's value (to clarify)
[07:46] <paulSterio> what is gcc
[07:46] <Seper> Witepa: ' to "

[07:47] <paulSterio> _Xenu, where do I get that file
[07:47] <Seper> Witepa: double quotes are needed to recognize the variable. single quotes do not recognize variables

[07:47] <D00NGi4> sorry

[07:47] <Sake> yea the guys in comiz really helpful

[07:48] <[saat_koneksi_le> thx tyler
[07:48] <Sake> first of all, what is it?
[07:48] <tyler_d> np [saat_koneksi_le
[07:48] <Sake> :D
[07:48] <Witepa> Seper, _Xenu, tyler_d: It works! Thank you so much, the double quotes were the issue
[07:48] <Seper> Witepa: great
[07:49] <tyler_d> Witepa: ;)
[07:49] <tyler_d> Seper: for future reference, try checking #bash
[07:49] <tyler_d> good bunth of guys

[07:56] <Seper> TML: I would search google. A brief look through the manpage didn't seem to make it obvious.
[07:56] <Flannel> TML: You can hit ^a ^a to send a ^a to the interior program
[07:56] <operationhavok1> I need help with MUTT, I can't seem to get the IMAP set up :|

[07:57] <TML> Flannel: Thanks...I'll try that. I know how to map them in .screenrc, it's just 'while connected' that is giving me fits, when I can't seem to send meta to it to get ":escape ..."
[07:57] <TML> Seper: Nice. Thank you.
[07:57] <paulSterio> _Xenu, I don't know what to do.
[07:57] <Flannel> TML: ^a ^a should send ^a to the program
[07:57] <paulSterio> doe anyone know how I can work with l_renderPM_libart and get this stupid file implemented so reportlabs just friken installs
[07:58] <Flannel> oh, thats what you said you'd try.  right.

[08:00] <Flannel> operationhavok1: the mutt docs online cover it fairly well: http://mutt.sourceforge.net/imap/
[08:00] <Myrtti> dotblank: didn't it say it in the release notes
[08:00] <ZachFlem> does xfce have an equivalent to the "Hardware Drivers" app in gnome/ubuntu ???
[08:01] <Tech-desk> f
[08:01] <tyler_d> ZachFlem: #xubuntu
[08:01] <paulSterio> anyone know what l_renderPM_libart is for reportlab?
[08:02] <Seper> dotblank: Updates your system to the latest kernel release?

[08:05] <lolhate> Hello
[08:05] <lolhate> I just installed Ubuntu
[08:05] <lolhate> I need some helpp
[08:05] <lolhate> *help
[08:05] <paulSterio> tyler_d,  and I've installed the python-dev kit
[08:05] <Seper> ok
[08:05] <paulSterio> lolhate just ask your question
[08:05] <lolhate> when I try to install the graphics driver
[08:06] <lolhate> it says something about lock?
[08:06] <Madkiss_> hi folks.
[08:06] <lolhate> ah wait
[08:06] <lolhate> uhhh
[08:06] <lolhate> shit
[08:06] <FloodBot1> lolhate: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:06] <lolhate> sorry about that
[08:06] <Madkiss_> I am experiencing massive problems with latest nvidia-drivers in intrepid, basically, i can not start KDE because I see all different kinds of KDE applications crash with SIGSEV11
[08:06] <Madkiss_> is this a known problem and is a fix available for it?
[08:07] <dotblank> are you trying to install the nvidia driver using their installer while x is running?
[08:07] <Madkiss_> no, it's all packages stuff.
[08:07] <dotblank> just a guess
[08:07] <bobbie4_> I like the Ubuntu, Ubuntu is good on me
[08:07] <paulSterio> tyler_d, u got any idea how to fix that
[08:07] <Flannel> lolhate: You can only have one package manager open at a time.  So if you're say, doing upgrades, you can't be installing other stuff (which includes graphic drivers, etc)
[08:07] <tyler_d> paulSterio: apt-get install libc6-dev
[08:08] <crdlb> paulSterio: gcc is the compiler; just because it's failing does not mean it's failing for the same reason
[08:08] <balrog__> how do i setup intrepid to always connect to my bluetooth mouse upon bootup?  I can connect it using the wizard, but that doesn't stick after a reboot.
[08:08] <paulSterio> crdlb I am a total noob - so I have no idea why it's failing
[08:08] <lolhate> shit
[08:08] <tyler_d> paulSterio: do apt-get install libc6-dev and let me know after you try again
[08:08] <Flannel> lolhate: Also, please watch your language.
[08:08] <lolhate> I think I changed something from the system resolution
[08:08] <rww> Madkiss_: https://launchpad.net/+search?field.text=SIGSEV+kde+nvidia&field.actions.search=Search might be a good place to start. Looks like other people are having issues.
[08:08] <lolhate> and uh sorry
[08:08] <bobbie4_> I like the Ubuntu, Ubuntu is good on me
[08:08] <lolhate> and now when I click system
[08:08] <crdlb> paulSterio: dumb question, why don't you install python-reportlab from the repos?
[08:08] <lolhate> it opens up evolution
[08:08] <FloodBot1> lolhate: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:09] <Madkiss_> rww: thanks for the link
[08:09] <paulSterio> tyler_d,  system already has that installed
[08:09] <lolhate> And, um, I cant change my resolution now
[08:09] <lolhate> help?
[08:09] <paulSterio> crdlb tried that as well
[08:09] <paulSterio> gave the same problem
[08:10] <Gnea> !resolution | lolhate
[08:10] <ubottu> lolhate: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type « sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart » in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution
[08:10] <crdlb> paulSterio: no it didn't; installing python-reportlab doesn't require you to compile it
[08:10] <robd> Hey guys
[08:11] <tyler_d> paulSterio: cd to the source and tell me if there is a configure file in there
[08:11] <robd> Just wondering, is there an easy way to insert a new iptables rule in between existing rules w/o flushing and reloading everything?
[08:11] <tyler_d> paulSterio: your output would indicate something "non-standard" is going on
[08:11] <quibbler> balrog__: maybe this can help: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=594624
[08:12] <crdlb> paulSterio: what exactly is the error you get from sudo apt-get install python-reportlab ?
[08:12] <robd> ahh, never mind
[08:12] <robd> this actually looks easy
[08:14] <balrog__> quibbler: thanks.  i didnt think hidd was available in intrepid, but bash tells me its at least installable.
[08:14] <paulSterio> yup I'm a fucking moron. crdlb - you rock the party.... why does easy_install crash though?
[08:14] <tyler_d> paulSterio: because easy_install is good for breaking stuff
[08:14] <Flannel> paulSterio: Please mind the language.  Thanks.
[08:14] <lolhate> umm
[08:15] <paulSterio> tyler_d I wasted 2 days trying to break this and all I needed to do was grab it from the repo
[08:15] <lolhate> that link kinda screwed me up
[08:15] <paulSterio> that was RETARDED!
[08:15] <lolhate> I had to restart my computer

[08:20] <paulSterio> tyler_d,  ok I know this isn't ubuntu related - but I grabbed the repo from the site for my MAC, but I get this unable to execute gcc error again. Do you know if I need to get xcode for the mac?

[08:39] <error404notfound> I have a machine which I am making backup server. It has 120G+320G x 2. Its going to backup about 400G data. What should be the best scheme? I think 640G LVM (320x2) and 160 for ubuntu install. But 160 for a server install is way too large, isn't it?
[08:39] <ubottu> egycoder90: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)

[08:41] <tyler_d> ikonia: 8.10 will
[08:41] <error404notfound> ikonia: so from 160G, let 10G be "/" and rest would be empty
[08:41] <egycoder90> sorry 4 my english :(
[08:41] <suzao> ikonia: i remember a simple solution.. adding the extra resolutions in conf.. but now that doesnt seem to work any more.
[08:41] <ikonia> tyler_d: how does she get graphics without xorg ?
[08:42] <ikonia> error404notfound: thats all you need
[08:42] <tyler_d> ikonia: messed mine up at the office, thats how I reconfigured it... renamed it and bounced
[08:42] <ikonia> tyler_d: she's just asked how ubuntu will work WITH graphics without xorg - I said it won't
[08:43] <egycoder90> any body can help ?

[08:48] <vulinhpc> hihi
[08:49] <vulinhpc> how are you everybody ?
[08:49] <suzao> ikonia: is there any easy way to add 1280x1024? I dont really know how with 8.10 ... diddnt see any guides
[08:49] <ikonia> suzao: I've not been looking at your problem, check the nvidia drivers are enabled and that your xorg.conf is set to use them
[08:49] <egycoder90> ikonia : thanks 4 u rtime
[08:50] <timothy> I think I may have found a problem with network manager on jaunty
[08:50] <ikonia> timothy: then discuss in #ubuntu+1 and log a bug
[08:50] <timothy> thanks
[08:51] <timothy> didn't know where to ask about it
[08:52] <suzao> ikonia: the nvidia drivers are enabled.. but it says.. "a different version of this driver is in use" (presumably when i installed through the hardware manager it installed a newer driver from nvidia than it could detect."
[08:52] <Malacius> hi
[08:52] <ikonia> suzao: right so you've broke your install by installing nvidia drivers from nvidia.com
[08:52] <ikonia> suzao: why did you install kernel modules from nvidia.com ?
[08:53] <Malacius> hi ;-/
[08:53] <suzao> ikonia: i did not.. i just assume thats where ubuntu gets them from.
[08:53] <quibbler> !welcome | Malacius
[08:53] <ubottu> Malacius: Welcome to #ubuntu - the Ubuntu support channel.
[08:53] <Malacius> i know
[08:53] <suzao> ikonia: i used the hardware driver install feature on 8.10.. it isntalled the driver.. then my screen got upgraded from 800x600 to 1024x768 but i still dont see any option for 1280x1024
[08:54] <ikonia> suzao: I find it hard to accept that hardware manager has enabled 2 versions of the hardware drivers
[08:54] <ikonia> suzao: the only way two could be available is if you installed a package outside of the hardware drivers interface
[08:54] <Sake> Hey, anyone updated their linux kernel and got an error that required a rollback?
[08:54] <suzao> ikonia: I installed this 24 hours ago.. first time i thought it was hanging.. then.. it installed a second time.. it showed that it was installing.
[08:54] <ikonia> Sake: from what version to what version, and what error
[08:54] <suzao> ikonia: how can i make it right?
[08:55] <Sake> i went from v12 to 13 i386
[08:55] <ikonia> suzao: I'd remove all the nvidia drivers from the package mnger - reboot using the vesa driver
[08:55] <Sake> and had to use a youtube vid to fix ut
[08:55] <ikonia> suzao: exactly what versions please
[08:55] <ikonia> suzao: sorr - not you
[08:55] <ikonia> Sake: exactly which versions please
[08:55] <suzao> ikonia: where do i check versions?
[08:55] <Sake> 1 sec
[08:55] <suzao> ikonia: i clicked on activate. . now it says i need to reboot.
[08:55] <suzao> ikonia: download time was zero
[08:55] <ikonia> suzao: because they are already downloaded
[08:56] <suzao> ikonia: it seems to think it has the right drivers..
[08:56] <Sake> I forgot what the command was to show the lates one
[08:56] <Sake> how do I talk at someone?
[08:56] <suzao> how do i enable or revert to default after uninstalling nvidia?
[08:56] <ikonia> suzao: just show me "uname -a" please
[08:56] <Sake> ok

[09:03] <prince_jammys> no idea, but i assume that's what he meant
[09:04] <h_torque> yes, sorry, my punctuation sucks
[09:04] <ikonia> h_torque: guess it depends what you've done - as to how to fix it
[09:05] <fatih> hplaserjet1020 isn't printing solve?
[09:05] <h_torque> i just compiled the sources and installed it (i first installed it via the dev's PPA and it worked fine)
[09:05] <gate> ikonia: I could figure that output out myself
[09:05] <gate> thank you
[09:05] <gate> :-)
[09:06] <h_torque> thing is, vesafb is broken now and i have no idea what have been changed by installing plymouth manually
[09:06] <prince_jammys> h_torque: this Plymouth thing looks scary :)
[09:06] <prince_jammys> from the page you pasted
[09:06] <fatih> hplip3.9.2run was installed but not print
[09:07] <gate> ikonia: what does the uname -m mean? Is it what the kernel is compiled for?
[09:07] <ikonia> h_torque: at what point do you try to start plymouth, and how
[09:07] <h_torque> just another try to be more bling bling :D
[09:07] <ikonia> gate: it shows the arch
[09:07] <gate> i686
[09:07] <gate> 32 bit
[09:08] <h_torque> ikonia: right now i don't want to start plymouth, i totally removed all installed files, recreated the ramdisk and now only want my vesafb back
[09:09] <ikonia> h_torque: how you start/set it up can maybe help determain what you've done and how to undo it
[09:09] <ikonia> h_torque: that's why I'm asking
[09:10] <h_torque> i just did the usual ./configure, make, make install - the settings in the makefile looked fine
[09:10] <armedking> is there any way i can make an archive or some bogus file and fill it with useless data?

[09:13] <prince_jammys> h_torque: i'd still try that

[09:13] <ikonia> leonardo: I'm not looking
[09:14] <krishnan> ikonia: but the server on which i hosted the website is not viewable
[09:14] <leonardo> may I send you the page in private, just to test it please
[09:14] <ikonia> krishnan: probably because your port forwarding is no setup on your new router
[09:14] <ikonia> leonardo: no thanks
[09:14] <max82fr> Can anyone help me please?
[09:15] <h_torque> ikonia: i didn't manually configure it so i guess it used the standard configuration. it's my own fault i know... the wiki page clearly states that plymouth is highly integrated in the distribution and nothing you just compile and install. anyways, it's just a testing machine.
[09:15] <ikonia> h_torque: crash and burn it then
[09:15] <krishnan> ikonia: it is setup
[09:15] <ZachFlem> how can i find out what version of the kernel i have installed?
[09:15] <ikonia> krishnan: well it must be setup to point to the old 192 address

[09:28] <Prima_zz> ?????
[09:28] <Prima_zz> ?? ???? ?
[09:28] <CppIsWeird> when trying to copy files to an ntfs hard disk i get "Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character" From what I have been able to gather from my research is that this is a result of ntfs having some issue with supporting locales properly or something. This data came from a windows drive, so I know ntfs can support these files names. How can i get linux to copy these files properly?
[09:28] <ikonia> Frantic: so ?

[09:28] <ziroday> mejobloggs: you need to add your cd as a repo in /etc/apt/sources.list

[09:29] <sdf2> are there any guide how to make it work? Cause i'M having weird things in it...
[09:29] <ikonia> Frantic: it's a fake raid board, which is why it's not supported on linux

[09:53] <KazaLite> hi all....im new to ubuntu and migrating from windows.....i needed wireshark in ubuntu so i run apt-get install wireshark....everything went fine and wireshark is installed. now when i launch wireshark, it does not show any network intrerface on my computer ..... :(
[09:53] <rww> KazaLite: try gksudo wireshark
[09:54] <exon> hello got a mail question  my freind try to mail with evolution ....he can recieve  mails but not send his pc is a dual boot system and under windows everything works fine .....i used his identity and password login etc exactly same  as he did and here no problems .......if he tries to send mail  it says host not found ...could there be a port locked and how can i check it  and open it .....i did a standard  ubuntu install on his pc
[09:55] <ActionParsnip> exon: get him to check smtp settings
[09:55] <exon> i did
[09:55] <KazaLite> i see .... so i need to be root to run and use all features of wireshark
=== Ish is now known as ish2
[09:55] <ActionParsnip> exon: what email provider does s/he use?
[09:55] <exon> skynet
[09:55] <rww> KazaLite: yeah. It needs administrative privilages to attach to interfaces
[09:56] <exon> relay.skynet.be
[09:56] <KazaLite> cool
[09:56] <KazaLite> but gksudo sucks.......simply using sudo wireshark makes it work
[09:57] <exon> i also have a skynet provider  and i checked it and its ok
[09:57] <ActionParsnip> exon: is his outgooing server: relay.skynet.be
[09:57] <rww> !gksudo | KazaLite
[09:57] <ubottu> KazaLite: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
[09:57] <exon> yes
[09:58] <KazaLite> oh i see
[09:59] <ActionParsnip> exon: can he run: telnet relay.skynet.be 25
[09:59] <ActionParsnip> exon: if he gets connected tell him to type HELO and hit enter (NOT HELLO)
[10:00] <ActionParsnip> exon: http://www.sky.net.uk/support/helpyourself.php?id=4
[10:01] <ActionParsnip> exon: smtp.skynet.co.uk (outgoing)
[10:01] <ActionParsnip> try that
[10:01] <KazaLite> onething.....gksudo sucks if i run wireshark......but kdesu makes wireshark run nicely
[10:01] <ActionParsnip> KazaLite: are you running kde or gnome?
[10:02] <error404notfound> for a backup partition which filesystem is better? xfs or reiserfs? backup contains a mix of large files such as iso, .tar.gz and small files like oo.o or even plain text files..
[10:02] <exon> but i have also a skynet connection   and on my other  pc i filled in his  login password etc  and here it works fine
[10:02] <KazaLite> but did not know earlier that we need to be careful when running graphical applications
[10:02] <KazaLite> do not know:( i just installed ubuntu....do not know whether it is kde or gnome
[10:02] <ActionParsnip> KazaLite: well yeah, you need to be careful with any app running with sudo /kdesudo
[10:02] <Myrtti> KazaLite: is your ubuntu "brown" or "blue"?
[10:03] <travian_geek> Is there an iptable command to list all chain names??????
[10:03] <KazaLite> hehehe.........brown:P
[10:03] <ActionParsnip> exon: you could export your account setting to a file to have him import it, then  simply mofify the username and password

[10:03] <Myrtti> KazaLite: then you're on gnome :-)
[10:04] <neil_d> how can I find out what module was loaded to access eth0?
[10:04] <ActionParsnip> exon: if he can connect to the mail server with telnet then you security shouldnt be an issue
[10:04] <KazaLite> but why for wireshark gksudo sucks and kdesu works for me
[10:04] <sprinkmeier_> error404notfound, disk is cheap. I'd go xfs (mostly because I've used it a little and am comfortable with it). ext4?

[10:27] <max82fr> u didn t respond to my question?
[10:27] <mib_semslie> Any idea how I can regenerate that config file?
[10:27] <sdf2> cooldduuudde: i typed in compiz into the search

[10:27] <ubottu> Package ccsm does not exist in intrepid
[10:27] <cooldduuudde> sdf2: did you get 6 results?
[10:27] <Frantic> ActionParsnip: I have seen those but didn't help, my problem is that grub doesn't recognize my boot partition which is a ext3 fs on a raid1 volume
[10:27] <sdf2> cooldduuudde: i only get 1 result

[10:28] <sonium> I just did "mv somefile ~/. " where is it now?
[10:28] <mib_semslie> I was thinking I could either purge whichever package owns that config file and install it, or just upgrade to jaunty :)
