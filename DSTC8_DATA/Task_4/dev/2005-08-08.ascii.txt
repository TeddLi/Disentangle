[11:29] <dave> hello
[11:29] <dave> new to linux just trying
[11:29] <CircleofChaos> ChynphaT,  have you asked that question in #KUBUNTU?
[11:29] <topyli> aceb747: enable the marillat unstable repository temporarily and install w32codecs. then disable the repo again
[11:29] <ChynphaT> oh, no, thanks ill go do that
[11:30] <Subliminal> mcphail: it printed pictures at me
[11:30] <thoreauputic> CircleofChaos: are you sure the ops in #perl didn't silence you? maybe /msg a #perl op or something
[11:30] <Subliminal> mcphail: ahh, it told me [ctrl-j]  was an invalid argument :-/
[11:31] <mcphail> Subliminal: try 'return' instead
[11:31] <Razor-X> is my system really too slow for H.264 ?

[11:31] <ubotu> I heard ! is what u add before a sentence to talk to me
[11:31] <aceb747> topyli, it is saying there is no installation canidate
[11:31] <CircleofChaos> I did, but then I dropped the nickname.
[11:31] <CircleofChaos> It was useless to talk in #perl when no one listened.
[11:31] <Gorth> when i try to access my shared folder over a network, it asks for a user, so i made a user "guest"
[11:32] <Subliminal> mcphail: as in press enter?
[11:32] <Gorth> and set a folder to 777
[11:32] <Gorth> and it says unknown username!
[11:32] <topyli> aceb747: are sure you ran "apt-get update"?
[11:32] <thoreauputic> CircleofChaos: well, this isn't magic -if you change your nick you are no longer recognised
[11:32] <CircleofChaos> Gorth, are you using Samba?
[11:32] <Gorth> yeah
[11:32] <aceb747> topli, yes
[11:32] <Gorth> circleofchaos: yeah
[11:32] <mcphail> Subliminal:  yes. Sometimes when the terminal screws up enter doesn't work and you have to type ctrl-J instead

=== highvolt1ge is now known as highvoltage
[11:35] <topyli> aceb747: debian doesn't have the codecs for sure
[11:35] <dbernar1> CircleofChaos: so you can use that instead of interrupting everyones conversation
[11:35] <thoreauputic> CircleofChaos: in many channels that would have been an automatic kick
[11:35] <Subliminal> when i start gaim it tells me my version is out of date, but apt tells me my packages are all up to date, how can i upgrade gaim?
[11:35] <aceb747> topyli, it is also wierd that there not in the ubuntu repo when they say it is in the wiki
[11:35] <dbernar1> CircleofChaos: ya, so be careful, and dont paste like that.
[11:35] <CircleofChaos> Thoreauputic, why?
[11:36] <topyli> aceb747: just get the package from ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/pool/main/w/w32codecs/ :)

[11:50] <ixion> basically, the reason I am asking these krb5 questions is, hi, I have installed a samba server and used winbind to integrate with AD users, this works fine for people on domain member computers using windows. When I use linux to try and connect to the samba share I cant authenticate, any ideas what syntax I am supposed to use for the username? eg user@domain.com etc
[11:50] <rikva> !info universe
[11:50] <Seveas> ixion, try \\domain\user
[11:50] <stevenj> dbernar1, no I just got in from work and went to ubunu.com and then gnome-look and so I though google was down haha
[11:50] <MartenH> Seveas, will that add it to startup or just launch it for now?
[11:50] <dbernar1> rikva: ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components

[11:51] <rikva> Seveas: I use debian on my workstation, it can also use different repositories... I want to give kubuntu a try because i want up2date packages
[11:51] <stevenj> dbernar1, sure thanks

[11:51] <rikva> dbernar1: thanks
[11:51] <ixion> I've installed krb5, and winbind - does anyone know where I confgure winbind to join a domain and edit the krb5 options?
[11:51] <dbernar1> just a sec

[11:55] <aceb747> cefx, what is your experience of running the amd64 version.  is ia64 any better?

[11:55] <HakonBH> algum do brasil?
[11:55] <cefx> Are you going to do a lot of multimedia?
[11:55] <cefx> use i386 if so
[11:55] <cefx> it's less heartache

[12:16] <balistic2> thank you ace
[12:16] <balistic2> can i install ubuntu using floppy disks
[12:16] <ubuntu_> is the a way i can enable vnc without going to System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop
[12:17] <errr_> where are the local startup scripts?
[12:17] <MartenH> nox, how do I do that? doesn't it come with xawtv?
[12:17] <ubuntu_> as in thru a terminal
[12:17] <Amaranth> balistic2: I do not believe floppy installation is possible.
[12:17] <aceb747> balistic2: i think u can only do it cdrom
[12:17] <balistic2> amaranth, i saw some where it said that you can install debian first
[12:17] <balistic2> and then install ubuntu
[12:17] <balistic2> is that logical?
[12:17] <nox> MartenH, i have no idea - install libpt-plugins-v4l2
[12:17] <Amaranth> balistic2: If you don't mind never getting help from us, sure. :)
[12:18] <aceb747> balistic2: yes that is possible i think
[12:18] <cefx> Anyone ever install Cedega?
[12:18] <Amaranth> balistic2: that is really more likely to break your system
[12:18] <errr_> On gentoo they are:  /etc/conf.d/local.start  but I am unable to find the ubuntu one
[12:18] <ubuntu_> is there access to vnc seting thru bash?
[12:18] <balistic2> brb
[12:18] <ubuntu_> to turn it off/on
[12:18] <Amaranth> balistic2: some things in debian 3.1 are newer than ubuntu 5.04
[12:18] <cefx> Has anyone ever installed Cedega and knows what I have to do?
[12:18] <aceb747> you would do a debian ne install and a dist-upgrade to ubuntu

[12:34] <LinuxJones> MartenH, is there a netinstall using a floppy disk ?
[12:34] <MartenH> balistic2, don't know just that it can be done. ANother suggestion is to get a small non-GUI distribution on there and then download a real one to the HD and install it form there

[12:41] <nox> mark__: why don`t you do it with cfdisk? it is realy good..
[12:41] <Sputn1k> where is lilo config file?
[12:41] <chrischio> ^
[12:41] <balistic2> how do i netinstall debian
[12:41] <balistic2> using floppy
[12:41] <f_newton> lilo?
[12:41] <mark__> nox, what command do i need to issue? i dont wanna screw anything up
[12:41] <f_newton> lordy probably at mandriva
[12:41] <vader1102> yes, f_newton
[12:41] <nox> mark__: there is a thousands of way to do it. i think that this is the best way
[12:41] <thoreauputic> Sputn1k: ubuntu uses the grub bootloader
[12:41] <nox> mark__: sudo apt-get install cfdisk
[12:41] <kemik> balistic2:  tried google? or debian.org ?
[12:41] <f_newton> vader1102, good to know
[12:41] <vader1102> everything I have seen and read
[12:41] <shammy> f_newton: so that means I do not need ndiswrapper?
[12:42] <nox> mark__: and then just write cfdisk, its all CLI
[12:42] <kemik> balistic2:  or #debian ?
[12:42] <f_newton> well if you are using a netgear card or similar with intersil prism2 driver no you dont shammy
[12:42] <Sputn1k> thoreauputic: i know, but where is lilo fonfig?
[12:42] <vader1102> shammy: go to that site I gave you earlier, and look
[12:42] <chrischio> kemik?
[12:42] <shammy> vader1102: where can I find madwifi? It's not under net apps or system tools
[12:42] <f_newton> not the 2.5 driver now....
[12:42] <nox> MartenH, ok, give me the link to the site, and your cpu type
[12:42] <shammy> vader1102: my adapter isn't on that list, no
[12:43] <thoreauputic> Sputn1k: the config file for grub is in /boot/grub/   if you want lilo you need to install it and use /etc/lilo.conf if I remember correctly
[12:43] <vader1102> then I would use ndiswrapper
[12:43] <vader1102> there may be other ones but do not know

[12:52] <thoreauputic> mcquillg: iptables, and not really as there are no "open" ports since there are no services running by default

Yet now that I've removed most of my Ubuntu packages, and reinstalled ubuntu-base, it no longer works.  I'm not entirely certain how to compile it correctly.  I've been trying by myself all afternoon.

[01:07] <Raf99> tim - from my understanding you need a wired to start the install.
[01:07] <rajiv_> I think its Gurb
[01:07] <thoreauputic> sudo lilo -v is "verbose" and helps if you made an error

[01:07] <johnstock> f_newton: can you help me for broadcom wlan?
[01:07] <jasoncohen> f_newton, grub is used on i386 and amd64 i think
[01:07] <f_newton> lilo is limited and obsolete
[01:07] <yhager> f_newton: yes, it's grub, but ubuntu_ is pretty sure he is using lilo.. :)
[01:08] <jasoncohen> f_newton, lilo is used on ppc i believe and i know it's used on LVM root partitions
[01:08] <bimberi> tim: if your wireless k/b works for the bios - ie. to manipulate the setup menu - then there's a good chance it will work for the install
[01:08] <jasoncohen> grub can't boot off LVM
[01:08] <MartenH> thoreauputic, it tells me it can't lock /var/lib/dpkg (and btw, uname should be uname or my username?)

[01:12] <f_newton> stevenj 1.01 is old
[01:12] <Nevado> jasoncohen, when I do that it says "Could not add application to the application database"
[01:13] <stevenj> yes but thats the "official" ubuntu version
[01:13] <MartenH> thoreauputic, I figured that out on my own :) But thanks, it's always nice to know what I'm doing and not just follow blindly
[01:13] <stevenj> so now I use backports and it works again
[01:13] <CircleofChaos> Is there a channel I can go to, to ask computer hardware questions or can I ask it here?
[01:13] <Nevado> jasoncohen, works fine for any other apps... however mine is called "VLC for GNOME" rather than "VLC media player"
[01:13] <thoreauputic> MartenH: cool :) And yes, that's why I mentioned it
[01:13] <CircleofChaos> May I?
=== Will_ [9010@quake.swe.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[01:13] <MartenH> thoreauputic, I guess I need gcc to. will that package suffice or should I get any of the multitude of other gcc packages avaliabe
=== linlin [~linlin@c-67-184-161-83.hsd1.il.comcast.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[01:13] <jasoncohen> Nevado, so, what happens when you choose "vLC for gnome"?
[01:14] <thoreauputic> MartenH: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[01:14] <direwolf> i was getting an error with the backports all day. I forget what the mirror is..its on forums somewhere
[01:14] <chrischio> hm...
[01:14] <Nevado> jasoncohen, it comes up with that error (could not add application to application database)
[01:14] <stevenj> maybe it was just me...but that was my solution...for whats it worth :) now I eat. :)
[01:14] <MartenH> thoreauputic, ah ok, ty
[01:14] <linlin> Has anyone ever used CrossoverOffice on ubuntu?
[01:14] <linlin> I cant get it to work :(
[01:14] <f_newton> stevenj mine says ver1.06 and its the one that came with the install
[01:14] <thoreauputic> MartenH: apt-cache show build-essential for info :)
[01:14] <chrischio> i downloaded, ./configured, maked and make installed pure-ftpd  ...  and now? how to start it???
[01:15] <stevenj> f_newton, hmm

[01:16] <Nevado> jasoncohen, yeah VLC works fine, just GNOME won't associate it with filetypes so I have to keep running it from the commandline... biut annoying
=== bimberi_ [~bimberi@DC-245-162.bpb.bigpond.com]  has joined #ubuntu
[01:16] <jasoncohen> Nevado, actually it shows up as "VLC for Gtk+"
[01:16] <DrFalken> i'm having trouble running my .xsession file
[01:16] <balistic2> can i install ubuntu using network boot
[01:16] <CircleofChaos> Is it possible to use a 115V Computer in Europe?
[01:16] <deprave> what package is gstreamer-interfaces in?
[01:16] <DrFalken> i'm using gdm from login
[01:16] <Nevado> jasoncohen, I have that too... same error... I'll try removing the "vlc-gnome" package and see if that helps
[01:16] <bimberi_> bah - modem dropped out
[01:16] <CircleofChaos> What will I need to make it happen?
[01:17] <stevenj> f_newton, strange because 1.0.3 is the newest
[01:17] <jasoncohen> Nevado, that is weird
[01:17] <linlin> Has anyone ever used CrossoverOffice on ubuntu?
[01:17] <chrischio> linlin - nothing there..
=== raDeon_is_dead is now known as swazo
[01:17] <jasoncohen> Nevado, i'm getting the same things here now
[01:17] <thoreauputic> MartenH: for more info than you ever dreamed of, sudo apt-get install apt-howto-en ; then run apt-howto froma terminal ! ;-)
[01:17] <stevenj> f_newton, what does help --> about say?
[01:17] <Agamotto> CircleofChaos:  Usually, yes.  Flip the little switch on the back of the power supply, then plug in a lead with the right end bits.
[01:17] <Nevado> jasoncohen, did it work for you before? :\
[01:17] <deprave> what package is gstreamer-interfaces in?
[01:17] <linlin> chris try jsut ftpd start in a console
[01:17] <linlin> or proftpd start
[01:17] <linlin> etc etc
[01:17] <f_newton> ver 1.06
[01:18] <chrischio> pure ftpd^
[01:18] <thoreauputic> MartenH: or the equivalent package for your language of course...
[01:18] <linlin> you get the idea
[01:18] <f_newton> stevenj this is not my first rodeo
[01:18] <bimberi_> CircleofChaos: Depends.  Some h/w (eg. laptop power supplies) have dual-voltage.  Some don't even need a switch and are auto-sensing.
=== Will_ [9010@quake.swe.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[01:18] <stevenj> f_newton, well where does that version come from I wonder....its not versioned like that on the FS site
[01:18] <CircleofChaos> Agamotto, where do I get the correct power cable to use in Europe?
[01:18] <CircleofChaos> Does newegg sell it?
[01:19] <jasoncohen> Nevado, just add custom application "vlc"
[01:19] <jasoncohen> that works
[01:19] <DrFalken> i'm having trouble running my .xsession file... it isn't loaded when i login in GDM...
[01:19] <Agamotto> CircleofChaos:  Try an online store such as cyberguys or ipower.  They should have the correct leads
[01:19] <Nevado> jasoncohen, typed in rather than selected?
[01:19] <f_newton> stevenj  its the latest version of firefox ok? it probably updated on installation of ubuntu
[01:19] <MartenH> thoreauputic, ok :)

[01:22] <thoreauputic> MartenH: are you following a howto?
[01:22] <MartenH> thoreauputic, darn. ok well I'll try another version and hopefully it won't have those errors
