<s> you can also try and just type the full path to the ubuntu version , DIR/usr/ DIR/bin/ DIR/python3/ and then " import bz2 " should work just fine . </s>
<s> if that works you can rename DIR/usr/ DIR/local/ DIR/bin/ DIR/python3/ to DIR/usr/ DIR/local/ DIR/bin/ <unk#a./> and if needed , symlink DIR/usr/ DIR/local/ DIR/bin/ DIR/python3/ to DIR/usr/ DIR/bin/ DIR/python3/ .. or uninstall the package if you're lucky enough to have it coming from a package . </s>

<s> <user> k </s>
<s> <user> : no , if you do n't use a package , it 's a pain in the butt to get it all removed . maybe you can just do " mv DIR/usr/ DIR/local/ DIR/bin/ DIR/python3/ DIR/usr/ DIR/local/ DIR/bin/ <unk#a./> " </s>
