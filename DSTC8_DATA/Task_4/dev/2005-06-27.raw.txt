[10:40] <ekCo> ok
[10:40] <karlheg> ekCo, mount the new / on /mnt, mkdir in there for other mount points, mount them all up.

[11:08] <karlheg> r2d4, Ok.  We determined that you don't need 'sudo' for that... as long as you are in the 'audio' group.  What does 'id | grep audio' print?  Anything, or nothing?
[11:08] <tiglionabbit> rbrenart: in any "open" dialog, you can pin things to it
[11:08] <HiddenWolf> karlheg, teamspeak is not in the archive. it's semi-commercial
[11:08] <karlheg> What are your sound and multimedia settings from the panel menu System --> Preferences ?
[11:08] <r2d4> id | grep audio       prints nothing

[11:09] <ThE__OnE> how can i change the color of the windows?
[11:09] <ThE__OnE> i checked out windows and theme in preferences

[11:09] <poningru> karlheg: can you explain what dependencies cannot be handled by apt or something similar?
[11:10] <ekCo> karlheg, does nvclock work for you with latest ubuntu-nvidia drivers?
[11:10] <karlheg> When you create a new desktop user, make sure to use the "Desktop" profile so they have access to audio, CD, etc.

[11:10] <karlheg> ThE__OnE, What windows are you referring to?
[11:10] <r2d4> karlheg: It says I am already a member of audio
[11:11] <karlheg> poningru, apt is what handles depends.  'dpkg' alone does not.  'apt' takes a package name, not a .deb file.  'dpkg' takes a .deb file; apt runs it for you.
[11:11] <ThE__OnE> you know the color aroung applications and places and systems, how can i change that?
[11:11] <karlheg> A double click on a .deb would mean to run 'dpkg'.

[12:06] <lukus001> bob2: that site isnt in english :s lol
[12:06] <xabbu|> ubuntu, You need the have a ssh server installed on windows if you are to use ssh.
[12:06] <microhaxo> bah
[12:06] <Hylas> because I've got xmms and mplayer here as rpm's and I was going to convert them to deb with alien then install them. I have a slow internet connection so i try to stay away from downloading
[12:06] <nubbe> bob2, I could read some files with xp, but not with ubuntu, that I need...
[12:06] <microhaxo> If linux could actually run a damn game, CEDEGA is complete BS, wont run Counterstrike source whatso ever..
[12:07] <bob2> CDK: you can't, in general.  "make uninstall" might work if yo ustill have the original source tree still
[12:07] <bob2> microhaxo: so, if you're a paying customer, go to their site and vote for it
[12:07] <CDK> i c
[12:07] <bob2> Hylas: I'd strongly recommend not doing that
[12:07] <Hylas> ok
[12:07] <microhaxo> it is "Supported"
[12:07] <nubbe> bob2, and I know th aprtition is flaky, so I guess win handles the errors better
[12:07] <GNULinuxer> nubbe> what  files?
[12:07] <bob2> CDK: in future, checkinstall and stow are useful for that
[12:07] <bob2> microhaxo: then file a bug with them if it doesn't work
[12:07] <microhaxo> but just my luck it wont run on my sys

[12:24] <odie5533> Using Telnet to a website, what command downloads the page?
[12:24] <floo> can anyone help me with a problem?  I keep getting "temporary failure in name resolution"  I can ping ip addrsses and the router but no domains.  I've checked resolv.conf and everything's ok there similarly with /etc/hosts... aaarrgghh!!! any ideas?
[12:24] <bob2> odie5533: GET
[12:25] <bob2> floo: can you ping the nameserves in /etc/resov.conf?
[12:25] <odie5533> GET what?
[12:25] <odie5533> just "GET"
[12:25] <microhaxo> thats the command
[12:25] <floo> yes no probs there
[12:25] <bob2> GET $path HTTP/1.1
[12:25] <bob2> or just ues the GET command from libwww-perl
[12:25] <bob2> or wget
[12:25] <bob2> or ...
[12:25] <Triffid_Hunter> you need HOST too if you specify HTTP/1.1
[12:26] <bob2> hmm, right
[12:26] <microhaxo> the only reason why i dont like linux is: i spent lots of money on my nifty RADEON X800XT PE and linux cant do anything with it.
[12:26] <floo> ok I'll give that a go, thanks
[12:26] <Triffid_Hunter> that's ATI's fault, not linux's
[12:26] <odie5533> microhaxo: ebay
[12:26] <microhaxo> bah
[12:26] <microhaxo> no i am a GAMER
[12:26] <odie5533> sell it, and buy a real card, an nvidia

[12:26] <microhaxo> BAH
[12:27] <microhaxo> nvidia sucks ass

[12:27] <microhaxo> i can own any of you in a 3dmark 05 benchmark
[12:27] <Triffid_Hunter> yeah my fx5200 works just fine in linux ;)
