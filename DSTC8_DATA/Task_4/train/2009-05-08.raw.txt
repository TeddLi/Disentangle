[04:59] <jimisrvrox> Cryptic_Donkey: well if I was technically sound with *nix im sure I could figure a way out to make ends meet...I was thinking about hacking through an arch system until I got one done but I do not have net access on that machine as of now to download packages necessary so I had to halt that
[04:59] <n2diy> jasonmchristos: mondo might do what you want?
[04:59] <fryguy> jasonmchristos: as far as I know that isn't doable.  Best case would be to use disk backup/recovery software like dd.

[04:59] <tonsofpcs> video as .mts, cool
[04:59] <billybigrigger> tonsofpcs, am i sol with .mts video? its a sony format or what?
[04:59] <vimpulse> mib_uasgme4u:  yes.  But first please change your nickname.  See www.irchelp.com for how
[05:00] <mi1> vimpulse, one last thing, how can i remount back to  normal mount option if in case i give up(not wanting to recover in the end)
[05:00] <billybigrigger> tonsofpcs, what apps do you use in ubuntu? im in gnome
[05:00] <vimpulse> mi1:  just reboot, and it will be back.
[05:00] <jasonmchristos> n2diy: brb i am going to look up mondo
[05:00] <owen1> is there tweetdeck but as a website?
[05:00] <mi1> vimpulse,i mean the mount optioin we set earlier
[05:00] <vimpulse> mi1:  rebooting will reset it to rw.
[05:00] <Cryptic_Donkey> jimisrvrox: I have an old dell dimension 4600 i would be willing to part with for 150 bucks
[05:00] <mi1> okie vimpulse
[05:00] <mi1> thanks
[05:01] <vimpulse> jimisrvrox:  may i ask, what city do you live in?

[05:03] <billybigrigger> tonsofpcs, well none i guess, i just wanted to know of some decent apps i could edit or play around with my videos, this is my first videocam and im just lookin to play around...
[05:03] <mib_uasgme4u> ok hi I think i have a nickname now...
[05:03] <fryguy> Loganhoup: look on google/launchpad for known issues with your sound card and see if workarounds have been discovered, or go out and spend $20 on a new sound card that is known to work.
[05:03] <mzz> Loganhoup: I don't have the time right now to actually troubleshoot, but try to figure out what exactly is crashing (it may be pulseaudio instead of the actual drivers)
[05:03] <Strav> tonsofpcs: not bad ain't flawless. it made me swear a lot of times.
[05:03] <billybigrigger> tonsofpcs, i dont know if this is vlc or what but it seems like the video is really interlaced
[05:03] <fryguy> billybigrigger: so try playback in a different player
[05:03] <tonsofpcs> yes, video tends to be interlaced.
[05:03] <tonsofpcs> fryguy: the video is interlaced
[05:03] <mzz> Loganhoup: if it's a driver-level problem I'd expect to see debug noise in dmesg
[05:03] <mjm52> does anyone know of a good program to send mp3s to my Playstation 3????
[05:03] <jimisrvrox> Cryptic_Donkey: right now man that sounds great but like I said I cant be in the market...I have GX240's to work with...and unfortuantely am the only one working right now...so...im SOL
[05:03] <tonsofpcs> plying it somewhere else wont deinterlace it
[05:03] <tonsofpcs> running it through a deinterlace filter [vlc has like 10 to choose from] will

[05:05] <fryguy> tonsofpcs: yes
[05:05] <ketch1> Strav, thank you.  What next?
[05:05] <mzz> danielqb: that's more likely to be the sensors chip wired up strangely on the mobo than actual hardware problems

[05:06] <lstarnes> mib_uasgme4u: you have one (mib_uasgme4u)
[05:06] <tonsofpcs> lumiera is looking quite promising but it isn't anywhere near usable for playing around yet
[05:06] <lstarnes> mib_uasgme4u: you can change your nick using /nick new-nickname. for example, /nick foobar
[05:06] <fryguy> Loganhoup: so then share with us some more information, like what sound card you have, what driver is being used, if you've tried any of the workarounds you've found, if there are any error messages, what happens when you try to playback using a cli client, what, if anything is in /var/log/* that hints at the issue, what version of ubuntu you are running
[05:06] <Strav> ketch1: it could help a little if you don't have any spaces of special chars in the network's name.

[05:08] <Ryanman> no sounds like that in vista
[05:08] <mzz> Ryanman: check dmesg, consider running smartctl -a on the drive
[05:08] <Ryanman> also, it's pretty much brand new
[05:08] <luddite> my laptop is a acer aspire - 4315 - running 9.04. the fan is always on full - i cant find any idle controls and ive searched google  to no avail
[05:08] <fryguy> Ryanman: so?
[05:08] <Ryanman> kk lemee check that out. boots slower than vista right now too... I thought a corrupt partition or something
[05:08] <fryguy> Ryanman: vista lives on a different part of the hard drive, and the most common time for a hard drive to fail is within it's first week or 2 of operation
[05:09] <bullgard4> lstarnes: Where can I find the "settings" in Ubuntu 9.04 which you spoke about?

[05:17] <eduar> hi

[05:17] <ichik1> hola eduar
[05:17] <ichik1> :)
[05:18] <fryguy> Strav: iwconfig will show the equivalent of a wired connection when you are communicating with an AP

[05:18] <ichik1> hi klm
[05:18] <eduar> espanol?
[05:18] <Trenter_> how do i kill it, you are correct thats what it is
[05:18] <ichik1> claro!
[05:18] <mzz> Trenter_: I'd expect an emulator to use most of the cpu while it's running and none of it while it's not
[05:18] <cloud-nist> Is pidgin really being replaced in a future Ubuntu release?
[05:18] <Trenter_> the thing is, its gui isnt running
[05:18] <Suhail> what's the difference between hardy and intrepid?
[05:18] <Strav> fryguy: agreed, but I doubt he only wants layer1 or 2.
[05:18] <ichik1> does anybody know about the memory stick issue in jaunty?
[05:19] <fryguy> Strav: i'm sure he doesn't, but he probably wants to check to make sure things are working correctly before bothering with dhclient.
[05:19] <mzz> Trenter_: then that sounds like an fceu bug or misfeature. Does cpu load drop if you exit the emulator completely?
[05:19] <Strav> but the point will be made, his wireless works fine.
[05:19] <h00k> ichik1, you're probably going to have to be more specific
[05:19] <fryguy> Strav: there's lots of reasons why dhclient would fail, this will help to isolate issues better
[05:19]  * mzz wonders if there's a factoid for "the <insert random term here> issue"
[05:19] <cloud-nist> ichik1: Have you tried to reboot while the USB drive is conx to your USB port and see if it shows up?
[05:19] <Strav> fryguy: although dhclient can give some advices.
[05:19] <mzz> because asking about "the <insert random term here> issue" never works
[05:19] <Trenter_> mzz: yeah, but I think the error is occuring if the emulator freezes and I have to force quit it, sometimes roms freeze
[05:20] <fryguy> Strav: nothing that is applicable to wireless connections
[05:20] <ichik1> I have a dell inspiron 6400 with a ricoh card reader, which reads SD cards ok, but it wouldn't recognize (on fdisk) MS from sony
[05:20] <dmp1ce> Can anyone help me with a wireless connection issue?  I'm trying to connect with WPA and but the connection manager keeps asking for the password again.
[05:20] <mzz> Trenter_: that sounds like your force quit never actually kills the emulator, just the frontend, and killing the emulator in process monitor would fix it
[05:20] <fryguy> dmp1ce: try using wicd instead of networkmanager
[05:20] <h00k> ichik1, after you plug it in, try 'dmesg' from a terminal and see what it says at the end

[05:21] <RichiV> how do i find out what audio driver i am using... I want to install it
[05:21] <Strav> fryguy: in some point yes, he'll see if it's trying an authentification and such. I'm curious though, how would iwconfig give him some debug info?
[05:21] <eduar> ah shit u get me
[05:21] <bullgard4> lstarnes: This opens a dialog window called 'Edit Dictionary Source' and shows the following settings: Description='Default Dictionary Server', Transport='DictionaryServer', Hostname=dict.org, Port=2628.

[05:22] <lstarnes> bullgard4: that means that it uses the dictionary server protocol
[05:22] <RichiV> lol dont swear in here? some of us think its profane?
[05:22] <Trenter_> mzz: yeah worked, apparently when you force quit the graphical window it does not quit the backend, they need to edit that code so if the front end isnt runing the backend shouldnt run either...
[05:22] <cloud-nist> If I leave Ubuntu playing music for a few days straight, my ALSA seems to crash and I can not get my audio back up until I reboot Ubuntu. Does anyone know if this is a bug or if there is a fix??
[05:22] <eduar> ok
[05:22] <fryguy> Strav: it will list noise level and signal level, which is used to verify that he is actually communicating with an AP.  using iwconfig commands tend to return sparse or no output so you can't tell if they are successful or not.
[05:22] <h00k> luddite, try running that as root (put a sudo in front of it)
[05:22] <bullgard4> lstarnes: Thank you for explaining.
[05:22] <Pandora> can anyone assist with vuze or azureus?
[05:22] <mzz> Trenter_: that depends. It is sometimes a feature for the backend to keep running (so that you can reattach a new instance of the frontend when the gui crashes, for example)
[05:23] <mzz> Trenter_: I'm not familiar with this particular emulator at all, so perhaps it is a misfeature here.
[05:23] <RichiV> bullgard4 whats up?
[05:23] <Strav> never mind. Forgot there was the link quality, rx packets failed and such... and mainly, that those could reflect a bad driver or some other problems.)
[05:23] <Trenter_> ok, thanks!
[05:23] <RichiV> bullgard4: whats the problem?

[05:24] <mzz> keith: that's not a list, but iirc it's close
[05:24] <debam> hi to all, i am getting error for wireless connection as ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready
[05:24] <Pandora> installed and ran fine, but after closing cannot find shortcut to re-open..
[05:24] <keith> haha, thanks
[05:24] <keith> !love
[05:24] <ubottu> Love is like racing across the frozen tundra on a snowmobile which flips over, trapping you underneath. At night, the ice-weasels come.
[05:24] <fryguy> cloud-nist: it's going to be driver dependant, check google/launchpad to see if there are specific issues with your driver, and if not, you should probably create a new issue for it.
[05:25] <Strav> ketch1: so in the end, fryguy is right, at this point, if you set the correct essid, you should already see some connection info in iwconfig... mind pasting them?
[05:25] <chuck_> Pandora: it should be under Applications internet
[05:25] <Pandora> not there, did a search and cannot find it there either..
[05:25] <eduar> ok ill try, hte problem is i dont know when is it going to attack again, maybe now maybe not
[05:26] <iamtechno> IS their a way of keeping compiz settings after switching from extra to none?
[05:26] <syadow> hurm i need help here.... why i cant open synaptic and run update manager after enter my password.... and ended with "Failed to run /usr/sbin/synaptic as user root"
[05:26] <cloud-nist> fryguy: Yes, I have thought about it potentially being my sound card as I am using an oldie 16bit Creative PCI card, upgrading to a new card will help me isolate the issue. How would I go about creating a new issue for it as you call it?
[05:26] <sardano> Is Ubuntu 9.04 stable?
[05:26] <peaches> nope
[05:27] <fryguy> cloud-nist: go to launchpad (launchpad.ubuntu.com i think, just google it), and create one
[05:27] <cloud-nist> got it
[05:27] <cloud-nist> ty
[05:27] <fryguy> sardano: define "stable"
[05:27] <Trenter_> Ubuntu 0.94 is stable for me, lol
[05:27] <mzz> sardano: I guess that depends on your definition of "stable" and possibly your hardware
[05:27] <Pandora> it might help to know I didn't use apt-get.. i installed it manually from site
[05:27] <chuck_> Pandora: look in system /preferences/mainmenu/ internet. if not there type vuze in terminal and see if it still there
[05:27] <keith> sardano: It is officially stable, and works great for me
[05:27] <h00k> !bug | cloud-nist
[05:27] <ubottu> cloud-nist: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its derivatives, please file a bug report at: http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu  -  Bugs in/wishes for the bots can be filed at http://launchpad.net/ubuntu-bots
[05:27] <Trenter_> Ubuntu 9.04 on my Thinkpad T61 is a lot better than 8.10 was, had lots of tweaking to get it to work and 9.04 was close to perfect
[05:27] <peaches> ive already had to pin 4 packages from intrepid to make 9.04 work properly
[05:27] <cloud-nist> An app I use in Wine does not play well in 9.04, which I am not really pleased about.
[05:27] <sardano> stable: don't lock, without basic bugs
[05:28] <keith> This is where to come if I need help installing Gentoo, right? :-p
[05:28] <Trenter_> so use 8.10
[05:28] <mzz> sardano: will depend on hardware then
[05:28] <fryguy> sardano: yes it's stable
[05:28] <cloud-nist> Everything else is seemless...
[05:28] <sardano> Asus P5Q and Dell Vostro 1310
[05:28] <mzz> keith: well, you could ask me, actually, but doing it in this channel would be a bit rude to the channel
[05:28] <nilihanth> Is there a quick way to reset the sound controller without rebooting?  (My sound just stopped working and selecting the device says it's already in use by another app)
[05:28] <debam> hi to all, i am getting error for wireless connection as ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready
[05:28] <Strav> iamtechno: yes, in a way, try using fusion-icon (apt-get install fusion-icon) and then, at the bottom of the tabs on the left, you'll have some preferences where you can set a file-based config.
[05:28] <cloud-nist> On my lappy all is well with the new distro...
[05:29] <peaches> 9.04 uses beta for audacity that doesnt work, beta for privoxy that highly recommends against its usage.. it's laughable
[05:29] <mzz> sardano: I'd try to find someone with the same gpu to confirm it's working properly (desktop effects and everything)
[05:29] <keith> mzz: I was kidding, though I am in the process of attempting to. (I don't need any help at the moment)
[05:29] <lstarnes> debam: check the output of dmesg for anything related to that
[05:29] <iamtechno> Strav: let me try that
[05:29] <debam> lstarnes, this is from dmesg only
[05:29] <cloud-nist> I am still trying to figure out the Debian reference ubottu made with the Ice-Weasel comment. :|
[05:29] <Strav> (if I remember well, there are some options to import or export your configs too)
[05:30] <peaches> can't install both librdf0-dev and libsvn-dev simultaneous cause of broken packages. yeah 9.04 not so stable
[05:30] <lstarnes> cloud-nist: it's debian's version of firefox without mozilla's official branding
[05:30] <syadow> hurm i need help here.... why i cant open synaptic and run update manager after enter my password.... and ended with "Failed to run /usr/sbin/synaptic as user root"
[05:30] <lstarnes> debam: what about /var/log/syslog ?
[05:31] <cloud-nist> lstarnes: yeah I know, but ubutto did not convey a heart-felt message.
[05:31] <sardano> mzz: XFXForce 9400GT (NVidia) with 512mb work fine with Ubuntu 8
[05:31] <Strav> lstarnes: with a discusting xpm icon that'll never scale if thing still are like they were.
[05:31] <sardano> mzz: I'm not make a test with Kubuntu 9.04 yet.
[05:31] <glitsj16> iamtechno: not a direct answer i realize, but if you want more finegrained control over your compiz, install compizconfig-settings-manager (ccsm) and save your settings to a flat-file instead of gconf (that way you can take it wherever you want/need it) ... the default you have now is probably simple-ccsm and i don't think it has that feature
[05:31] <cloud-nist> Being under a flipped snow mobile only to be welcomed by ice-weasels does not sound like love to me.
[05:32] <cloud-nist> Maybe I read too much into things :|
[05:32] <chetnick> which chm viewer is better? xchm or gnochm?
[05:32] <Strav> glitsj16: this is the same thing you get with fusion-icon
[05:32] <cloud-nist> gnochm works fine and is simple
[05:32] <eduar> but im here to keith
[05:33] <cloud-nist> chetnick: there is also a firefox addon that lets you view chm inside it.
[05:33] <distrotubux> How do you list the displays Xorg has?
[05:33] <Strav> chetnick: okular package from debian sid has the capability to read tons of formats, including chm. Ubuntu people didn't had time to make a proper package of it since before 8.10 though.
[05:34] <mpontillo> distrotubux: I think you want "xrandr"?
[05:34] <iamtechno> glitsj16: I already have ccsm installed. Didn't know it had an import/export option
[05:34] <TTxT> hi
[05:34] <gloomy> hi
[05:34] <glitsj16> Strav: i thought fusion-icon is independent on what backend you use to configure compiz, it only starts/ends it no ?
[05:34] <chetnick> cloud-nist: well thanks, i will try that, i am using gnochm, but sometimes it does not display contents correct. So i came acros xchm which i did not try, that is why i ask.
[05:34] <beansman> is anyone familiar with port triggering? I was wondering from security perspective, is all of the ranges forwarded or only the ones "triggered" from my computer?
[05:34] <TTxT> does anybody has problems with remote desktop on jaunty???
[05:34] <beansman> is portforwarding more secure than port triggering?
[05:34] <Suhail> how do you install say an upgrade from lke python 2.5.2 -> python 2.6.2?
[05:34] <keith> Is there a reason to make the boot partition non-journaled?
[05:35] <cloud-nist> chetnick: Anytime
[05:35] <glitsj16> iamtechno: well in that case your good to go
[05:35] <cloud-nist> AFK
[05:35] <hacker_kid> how can i get network activity stats for a specific nic (eth0) stats like connection speed to router and current upload/download activity? either a command or a file to read would be nice
[05:35] <ankur_> Hi Guys!
[05:35] <iamtechno> glitsj16: kk, trying the import/export feature now
[05:36] <Digital71> Is it possible to make a taskbar item have a relative location instead of coordinates? I'm using the same Ubuntu install from different resolution displays, and it causes the bars to go haywire. I'd like to be able to tie the clock to the furthermost right position, for example.
[05:36] <Strav> glitsj16: ain't sure of that, but I'm certain it has everything in it's depedencies to manage the config of compiz.
[05:36] <hacker_kid> Suhail, debian hasnt built that package yet, and doing so might cause problems is you dont alt-install. i have a package for 2.6.1 that automatically alt-installs but any modules must be installed manually
[05:36] <glitsj16> Strav: yes probably
[05:37] <ankur_> I use Ubuntu 9.04 and Opera doesn't work. Any way to get it working?
=== RoAk is now known as RoAkSoAx
[05:38] <glitsj16> ankur_: have you tried starting opera from a terminal to catch any errors it might throw?
[05:38] <ankur_> glitsj16, I am a novice. Can you tell me how to do that?
[05:39] <mpontillo> hacker_kid: first take a look at /proc/net/dev for basic counters
[05:39] <glitsj16> ankur_: sure, can you open a terminal ? when you have one open, just run "opera" and see what shows up
[05:39] <ankur_> Yup! I can do that
[05:39] <hacker_kid> mpontillo, thank you
[05:40] <ankur_> It gives something as segmentation fault, with two lines of error
[05:40] <ankur_> What to do next?
[05:40] <beansman> no answer?
[05:40] <glitsj16> ankur_: okay great, just paste the error on paste.ubuntu.com and put the link up here so people can see what's going on
[05:40] <hacker_kid> mpontillo, useful counters but i need to know the current kb/sec (or mb) upload and download in use, not the total
[05:41] <ankur_> Okay! I shall do it
[05:41] <mpontillo> hacker_kid: you can calculate that by diffing the totals over time...
[05:41] <hacker_kid> mpontillo, i could continually read that file, but i was hoping a tool was already made
[05:41] <hacker_kid> mpontillo, i could, what about the connection speed (to the router not to the net)
[05:42] <TWP-SirStaal> Hello I am folliwing this guide to install gtk+ extra: http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/gtk-building.html and when I get to the configure part I get this error: checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
[05:42] <TWP-SirStaal> checking whether build environment is sane... yes
[05:42] <TWP-SirStaal> checking for gawk... no
[05:42] <TWP-SirStaal> checking for mawk... mawk
[05:42] <TWP-SirStaal> checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes
[05:42] <FloodBot3> TWP-SirStaal: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[05:42] <TWP-SirStaal> checking whether build environment is sane... yes
[05:42] <mpontillo> hacker_kid: for that, you can run "ethtool eth0" (unfortunately requires root, not sure if there is another tool available that doesn't)
[05:42] <Strav> is there a place I could find something like "bug reports over time" graph/stats for every ubuntu version? Just wanna check something about 9.04
[05:42] <Suhail> how do you search for packages via apt-get?
[05:42] <lstarnes> mpontillo: can't that be run via sudo?
[05:42] <ankur_> glitsj16, this is the link http://paste.ubuntu.com/166507/
[05:42] <mpontillo> lstarnes: yes, that's what I meant.
[05:42] <glitsj16> ankur_: okay thanks, taking a look
[05:42] <lstarnes> Suhail: apt-cache search package-name
[05:42] <billybigrigger> Suhail, apt-cache search <packagename>
[05:43] <hacker_kid> mpontillo, i can subprocess and grant just that command root and leave the application unprivileged :) thanks again
[05:43] <lstarnes> Suhail: or aptitude search package-name
[05:43] <Suhail> thank you guys
[05:43] <Amarok___> hey guys
[05:43] <mpontillo> lstarnes: (it sounded like hacker_kid was doing this from a script earlier, and I didn't assume the script was running as root)
[05:43] <nilihanth> Is there a quick way to reset the sound controller without rebooting?  (My sound just stopped working and selecting the device says it's already in use by another app)
[05:43] <TWP-SirStaal> Hello I am folliwing this guide to install gtk+ extra: http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/gtk-building.html and when I get to the configure part I get an error. This is the error:checking for C compiler default output... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[05:43] <lstarnes> TWP-SirStaal: you forgot to install build-essential
[05:44] <Amarok___> i am having problem when I load a CD, it claims: "Could not start process Unable to create io-slave:     klauncher said" Unknown protocal
[05:44] <hacker_kid> mpontillo, you assumed correctly, thanks for your help. i never run scripts as root if i can help it :)
[05:44] <TWP-SirStaal> so how do I get that one?
[05:44] <Strav> nilihanth: sudo /sbin/alsa force-reload
[05:44] <chuck_> nilihanth alsa force-reload/pulseaudio restart
[05:44] <Amarok___> any solutions
[05:44] <lstarnes> TWP-SirStaal: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[05:44] <lstarnes> TWP-SirStaal: and why are you compiling gtk+ extra?
[05:44] <Amarok___> i am having problem when I load a CD, it claims: "Could not start process Unable to create io-slave:     klauncher said" Unknown protocal
[05:44] <TWP-SirStaal> Ah thought it would be something like that thanks
[05:45] <TWP-SirStaal> I am going to get SciGraphica and it needs it to work
[05:45] <lstarnes> TWP-SirStaal: install the package libgtkextra-1.0-0
[05:45] <lstarnes> TWP-SirStaal: it may also need libtgtkextra-dev
[05:45] <lstarnes> TWP-SirStaal: oops, libgtkextra-dev
[05:45] <glitsj16> ankur_: do you have java jre installed ? check in synaptic and search for that , loks like opera doesn't find those
=== __guest is now known as bitfish
[05:46] <ankur_> I have that installed, well, let me check for it
[05:46] <TWP-SirStaal> ok I will take that one too
[05:46] <glitsj16> ankur_: specifically, look for sun-java6-jre
[05:46] <TWP-SirStaal> Thanks allot
[05:46] <lstarnes> TWP-SirStaal: if those packages work, you will not need to compile gtk+ extra
[05:47] <sardano> How can I export ubuntu public key for a file?
[05:47] <mpontillo> hacker_kid: almost forgot; another really useful command is "nm-tool" (but it won't work if network manager is not being used)
[05:47] <ankur_> Yeah! I have Sun-Java6-jre version 6-13-1 installed
[05:47] <hacker_kid> mpontillo, thanks
[05:47] <black_13> how do i determine what what wireless key to use?
[05:47] <TWP-SirStaal> So in that pakage gtk+extra got installed?
[05:47] <lstarnes> TWP-SirStaal: you should also check the package manager for programs and libraries before resorting to third-party packages or compiling
[05:47] <black_13> or type of key?
[05:47] <lstarnes> TWP-SirStaal: libgtkextra-1.0-0 is gtk+ extra
[05:47] <TTxT> does anybody has problems with remote desktop on jaunty???
[05:47] <Pandora> chuck_it might help to know I didn't use apt-get.. i installed it manually from site
[05:48] <TWP-SirStaal> aha
[05:48] <lstarnes> TWP-SirStaal: libgtkextra-dev has the development files for it
[05:48] <ankur_> glitsj16, I have Sun-java6-jre 6-13-1 installed already
[05:48] <hacker_kid> mpontillo, network manager is being used in this case, but we will probably move to very very minimal debian installs in the near future
[05:48] <ankur_> What to do next?
[05:49] <glitsj16> ankur_: okay, there's a LD_PRELOAD in your error paste, not sure where you can try to undo that, opera seems not to like it getting started that way
[05:49] <ankur_> So, how to start it the 'other' way?
[05:49] <zvacet> ankur_ : if that is about Opera then preferences>advaced>content >plugin options>find new and restart Opera after that
[05:50] <ankur_> I shall do it

[06:00] <ketch> I was working with Strav for about an hour (about 30 min ago)  He had me run a bunch of commands on command line and use the binpaste

[06:01] <chuck_> nilihanth did you install oss because it does not come as part of jaunty you might be thinking of pulseaudio
[06:01] <Gnea> kbp: turn off desktop effects
[06:01] <iamtechno> kbp: what kind of system do you have?
[06:01] <kbp> Ubuntu 8.04
[06:01] <ankur_> Guys! from where to get to the path given?
[06:01] <Drikan> Gnea: yea i just tryed a new cable a few hrs ago. still the drive works just fine in vista but dose the lock up in linux. I want forum diving and others that have the drive are working fine. but there using the a driver for a slightly newer drive
[06:01] <iamtechno> kbp: I meant what cpu, ram size, etc
[06:02] <kbp> Dual Core 1.6, 4GB RAM
[06:02] <kbp> (laptop)
[06:02] <ankur_> Should I go to system>prefrences>....
[06:02] <lk5246> SATA  2S RAID controller for ubuntu 8.10
[06:02] <iamtechno> kbp: definatly kill desktop effects
[06:03] <Gnea> Drikan: trying to remember... is that a laptop or desktop?
[06:03] <kbp> iamtechno: I use a lot of desktop effects (Compiz fusion), which one to kill?
[06:03] <Drikan> Scrap: while your loged in on your user not root do a ls -l on the directory your trying to get in to
[06:03] <Drikan> Gnea: Desktop
[06:03] <nilihanth> chuck_, my sound app from Preferences was on autodetect, which didn't work.  I went through the list and the only thing that worked was called: HDA Intel STAC92xx Analag (OSS)
[06:03] <dmp1ce> Trying to get my wireless to connect to a WPA network I installed wicd but when I try to connect it says Validating Authentication... for awhile and then quits without connecting.  Any other ideas on what I can do?
[06:03] <iamtechno> kpb: turn desktop effects from whatever to none
[06:03] <Gnea> Drikan: i wonder if it'd make a difference if you changed the settings for it in bios
[06:04] <ankur_> arvind_khadri: I read the contents. But I don't understand how to do that. from where am I supposed to go to that path? Can you help?
[06:04] <Drikan> Gnea: how do you meen?
[06:04] <ketch> Gena, I've only been able to use a cable on this HP laptop dv8000 AMD64 since Breezy.  Strav, I think, thought we were close to having it.  But the wireless didnot pickup.  So I rebooted and came up without the cable in.  No joy.  Rebooted again with the cable and here I am.
[06:04] <ketch> oops Gnea
[06:04] <Scrap> Drikan : here it is  drwxrwx--- 4 root webadmin 4096 2009-05-06 07:47 web
[06:04] <ronin_> hello
[06:04] <TTxT> who can use remote desktop in jaunty???????????????/
[06:04] <Drikan> Scrap: that as root
[06:05] <Amarok___> is ext4 a reliable filesystem
[06:05] <zvacet> ankur_ : so you can go to the Opera? If yes then tools>preferences>advanced>content>plugin options>and then put java in right path
[06:05] <Gnea> Drikan: well, most desktops just 'auto' detect the drives - if you set it as UDMA, specifically, perhaps the problem would go away
[06:05] <arvind_khadri> ankur_: yeah check out where java is
[06:05] <Scrap> Drikan: neg that is as normal user
[06:05] <kbp> iamtechno: so on your one (without desktop effect), the minimized windows pops up instantly when u drag sumthing to it?
[06:05] <Drikan> Scrap: check out the exit out of root and do the same thing
[06:05] <nilihanth> chuck_, woah!  how odd...that OSS item shows up twice in the list.  The 2nd one worked!  lol.  I don't know what that means but I hope I don't have to do this everytime I login
[06:05] <ankur_> Where java is? You mean, the path to it?
[06:05] <Gnea> ketch: are you up to 9.04?
[06:05] <ketch> Gnea,  8.10
[06:05] <zvacet> ankur_ :yes
[06:05] <mpontillo> ketch: can you pastebin the contents of /etc/network/interfaces?
[06:06] <Drikan> Gnea: all right ill give that a go
[06:06] <Suhail> how do you find out the version of a package?
[06:06] <Suhail> or information about it
[06:06] <Drikan> BRB
[06:06] <mobi-sheep> Amarok___: Nothing is ever reliable.  Not even your family.
[06:06] <hylke> how the fuck do i get my  keyboard right_
[06:06] <iamtechno> kbp: yes but I also have a very powerful system too.
[06:06] <ketch> do it now mponillo
[06:06] <lstarnes> Suhail: aptitude show package-name
[06:06] <mobi-sheep> Suhail: aptitude show <xyzpackage>
[06:06] <mneptok> !language > hylke
[06:06] <ubottu> hylke, please see my private message
[06:06] <Amarok___> i mean compared to ext3
[06:06] <hylke> how do i get my keyboard right
[06:07] <hylke> not with all the a- at the wrong places cS
=== owen1 is now known as dan
[06:07] <mobi-sheep> Amarok___: Who say ext3 was reliable too? I'm using ext4 right now and I haven't experienced any issues that were outlined on the 'net.
=== raiden is now known as Guest47441
[06:07] <mpontillo> ketch: just trying to move things along, I can't help right this minute. but if you have anything in /etc/network/interfaces other than references to "lo", network manager will not be able to manage your interfaces. we already determined that network manager was not managing them.
[06:08] <kbp> iamtechno: I turned desktop effect off, still same issue (and I timed it, it's actually 1 sec)
[06:08] <Gnea> ketch: have you tried wicd?
[06:08] <mobi-sheep> Amarok___: I say you should go for ext4.  Production Servers?  Please use ext3.
[06:08] <kbp> iamtechno: how strong is ur system? Core i7?
[06:08] <glitsj16> ankur_: look in your .opera folder for a file javapath.txt and see if zvacet's proposed changes can be set there
[06:08] <chuck_> nilihanth  glad to here Sound is the biggest headache in linux at least for me
[06:09] <ketch> mpontillo, http://paste.ubuntu.com/166517/
[06:09] <iamtechno> kpb: hey i've got to go. Sorry to bail. I have a phenom x4 @ 2.4 ghz, 4gb ram, and an ati radeon hd 4870
[06:09] <nilihanth> chuck_, yeah I've struggled with it a lot in the past versions...'tis why I was very happy to find that 8.10 worked out of the box.
[06:09] <kbp> iamtechno: ok c ya (I love 4870)
[06:09] <ankur_> glitsj16: I am trying to do that. (Actually I am hitting in the dark, well, not a bad start for learning)
[06:09] <ketch> Gnea, wicd does not show on Synaptic Package Manager
[06:10] <Suhail> for some reason when i use screen i can never use backspace it just says "Wuff -- Wuff"
[06:10] <glitsj16> ankur_: take your time, we'll flash a torch if you're not back in 30 minutes
[06:10] <iamtechno> kpb: Sorry I couldn't be of more assistance. Yeah the 4870 rocks. u might try asking someone else.
[06:11] <lstarnes> Suhail: what about ctrl+h?
[06:11] <ankur_> Okay! Thank you glitsj16
[06:11] <Gnea> ketch: ah yes, it's been introduced in jaunty... http://wicd.sourceforge.net/download.php
[06:11] <zvacet> ankur_: http://www.opera.com/support/kb/view/584/
[06:11] <kbp> iamtechno: dw
[06:11] <mjm52> yo
[06:11] <Suhail> lstarnes: same
[06:11] <lstarnes> Suhail: what happens if you type some characters then backspace?
[06:11] <Suhail> lstarnes: same thing
[06:12] <Amarok___> well thanks mobi-sheep i was just a littel reluctant i have heard ppl say it isn't as stable as ext3 but alls well now thanks man
[06:12] <Suhail> lstarnes: do you know how to fix that?
[06:12] <lk5246> SATA  2S RAID controller
[06:12] <Gnea> ketch: not sure if wicd will actually work or not, but for wireless, it's way better than network manager
[06:12] <ketch> Gnea,  at this point if I went after that url I'm afraid I'd never see you again
[06:12] <lstarnes> Suhail: I'm not sure
[06:12] <Rickster> i was wondering what a tiny star inside the square of a package in SYNAPTIC means
[06:12] <lk5246> join #ubuntu-au
[06:12] <Gnea> ketch: pessimism won't get you very far ;)
[06:12] <Suhail> lstarnes: also it nevers takes on the characteristics in my bash_profile
[06:13] <krammer_> can i extract a rar with ubuntu
[06:13] <mobi-sheep> Amarok___: No problem.  Have fun with ext4.  New stuffs for you. :)
[06:13] <Gnea> krammer_: yes.
[06:13] <ketch> Gnea, I've been futzing around with wireless on since
[06:13] <ketch> Breezy
[06:13] <Gnea> ketch: yeah, i've been doing it for quite awhile too... wicd is worth trying
[06:14] <zvacet> krammer_ : install p7zip p7zip-full p7zip-rar and after that jusr right click on rar file
[06:14] <Gnea> ketch: if all else fails, just make sure you have the networkmanager .deb laying around
[06:14] <gabox> can someone help me with lp0 add-on pci card?
[06:14] <ketch> I think you're too advanced for this poor newbie
[06:15] <Gnea> gabox: what's the problem? plug it in and...?
[06:15] <Gnea> too advanced...
[06:15] <glitsj16> Rickster: i believe the star refers to an upgradable package
[06:15] <krammer_> Gnea, i get an error message when i insert a cd or dvd no hal
[06:15] <lk5246> #ubuntu
[06:15] <Rickster> ok
[06:15] <NoobSeekingInfo> Hey does anyone here use the DccAssist plugin for XChat and might be able to tell me how it works for them?
[06:15] <Rickster> thanks
[06:16] <dmp1ce> How can I tell what my wireless card in my computer is?
[06:16] <krammer_> lspci
[06:16] <Gnea> !wireless | dmp1ce
[06:16] <gabox> gnea thanks, the problem is the card is reconized but i cant control it
[06:16] <ubottu> dmp1ce: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[06:16] <Gnea> krammer_: is udevd running?
[06:16] <NoobSeekingInfo> or anything at all about dcc related plugins would be nice
[06:16] <Crash1hd> Hmm I just clicked on windows in grub and all I am getting is Starting up ...???
[06:16] <gabox> it have 2 serial port and 1 parallel port
[06:16] <Suhail> whoa what happened to all the sun-java6* packages?
[06:17] <ankur_> glitsj16: I have managed to reach the folder you told, but I can't find javapath.txt file
[06:17] <gabox> and de serials port works fine
[06:17] <krammer_> Gnea,  this is weird i have lots to burn and cant with k3b nor brsero
[06:17] <Gnea> gabox: what happens when you load parport.ko?
[06:17] <ankur_> Also the path specified in the pastebin link is link is not as it is in my computer
[06:17] <mjm52> Crash1hd sounds like you were editing your /boot/grub/menu.lst file
[06:17] <Gnea> krammer_: 8.10?
[06:17] <Crash1hd> mjm52: well I followed the instructions on the ubuntu help site for fixing grub
[06:18] <krammer_> yes
[06:18] <gabox> Gnea, how can i load it?
[06:18] <Crash1hd> mjm52: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?action=show&redirect=RestoreGrub
[06:18] <Gnea> krammer_: how long ago did hal start malfunctioning?
[06:18] <Gnea> gabox: sudo modprobe parport
[06:18] <krammer_> 2 weeks
[06:18] <chuck_> crash1hd where you ever able to boot windows
[06:18] <mjm52> Crash, i don't think windows puts the message 'Starting up' on your console
[06:18] <glitsj16> ankur_: okay, so i suggest making a file in that location with your exact path to the jvm, it should contain only one line (mine looks like /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/i386
[06:18] <krammer_> i recently built this machine
[06:18] <Crash1hd> chuck_: when I first installed it
[06:18] <mjm52> sounds like under windows you're unsuccessfully loading an ubuntu distro
[06:18] <krammer_> well about 4 months ago
[06:19] <Gnea> krammer_: do you know what caused hal to malfunction? an upgrade?
[06:19] <lk5246> raid problems help
[06:19] <krammer_> works fine with pista
[06:19] <Gnea> heh
[06:19] <kbp> does any1 know how to change the interval delay for "drag & drop"!? It takes like 1 sec to popup the minimized windows when I drag sumthing to it. It's too long for me!!!
[06:19] <chuck_> crash1hd  after installing linux could you boot into it
[06:19] <Crash1hd> chuck_: not sure dont think so
[06:19] <Crash1hd> never actually tried until today
[06:19] <krammer_> Gnea,  I honestly dont know
[06:20] <Gnea> kbp: install a better wm, like windowmaker, fluxbux, xfce or enlightenment
[06:20] <mjm52> well you're running some OS right now... which one?
[06:20] <Crash1hd> problem is that windows wasnt / isnt seeing the whoe hdd
[06:20] <Crash1hd> mjm52: laptop
[06:20] <Crash1hd> mjm52: windows
[06:20] <Gnea> krammer_: do you have any logs with errors about it?
[06:20] <mjm52> ah
[06:20] <Crash1hd> :)
[06:20] <chuck_> crash1hd  so you had windows then installed linux ontop of it
[06:20] <krammer_> no
[06:20] <ScottG> What is a good way to be able to send myself emails from the command line. So that way I can have myself emailed when certain things happen on my system
[06:20] <Gnea> krammer_: are you sure? what does /var/log/syslog say when you insert a dvd?
[06:20] <Crash1hd> chuck_: I had a 1tb drive that I installed windows onto the first 20gigs then installed ubuntu on the rest
[06:20] <kbp> Gnea: what does wm mean? (I'm on Ubuntu 8.04)
[06:20] <Crash1hd> chuck_: ubuntu is working but windows wont boot
[06:21] <monstah> kbp: Windowmanager
[06:21] <Gnea> kbp: window manager
[06:21] <gabox> Gnea, i did it modprobe, now what
[06:21] <monstah> ;)
[06:21] <Gnea> gabox: see if it showed up - check with the dmesg command
[06:21] <Cousss> does anyone know why when i hit ctrl+alt+f1 my screen turns black and begins to blur to white. anyone know how to fix this or why it is happening
[06:21] <kbp> Gnea: how to find out which wm I'm using !?
[06:21] <monstah> kbp: you're probably using gnome+metacity
[06:21] <monstah> :)
[06:21] <ankur_> glitsj16: What should I name the file?
[06:21] <Gnea> kbp: did you install standard ubuntu or something else?
[06:21] <mjm52> Crash, what does it say under title Windows XP in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[06:22] <glitsj16> ankur_: javapath.txt
[06:22] <ankur_> And would there be only path in that file? In simple text?
[06:22] <kbp> Gnea: yes just standard Ubuntu ( & Compiz fusion - is Compiz fusion a wm?)
[06:22] <mjm52> should say something like
[06:22] <mjm52> rootnoverify(hdx,y)
[06:22] <Crash1hd> mjm52: I will check will be a min as I just loaded bartpe to see what it sees
[06:22] <systm> I have a HP Dv3-1075us and I just installed Jaunty x64, everything works but the sound, and I can't seem to find anyone else's support that works for me, would anyone be willing to assist me on this issue?
[06:22] <Crash1hd> ahh yes it says rootnoverify(hd0,0)
[06:22] <glitsj16> ankur_: correct, just the one
[06:22] <ankur_> Well, I am doing it
[06:22] <mjm52> anything else?
[06:22] <Gnea> kbp: no, compiz is just an overglorified gui effects thing
[06:23] <kbp> monstah: ok let me google it lol I'm a newbie in Linux lol
[06:23] <mjm52> like makeactive or chanloader +1
[06:23] <Crash1hd> yes both
[06:23] <mjm52> hmmm
[06:23] <kbp> Gnea: ok let me google more lol
[06:23] <Gnea> kbp: like i'm stopping you lol
[06:23] <monstah> kbp: hehe if you installed standard ubuntu you have gnome as your desktop environment and metacity as wm
[06:23] <krammer_> Gnea, gotta go thanks for your time
[06:23] <mjm52> as long as windows is on your first partition of your first HD it should be working
[06:23] <kbp> Gnea: so which wm comes with standard ubuntu?
[06:23] <Gnea> krammer_: cheers and good luck
[06:23] <Cousss> does anyone know why when i hit ctrl+alt+f1 my screen turns black and begins to blur to white. anyone know how to fix this or why it is happening
[06:23] <Gnea> kbp: gnome and metacity
[06:23] <monstah> kbp: apt-get install openbox
[06:23] <monstah> ;)
[06:24] <mjm52> sounds like a bad video driver
[06:24] <Gnea> Cousss: sounds like your video driver is setup incorrectly
[06:24] <glitsj16> ankur_: have you had time to check that link zvacet gave you ? about java-common (that has to be installed as wella
[06:24] <Cousss> thanks ill check the settings again
[06:24] <mjm52> Crash, double check your partition layout in gparted
[06:24] <Crash1hd> mjm52: thats what doesnt make any sense
[06:24] <kbp> monstah: so openbox is the best wm ?
[06:24] <mjm52> the other thing that might be wrong...
[06:25] <kbp> monstah: which one is the best? lol
[06:25] <RichiV> dang it the second time ubuntu crashed on me
[06:25]  * Gnea considers e17 the best wm - but i'm not everyone ;)
[06:25] <RichiV> whats wrong?
=== ScottG is now known as op
[06:25] <monstah> kbp: haha that has to be your own choice, i love openbox
[06:25] <mjm52> if you told grub to install itself on hd0,0 instead of just hd0, it may have overwritten windows' boot record
=== op is now known as Scottg
[06:25] <Crash1hd> mjm52: its ok I had to use testdrive to fix it
[06:25] <RichiV> i try and use wine with guildwars
[06:25] <Gnea> RichiV: ice is ice, ubuntu won't stop it! ;)
[06:25] <RichiV> and the graphics freeze?
[06:25] <mjm52> oh, what's testdrive?
[06:25] <monstah> kbp: i'd suggest you google screenshots or something for a good look of the different WM's
=== Scottg is now known as ScottG
[06:26] <Crash1hd> mjm52: it fixes partitions long story short something had happened and screwed up all the partitions
[06:26] <Gnea> RichiV: is this an upgrade or fresh install?
[06:26] <SoylentYellow> Is there any tool for imaging partitions or making backups of linux partitions? (Like with Acronis TrueImage under Windows)
[06:26] <Makuseru> Hi, I just upgraded to 9.04 from my previous install on 8.04 and i seem to be having a problem. I can't set any resolution higher than 1024x786. When i was using 8.04 i had a program called "displayconfig-gtk" that would let me force a large resolution, but that isn't included in 9.04. So are there any other ways to force a larger resolution?
[06:26] <ScottG> What is a good way to be able to send myself emails from the command line. So that way I can have myself emailed when certain things happen on my system
[06:26] <mjm52> oh nice :)
[06:26] <Crash1hd> mjm52: it was able to repair them so I could log into windows
[06:26] <mjm52> good to know
[06:26] <Haris_Amin> mjm52:
[06:26] <Crash1hd> i mean ubuntu
[06:26] <kbp> monstah: if I install new wm, does that mean I have to re-config the setting for Compiz Fusion again? (it took me a day to config it so I really dun wanna lose it)
[06:26] <kbp> Gnea: thank you Gnea
[06:26] <RichiV> Gnea: this is the most current version
[06:26] <Crash1hd> mjm52: its in the universal supository
[06:26] <Haris_Amin> mjm52: u there...u were helping me out ealiere with the windows parititons
[06:26] <mjm52> so now you get into windows ok?
[06:26] <Gnea> SoylentYellow: i've found clonezilla to fit that bill
[06:26] <Crash1hd> mjm52: very very powerfull program
[06:26] <monstah> kbp: i don't know about compiz, ain't using it
[06:26] <monstah> :)
[06:26] <RichiV> Gnea: so ist he Wine and driver for my comp ATi MObi Radeon X600
[06:27] <Crash1hd> mjm52: no this is happening after doing the fixes
[06:27] <chuck_> crash1hd  here is what i am getting at when you install windows it throws files everywhere on the hard drive without defraging the drive before a linux install you risk over writing window files 9 out of 10 times this will not happen it's the 10th time that get's you
[06:27] <Haris_Amin> mjm52: its booting straight to windows...i need to be able to choose between teh 2 in grub
[06:27] <Gnea> RichiV: what i'm wondering is, is the .wine/ setup fresh or did you create it with a previous installation?
[06:27] <xipi> hi
[06:27] <gabox> Gnea, i find this "[   17.683548] lp0: using parport0 (polling)." with dmesg
[06:27] <monstah> kbp: guess compiz only works with gnome+metacity
[06:27] <RichiV> Gnea: its fresh
[06:27] <Crash1hd> chuck_: ahh
[06:27] <RichiV> Gnea straight from the site
[06:27] <xipi> how can i open a file as a different user from nautilus
[06:27] <Gnea> gabox: okay, try plugging a printer in and reload it
[06:27] <cir> my nvidia driver won't let me use higher resolutions than 1360x768 and when I use resolutions higher than 1024x768 the viewable area smaller than the resolution is
[06:27] <RichiV> imma try GW again without the drivers installed
[06:27] <kbp> monstah: .... ok let me figure out how to change the setting of metacity
[06:28] <SoylentYellow> clonzilla? This can be run from Linux session and has a GUI? I'm looking for something easy to use like Acronis products under Windows or similar apps that do system backups under Windows.
[06:28] <Crash1hd> chuck_: mjm52: the good news is that now bartpe is seeing the C drive as 20 gigs (it wasnt before)
[06:28] <mjm52> oh that's pretty strange, Crash
[06:28] <glitsj16> kbp: just make sure you enter your new wm command into compiz settings under "Window decorations"
[06:28] <celling> Hello, how can I know which ubuntu version I have installed?
[06:28] <Crash1hd> mjm52: boot.ini is ok too
[06:29] <zvacet> celling : lsb_release -a
[06:29] <kbp> glitsj16: yea sure... thank you dude i'll check
[06:29] <celling> zvacet: Thank you.
[06:29] <zvacet> np
[06:30] <forces> openoffice has something similar like word art?
[06:30] <systm> how do i check and see what driver is being used for my audio devices>
[06:30] <ScottG> What is a good way to be able to send myself emails from the command line. So that way I can have myself emailed when certain things happen on my system
[06:30] <chuck_> crash1hd: when you chose windows in grub it goes to the starting windows screen correct then hangs
[06:30] <RichiV> how do i know if i am a 64 bit comp?
[06:30] <painted82> i'm going to try out ubuntu
[06:30] <painted82> are there any supportive people i can depend on
[06:31] <Crash1hd> chuck_: it doesnt even get that far it goes black and says Starting up...
[06:31] <glitsj16> kbp: another nice place to set something up in compiz is the "crash handler", so it can start a wm if it fails
[06:31] <Rabbitbunny> painted82: a couple hundred.
[06:31] <painted82> cool
[06:31] <sysdoc> painted82, Not really, just us in here
[06:31] <forces> openoffice has something similar like word art in ms word?
[06:31] <painted82> now does ubuntu recognize intel raid out of the box
[06:31] <painted82> or do i need special drivers
[06:31] <ankur_> glitsj16, zvacet, arvind_khadri, Thank You all! Thank you for bearing me all the time, when I had almost been bugging you. Though the problem hasn't got solved, I have got an idea how to do it. And I shall do in the evening. Now, I gotta attend my classes, so, I have to go now. One again, Thank you!
[06:31] <cir> my nvidia driver won't let me use higher resolutions than 1360x768 and when I use resolutions higher than 1024x768 the viewable area smaller than the resolution is
[06:31] <Crash1hd> chuck_: just did a chkdsk and now doing a defrag in bart pe just to be on the safe side
[06:32] <cir> and I don't know how to fix it
[06:32] <SoylentYellow> I've tried several tools, but all these Linux tools do simple folder backups. There is nothing like all those WIndows tools that can image your entire system while you are running it.
[06:32] <glitsj16> ankur_: okay, enjoy the class and the ubuntu, see you
[06:32] <ankur_> See ya glitsj16!
[06:32] <ankur_> bye! Have a nice time ahead
[06:32] <n2diy> SoylentYellow: have you looked at mondo?
[06:32] <NoobSeekingInfo> Does anyone have any recommendations or info they'd be willing to share about dcc plugins for XChat?
[06:33] <billybigrigger> SoylentYellow, i could be wrong but i believe you can't image the system while you are running it due to filesystem limitations
[06:33] <n2diy> billybigrigger: check out mondo, I think you can.
[06:33] <billybigrigger> SoylentYellow, not because of ubuntu itself, but because of ext3/ext4 i think this might be possible soon with btrfs
[06:33] <glitsj16> ScottG: http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2008/10/21/sending-email-from-your-system-with-ssmtp/ might be of interest to you
[06:34] <Elixir> how do you turn off the multiple desktop thing? i'm tired of accidently scrolling to the other desktop when i'm surfing the interweb
[06:34] <rawrcore> I have a strange problem where left alt and right alt are activating by themselves without any keyboard input ubuntu 9.04
[06:34] <kbp> glitsj16: actually is there any "import/export" feature in Compiz Fuson? like I can make a backup file of the settings and restore later when I need (i.e. dont have to waste time to re-configure it again)
[06:35] <n2diy> Elixir: right click on an open space in your panel, then properties, and reduce your panels to one.
[06:35]  * NoobSeekingInfo sees a lot of plugins listed at xchat.org, but doesn't know which are good for helping with dcc in Xchat
[06:35] <gabox> Gnea, thanks  see u later
[06:35] <glitsj16> kbp: in the compizconfig-settings-manager there is yes, not in little-ccsm i think
[06:35] <Gnea> gabox: cheers
[06:35] <Amarok___> hey guys i am having a littel problem a couple of weeks back i installed ubuntu but as i was then having display problem i used the xforcevesa mode to boot into the live cd and it installed my system in xforcevesa mode now how do i get out of the xforcevesa mode the best resolution it gives me is 800x600 its a bit to chunky pls guys can some one help me
[06:35] <Elixir> i dont have an option for the "panels"
[06:36] <Elixir> wait, nevermind
[06:36] <Elixir> thank you n2diy
[06:36] <glitsj16> kbp: i think the default settings manager uses gconf as backend, easier with a flat flie import/export facility like in compizconfig-settings-manager
[06:36] <SoylentYellow> Oh ok, so system imaging = no-go under Linux. Can you tell me which folders I need to backup in case of drive failure?
[06:36] <Amarok___> guys
[06:37] <glitsj16> kbp: *file; you sure wouldn't want flies in your compiz
[06:37] <ScottG> glitsj16: ok reading this over thanks!
[06:37] <n2diy> Elixir: how about customize panel?
[06:37] <Drikan> Gnea: well there is no option to set it to UDMA thow i wonder is this could be an issue.  i have the drive linux is on connected to an PATA to SATA adapter and the DVDRAM drive is connected to the PATA port on the MB. think that could be an issue?
[06:37] <kbp> glitsj16: I think i've found that window. So is the "export" of the profile is what I need?
[06:37] <glitsj16> ScottG: you're welcome, have it set up like that since 7.10, works just fine
[06:37] <Elixir> i figured it out, you have to right click the bottom right thing that shows the desktops, and click "columns" to 1
[06:37] <glitsj16> kbp: yes thats it
[06:38] <kbp> glitsj16: and lower is the "backend" that you were talking about
[06:38] <kbp> glitsj16: what should I do with it?
[06:38] <Amarok___> hey guys i am having a littel problem a couple of weeks back i installed ubuntu but as i was then having display problem i used the xforcevesa mode to boot into the live cd and it installed my system in xforcevesa mode now how do i get out of the xforcevesa mode the best resolution it gives me is 800x600 its a bit to chunky pls guys can some one help me
[06:38] <Gnea> Drikan: might be... and i didn't get a chance to tell you - for cd/dvdrom drives, it would be a PIO mode, not UDMA (for disks)
[06:38] <billybigrigger> what program can i use to burn an audio_ts and video_ts directory? its a dvd
[06:38] <systm> How do i add a user to a group?
[06:38] <Gnea> Drikan: sorry about that
[06:39] <glitsj16> kbp: correct, set the backend to flat file and export your settings to produce a backup, that's all it takes
[06:39] <zvacet> systm : sudo adduser username group
[06:39] <systm> zvacet: thanks.
[06:39] <Gnea> Drikan: i've never used an adapter like that, so i imagine its effects to be quite wild at times - i'd try it without
[06:39] <Drikan> Gnea: well in any case that is no option to set that and the rom supports pio 1-4
[06:40] <tod> exit
[06:40] <zvacet> systm:np
[06:40] <systm> well that didnt fix my audio issue.
[06:40] <Drikan> well that would meen disconnecting the drive from sata and connecting it to the pata
[06:40] <Gnea> Drikan: right. depending on the drive and the speed it matches up with the system, it will probably be 3 or 4
[06:41] <Gnea> Drikan: couldn't hurt
[06:41] <sysdoc> Amarok___, You'd need to install the correct drivers for the Vid Card
[06:41] <painted82> guys i have a creative sound card
[06:41] <painted82> do u know a place where i can get linux drivers for it
[06:41] <Drikan> Gnea: how do you think that would effect the startup?
[06:41] <Gnea> unless you leave flea power laying around
[06:41] <Gnea> Drikan: not at all
[06:41] <Drikan> ok ill try that
[06:41] <glitsj16> systm: did you restart pulseaudio after adding yourself to the pulse groups ?
[06:41] <kbp> glitsj16: the export thing is available for both method (flat-file & Gconf)... lol I've just export one of each to make sure lol
[06:41] <Drikan> Gnea: ill be back in a few
[06:42] <glitsj16> kbp: heh, smart move
[06:42] <systm> glitsj16: still says im not part of the pulse-rt group
[06:42] <glitsj16> systm: so add yourself and try again
[06:42] <systm> glitsj16: it says im still part of the group
[06:42] <NoobSeekingInfo> Does anyone know any good plugins for XChat?  especially those that make dealing with dcc easier?
[06:43] <glitsj16> systm: which is it ? only houdini could be in 2 groups at the same time
[06:43] <eswood> alguien me puede ayudar con el wine??
[06:43] <Amarok___> is there like a script i can use to hide the icons on my desktop
[06:44] <abama> how to compile ppp statically? what cflags to pass?
[06:44] <systm> glitsj16: what do you mean, i'm in pulse-rt
[06:45] <glitsj16> systm: well your former line confused me, my bad
[06:45] <systm> glitsj16: its ok.
[06:45] <systm> glitsj16: do i have to use Pulse?
[06:45] <glitsj16> systm: no
[06:46] <Crash1hd> mjm52: you still around?
[06:46] <abama> what CFLAGS can compile source statically?
[06:46] <systm> glitsj16: well either way, something is muted because my SoftKeys  Mute button is still the same color as being muted
[06:46] <Gnea> abama: er, -static does it, iirc
[06:47] <glitsj16> systm: you can change your sound prefs to use alsa for instance ... but if things are muted, no sound settings will deliver audio, checked your mixer settings yet ?
[06:47] <painted82> well i'm gonna go ahead and install ubuntu
[06:47] <painted82> wish me luck
[06:47] <systm> yes, nothing is muted
[06:47] <Crash1hd> mjm52: you where wondering what my menu.lst file was saying it says rootnoverify (hd0,0);savedefault;makeactive;chainloader +1; <--- the ; represents an enter
[06:48] <glitsj16> systm: are you on jaunty ? there are some issues i believe using audio on certain cards
[06:48] <systm> glitsj16: yes.. :(
[06:48] <abama> Gnea: CFLAGS=-static?
[06:48] <glitsj16> systm: let me get a link, one moment pls
[06:48] <systm> ok.
[06:49] <abama> Gnea: -static or --static?
[06:49] <exodus_ms> Is it possible to configure the columns in 'top'? I would like to increase the spacing between PID %MEM, etc.
[06:50] <glitsj16> systm: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4928900 has a very detailed set of instructions to configure pulseaudio, im tracking down somethin else as well
[06:52] <the_curator> Has anyone's wireless interfaces stopped working after a recent (48h) package update and reboot?
[06:52] <glitsj16> systm: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/sound-solutions-for-ubuntu-904-jaunty-users.html ... i nrealize it's a read, but it might be a good idea to get a general view on how pulseaudio works, it's explained in the forums link better than i ever could, perhaps take that as a first stepping stone
[06:53] <systm> glitsj16: if its becoming a standard i'll look at it.
[06:53] <ScottG> glitsj16: Is there a way so that everything can be automated?
[06:53] <rawrcore> I have a strange problem where left alt and right alt are activating by themselves without me pressing any keys ubuntu 9.04
[06:53] <glitsj16> systm: yes it sure looks that way
[06:53] <Dym1111> <unconvertable> <unconvertable> !
[06:54] <ScottG> glitsj16: Like, I can enter a subject manually with -s, but what about a body? I seem to ened to type the body in manually

[06:54] <systm> glitsj16: for linux as a whole or just *buntus
[06:54] <cir> I'm trying to configure my graphics settings and dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg just asks me a ton of crap about my keyboard and closes
[06:54] <glitsj16> systm: pulseaudio is used all over the place these days
[06:55] <systm> glitsj16: does it play nice with MPD/sonata/mpc?
[06:55] <vader> Anybody know how to set hardware acceleration for frame buffer vesafb driver using fbset? To list 1233 files in console takes 27s, while in X it's a zippy 0.77s.
[06:55] <glitsj16> systm: very much so yes
[06:55] <systm> glitsj16: excellent
[06:55] <Maksueru> Hi, I just upgraded to 9.04 from 8.04. But now I can't set my resolution any larger than 1024x786. When I was using 8.04 i used a program called "displayconfig-gtk" that allowed me to force 1400x1200 resolution, but apparently that program is no longer available. Does anyone know any other program or wya to force a larger resolution?
[06:56] <glitsj16> ScottG: hang on please, i'm slow :)
[06:56] <Drikan> Gena: well at lest it hasent locked up yet
[06:56] <Drikan> just not mounting
[06:57] <c0mp13371331337> Maksueru: Hardware info?
[06:57] <Patrique> hi, can we add a search text box in our gnome taskbar like we can do with google on windows?
[06:58] <systm> glitsj16: i need to reboot brb
[06:58] <Drikan> Gnea: should it auto mount?
[06:58] <glitsj16> systm: okay, hope you get some improvements
[06:59] <Brando753> how do u open a .run file?
[06:59] <Maksueru> c0mp13371331337: ATI Radeon 9200, Intell P4 2.2ghz, 1gb ram.
[07:00] <Patrique> this is not the appropriate channel or nobody knows?
[07:00] <kbp> Patrique: right click then add panel
[07:00] <painted> hey guys
[07:00] <painted> ubuntu does not recognize my raid set up
[07:01] <painted> help please!
[07:01] <sacarlson> <unconvertable> Brando753: I think in a terminal window if it's not already set to excutable chmod +x filename.run    then ./filename.run
[07:01] <kbp> Patrique: *add to panel
[07:01] <ScottG> glitsj16: np
[07:01] <c0mp13371331337> Maksueru: Radeon 9200, wow, used to have that EXACT card.  I remember it always giving me trouble, no matter what I was doing.  What driver are you using for it?  If memory serves me correctly, the 9200 was the cutoff model for fglrx support.  All models above it had support in fglrx, but the 9200 and below were out of luck.
[07:01] <ScottG> glitsj16: Maybe you could show me an example of one of those commands?
[07:02] <ghindo> This is kind of a stupid question, but I keep getting a "permission denied" error with transmission-daemon; can anybody give me some unix permission tips to fix this?
[07:02] <glitsj16> ScottG: yes i was looking into that, i also use sendemail, has a very easy interface
[07:02] <Maksueru> c0mp13371331337: Ya, it kinda sucks that i cant use fglrx, I'm using the Versa drivers right now. Ive always been able to force it to other resolutions with other programs, but now that this one is gone Im not sure how to do it anymore.
[07:02] <CodeWar> i m on intrepid using emacs 22.2.1. I notice a very strange issue, if I click on the left hand corner window menu ( the one thathas minimiz/maximize/move ) it takes a long time before this works for emacs
[07:02] <CodeWar> this extra time is taken only for emacs windows not for other applications
[07:03] <Brando753> sacarlson: thanks works perfectly
[07:03] <KingKimi> hi
[07:03] <c0mp13371331337> Maksueru: Granted, it's been a year or two since I've used ATI anything, but if memory serves me correctly, I had better luck using the open ATI drivers.  Have you given that a shot yet?
[07:03] <KingKimi> i got this error tring to install a tar.gz contents  "**Error**: You must have `libtool' installed.
[07:03] <KingKimi> You can get it from: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/
[07:03] <KingKimi> " but in that page what to download ??     i mean, in this page : which one to download ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libtool/   ........
[07:04] <Maksueru> c0mp13371331337: No, not yet.
[07:04] <ScottG> glitsj16: hm ok, sendmail
[07:04] <dhiren> hi
[07:05] <dhiren> hi to everybody
[07:05] <glitsj16> ScottG: sendemail, not sendmail
[07:05] <c0mp13371331337> Maksueru: Give it a shot, it'd definitely be better to have somewhat native drivers rather than forcing a general VESA driver.
[07:05] <Patrique> kbp: yeah i know this, but what i would like is an input box to search on the net
[07:05] <sacarlson> <unconvertable> KingKimi:  apt-get install libtool
[07:05] <doleyb> KingKimi: that's a bad way to get libtool
[07:05] <ScottG> glitsj16: uuh, whats with the e?
[07:05] <KingKimi> doleyb, but the terminal said that...
[07:05] <KingKimi> sacarlson,  ok
[07:06] <doleyb> KingKimi: yeah it did, but install the autoconf and autotools-dev packages instead
[07:06] <ScottG> oh email
[07:06] <KingKimi> doleyb, from sudo apt-get install autoconf ?
[07:06] <glitsj16> ScottG: it is the package name, i didn't choose it, i guess the author wanted to make sure it didn't collide with sendmail
[07:07] <abama> how to compile user-lever ppp source code statically?
[07:07] <doleyb> KingKimi:  sure like that, or libtool, or whatever it takes
[07:07] <Myztikal_> Hi, i've decided to make the switch from Windows to Ubuntu and i was just wondering if there's a way to run windows apps
[07:07] <Myztikal_> more on a gaming level than anything else
[07:07] <systm> glitsj16: didnt seem to fix anything.
[07:08] <doleyb> Myztikal_: there is wine.  It is used to run WOW and stuff.
[07:08] <shipitkthx> i use cairo dock in jaunty, has anyone been able to actually stop the gnome-panel from starting? i dont want it anymore and cant get rid of it
[07:08] <Myztikal_> How reliable is wine?
[07:09] <Myztikal_> and i'm specifically trying to run Ragnarok (really old) and TF2/CS
[07:09] <glitsj16> ScottG: sendEmail -f glitsj16@gmail.com -t scottg@gmail.com -u "testing ubuntu" -m "Testing ubuntu's ability to use cdmline mail" -s smtp.gmail.com:587 -xu <USERNAME FOR SMTP AUTHENTICATION> -xp <PASSWORD FOR SMTP AUTHENTICATION> -q
[07:09] <glitsj16> is one way to use it ... it also takes a -o switch: your mail body in a file if you prefer it that way (instead of the -m routine)
[07:09] <doleyb> Myztikal_: old stuff would tend to be better.  If you've noticed Windows Vista, many new games fail to run right even on genuine Microsoft(tm) Windows(r).
[07:09] <crashatau> Myztikal Have a look in WineHQ appdb, see if it's supported
=== [_FireSoul_] is now known as shr
[07:10] <Myztikal_> ok thanks.
[07:10] <glitsj16> systm: too bad, i take it you made those changes mentioned on the forums page ?
[07:10] <crashatau> doleyb: "many new games fail to run right even on genuine Microsoft(tm) Windows(r)", what a load of crap jeez
[07:10] <Myztikal_> also, if i have the .exe files from Windows am i allowed to run it on Ubuntu
[07:10] <systm> glitsj16: pretty sure.
[07:10] <systm> glitsj16: its showing Audio levels changing but something is muted
[07:11] <babio> is there a way to modify the "notify messages" features of ubuntu 9.04?
[07:11] <glitsj16> systm: sounds like it doesn't find your output device
[07:11] <doleyb> crashatau: It isn't hard to find complaints from many windows users that X or Y recent game functions poorly.
[07:12] <systm> glitsj16: maybe, its it possible to specify what Audio Card when using alsamixer

[07:16] <c0mp13371331337> Maksueru: I *believe* they're already installed, you just need to point to them with your xorg.conf.  As I mentioned, it has been a while since I configured an ATI card, but that's what I had to do.

[07:21] <ScottG> glitsj16: That seems like it is it, but i need to install some libs first
[07:21] <abama> how to disable -shared option when running make?
[07:21] <glitsj16> ScottG: also an option yes
[07:21] <iter> CodeWar: use rsync
[07:21] <paul68> hi I have a problem with my bcm driver after the upgrade to kernel version 2.6.28.12 generic in 9.04 its not working and I don't get it to see in the restricted driver part where it was before how to resolve this problem?
[07:21] <superboy> my disk wont eject after using k3d
[07:21] <Amarok--> hey guys what does aircrack-ng do
[07:22] <sacarlson> <unconvertable> shipitkthx:  sorry I'm on Hardy
[07:22] <jschall> brasero estimates i'm burning at 360 KiB/s, while i can watch the counter incrementing by at least 2MiB/sec. Kind of an annoying, microsoft-esque useless estimate.
[07:23] <kbp> does anyone know how to decrease the delay of drag and drop (without changing wm - im on gnome)? it takes like 1 sec to pop up the minimized window when I drag sumthing into it. It's too long (i need it appear instantly lol)
[07:23] <kindofabuzz> brasero sucks, i still get failed burns even though it's sucessful, been like that the last 4 ubuntu's =)
[07:23] <kbp> (remember: without changing wm)
[07:24] <jschall> kindofabuzz: oh great, i only have one disc
[07:24] <jschall> kindofabuzz: or do you mean brasero says it's bad when it's good?
[07:24] <ScottG> glitsj16: HA! I got it. That error message was perfect. Lead me exactly to the libraries I needed to apt-get
[07:24] <kindofabuzz> jschall, it will still be sucessful, yeah but it always says it fails for me
[07:25] <jschall> kindofabuzz: hmm
[07:25] <glitsj16> ScottG: glad you found it, my notes are terrible lol; could have taken me another week to track it down
[07:25] <paul68> hi I have a problem with my bcm43xx driver after the upgrade to kernel version 2.6.28.12 generic in 9.04 its not working and I don't get it to see in the restricted driver part where it was before how to resolve this problem?
[07:25] <sacarlson> <unconvertable> shipitkthx: I just checked my laptop it runs 9.04 and it's not grayed out eather
[07:25] <kindofabuzz> jschall, not saying it will do that for you, just i've had that problem for years, so i finally switched to gnome-baker
[07:25] <ScottG> glitsj16: lol thats ok. You were right about this program having a good and easy interface. Now I wonder if it can read from a config file...
[07:26] <ScottG> glitsj16: I don't like putting my password into commands at all
[07:26] <systm> glitsj16: how should I add the Front to default.pa?
[07:26] <shipitkthx> sacarlson thats weird because im reading tons of problems of people not being able to delete it because they got rid of the "current session" option in 9.04
[07:27] <mcnellis> What packages do i need to install so i have man pages for strstr, fprintf, etc.
[07:27] <glitsj16> ScottG: it can pick it up yes, from /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
[07:27] <KingKimi> how do i minimize any running to the system tray ???? like i want to minimize the transmision whenever i click close button to systemtray like that of utorrent in xp.... any from synpantic ?
[07:27] <abama> what should be passed to CFLAGS in order to specify the flags "--enable-static, --extra-libs=-static, --extra-cflags=--static", finally statically compile the pppd program?
[07:27] <thee_> hey huys i was using xp -kmplayer so i ve chanced my os. now i m looking for good mediaplayer that i can use two subtitle at the same time.  are there any aplication that support ubuntu?
[07:27] <CodeWar> iter, thanks rsync is cool
[07:28] <abama> statically compile and link pppd
[07:28] <trece8> KingKimi, you can download alldock, try using add/remove programs and look for "dock"
[07:29] <paul68> I get this error message :The following packages have unmet dependencies:linux-restricted-modules-generic: Depends: linux-restricted-modules-2.6.28-12-generic but it is not installable E: Broken packages   how to solve this
[07:29] <trece8> KingKimi, i meant "AllTray"
[07:29] <KingKimi> trece8, ok
[07:29] <ScottG> glitsj16: I don't see a way to designate a config file? It just uses /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf by default and only that?
[07:30] <trece8> paul68, restart and start with "(recovery mode)" kernel
[07:30] <glitsj16> systm: look for a line in your /etc/pulse/default.pa load-module module-alsa-sink, i have it uncommented and added a " device=hw:0,0" to it, was all it took to get pulseaudio working for me, working stable (adjust the hw:0,0 for your ecact setup offcourse)
[07:30] <trece8> then, put "try fixing broken packages"
[07:30] <KingKimi> trece8, thnx .. i got it
[07:30] <paul68> trece8: in the terminal?
[07:30] <trece8> KingKimi, does it work? I downloaded it today
[07:30] <punknroll_> hi after updrading from 8.10 to 9.04 i always have to /etc/init.d/networking restart to get online
[07:30] <KingKimi> trece8, yes.. it works
[07:30] <trece8> paul68, do what i said
[07:30] <KingKimi> trece8, thnx
[07:30] <paul68> trece8: ok brb
[07:31] <glitsj16> ScottG: correct, ssmtp was so bright to set itself as the systems MTA so it all combines
[07:31] <trece8> really... it's simpler than doing in terminal, i think
[07:31] <trece8> i don't know what you should run in terminal, like sudo dpkg --configure -a or something like that
[07:31] <KingKimi> what is the difference between crossover and wine ??
[07:31] <trece8> just reboot, go to "(recovery mode)" and use "Try to fix broken packages" (it says something about dpkg)
[07:32] <kindofabuzz> KingKimi, crossover is wine in a pretty GUI that cost $ =)
[07:32] <trece8> KingKimi, the basic one is that i don't have a clue about what "crossover" is :P
[07:32] <trece8> one question of mine... how do i change what programs autostart?
[07:32] <glitsj16> ScottG: could you refresh my memory in connection to the extra libs you needed to nstall please, i'm noting this down this time
[07:33] <punknroll_> crossover is commercial and wine is not
[07:33] <ScottG> glitsj16: hm, well I tried just leaving out the user and pass but it didn't work
[07:33] <trece8> i  want to get the nm-applet out of my sight
[07:33] <painted82> hey guys, i just tried to install ubuntu and almost lost my raid array
[07:33] <painted82> can anyone help
[07:33] <ScottG> glitsj16: However, i can put the username and pass into files and cat them on the go as arguments
[07:33] <pahom> hi all
[07:33] <ScottG> glitsj16: yea sure let me just go get the names
[07:33] <kindofabuzz> trece8, system > preferances > startup apps
=== baskingshark is now known as paul68
[07:34] <trece8> mmm... i'm in xubuntu
[07:34] <paul68> trece8: same problem
[07:34] <ScottG> glitsj16: "sudo apt-get install libnet-ssleay-perl" AND "sudo apt-get install libio-socket-ssl-perl"
[07:34] <glitsj16> ScottG: no rush, as you notice, i am slow, maybe need some sleep here in a moment, thanks in advance
[07:34] <kindofabuzz> trece8, oh, it's in the menus somewhere i assume
[07:34] <trece8> kindofabuzz, i assumed too, i just can't find it
[07:34] <ScottG> glitsj16: lol its np you helped me out a bunch
[07:34] <glitsj16> ScottG: okay great, noted that down, thanks for that
[07:34] <systm> glitsj16: that didnt work
[07:34] <trece8> paul68, really? What message did it say after you run dpkg?
[07:35] <ScottG> glitsj16: So do I need to specify an option so that it will use the ssmtp.conf so I dont need to enter my user and pass?
[07:36] <glitsj16> ScottG: to be honest i can't remember how i set it all up, been almost 2 years
[07:36] <KingKimi> kindofabuzz, but i downloaded crossoverchrome from their site .without filling forms for money ?
[07:36] <glitsj16> systm: hmm, but it didn't break your headphine output i hope
[07:36] <arvind_khadri> <unconvertable> <unconvertable> hi, if i wanted to make the login based on domain, do i have to change workgroup to domain in ldap.conf ???
[07:36] <KingKimi> kindofabuzz, i cant understand
[07:36] <KingKimi> :(
[07:37] <kindofabuzz> KingKimi, you got the trial, look at the .deb, i bet it says trial
[07:37] <ScottG> glitsj16: I find it odd that the system thinks it is ok for it to allow you to write your password in plain text like that to the ssmtp.conf where anyone can read it
[07:37] <systm> glitsj16: yes
[07:37] <paul68> trece8: don't see it but I get when I try to install the restricted modules unmet dependencies broken packages but will reboot again and see if there was an error
[07:37] <arvind_khadri> ikonia: around ??
[07:38] <xr78> hello all
[07:38] <Amarok--> bye guys
[07:38] <glitsj16> ScottG: /etc/ is not available to jus anyone ( i hope), but granted, i should have stated from the beginning that this is on a one user system
[07:38] <painted82> guys i'mt rying to install ubuntu on an existing raid array
[07:38] <painted82> but ubuntu didn't recognize the raid array during installation
[07:39] <ScottG> glitsj16: Well so is mine, i still don't like having my text file in plain sight. I am pretty sure  that anyone can look at the contents of /etc
[07:39] <gasull> Hi.  I'm trying to upgrade from 8.04 to 8.10 (and then 9.04).  I get this error: "It was not possible to authenticate some packages. This may be a transient network problem. You may want to try again later. See below for a list of unauthenticated packages. libnm-glib-vpn0
[07:39] <gasull> network-manager
[07:39] <xr78> Update manager is giving me quite a bit of grief, in that I keep getting a Partial Upgrade dialog box, to which I choose to install the partial upgrade, but then it fetches a package and closes, without installing anything and without warning, like it's crashing...
[07:39] <gasull> network-manager-gnome
[07:39] <xr78> any ideas?
[07:39] <Myztikal_> Hi, is there an "MSN" equivalent on Ubuntu. Preferably a clear and clean GUI because Pidgin doesn't satisfy me :/
[07:39] <gasull> ".  How can I ignore this problem?  Thank you
[07:39] <kindofabuzz> Myztikal_, Amsn
[07:39] <gasull> Myztikal_: Pidgin
[07:39] <kindofabuzz> i think it's called
[07:39] <Myztikal_> thanks
[07:40] <magnetron> Myztikal_ <unconvertable> Emesene is a nice MSN client
[07:40] <trece8> Myztikal_, cleaner than pidgin?
[07:40] <systm> glitsj16: i'll try this later :|
[07:40] <Myztikal_> anyone know any guides to help my transition from windows to ubuntu?
[07:40] <trece8> Myztikal_, search in google, it's way better than any possible guide
[07:40] <Myztikal_> thanks all.
=== Kwitschibo_ is now known as Kwitschibo
[07:40] <Myztikal_> ok
[07:41] <trece8> anyway, Myztikal_ , you can remove the format bars from pidgin, the format of the sender, the post time and all that
[07:41] <keith> It seems like Ubuntu should have some sort of gentle introduction when you first install it. :-p
[07:41] <trece8> it is reaaaallly clean
[07:41] <glitsj16> ScottG: now i remember, i chmod'ed 0600 the ssmtp.conf
[07:41] <trece8> keith, ... gentle like "I assume you were pirating software, so now..."?
[07:42] <gasull> Anybody knows how I can ignore the auth error above?  Thanks
[07:42] <taropalo> Hi just upgraded from 8.10 -> 9 but now everytime I restart the machine it starts doing updating packages but I guess it fails because next time it starts again
[07:42] <keith> trece8: lol, something like that.
[07:42] <kindofabuzz> Myztikal_, here a good Ubuntu guide, http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com/index_main.html
[07:42] <ActionParsnip> gasull: uninstall network-manager maybe
[07:42] <ubuntistas> http://resnet.missouristate.edu/images/wireless/wireless-ubuntu-04.png what that blue signal means that they are others connectected to my network any clue?
[07:43] <gasull> ActionParsnip: it isn't installed
[07:43] <gasull> ActionParsnip: Actually I'm trying installing those packages before upgrading
[07:43] <gasull> ActionParsnip: right now
[07:43] <ESphynx> hey guys when I install ubuntu and changed a partition type
[07:43] <ESphynx> is it going to keep it in GUID mode ?
[07:44] <crashatau> ubuntistas means they are encrypted networks, WEP or WPA etc
[07:44] <trece8> GUID?
[07:44] <ESphynx> OSX partition scheme?
[07:44] <trece8> sorry, I have no idea about that
[07:44] <trece8> have you googled it?
[07:44] <ESphynx> trying to
[07:44] <ActionParsnip> gasull: just uninstall whatever it doesnt like first
[07:45] <magnetron> ESphynx <unconvertable> the easiest way is to use Boot Camp to create a "windows partition" and install onto that
[07:45] <Kartagis> I am stuck in screen resolution 800 x 600. what to do?
[07:45] <ActionParsnip> gasull: you can also speed up the wole thing with: sudo apt-get --purge autoremove; sudo apt-get install deborphan; sudo apt-get --purge remove `deborphan`
[07:45] <Kartagis> ubuntu 9.04
[07:45] <ESphynx> magnetron that's what I did
[07:45] <ActionParsnip> Kartagis: install video drivers
[07:45] <trece8> esphynx... blame google :P ... it brings all results about "GUIDE" instead of "GUID".... i miss the old altavista.com
[07:45] <ESphynx> I already had a Windows partition, but i had to change it to XFS...
[07:45] <gasull> ActionParsnip: thanks
[07:45] <ESphynx> now I'm worried it will change my GUID to MBR
[07:45] <trece8> Kartagis, install restrictive drivers
[07:46] <ActionParsnip> trece8: try www.ask.com  www.msn.com
[07:46] <gasull> Actually the problem was fixed after installing the packages
[07:46] <ActionParsnip> trece8: other search engines do exist
[07:46] <magnetron> ESphynx <unconvertable> Boot Camp makes sure it's both MBR and GPT compatible
[07:46] <gasull> ActionParsnip: Actually the problem was fixed after installing the packages
[07:46] <Kartagis> ActionParsnip, package name?
[07:46] <trece8> ActionParsnip, but ones that search "GUID" and not "GUIDE"?
[07:46] <ESphynx> magnetron ... ah , you realy meant bootcamp
[07:46] <ActionParsnip> Kartagis: well what video card do you have first, would be useful dont you think?
[07:46] <gasull> ActionParsnip: but I didn't start the upgrade so I'll do what you say too
[07:46] <ESphynx> So I should do that?
[07:46] <Kartagis> ActionParsnip, one sec
[07:46] <ActionParsnip> gasull: if its gonna roll then go for it
[07:47] <ActionParsnip> Kartagis: lspci | grep -i vga
[07:47] <painted82> i'm trying to install ubuntu on existing raid 0 array
[07:47] <painted82> can anyone help me
[07:47] <magnetron> ESphynx <unconvertable> yeah that's why i said boot camp
[07:47] <ESphynx> magnetron : thanks :P
[07:47] <KingKimi> what is difference between win4lin and wine ?? is it a good thing to buy win4lin ?
[07:47] <paul68> trece8: I got error messages that it couldn't remove stuff and sugested apt-get autoremove which I did however still no way to install the restricted drivers module

[07:48] <trece8> ActionParsnip, try it for yourself... if you look for "GUID" it comes up with things for "guide"... no actual search engine can undestand that you are not making a typo
[07:48] <trece8> Kartagis, download envyng
[07:48] <ESphynx> magnetron : although this is a PC... you still mean bootcamp? :P
[07:48] <trece8> from Add/remove software, and install the latest ATI driver
[07:48] <Kartagis> trece8, what envyng?
[07:48] <paul68> trece8: since the upgrade to kernel version 8-12 my bcm43 driver isn't working
[07:48] <ActionParsnip> trece8: what of GUIDs? do you want an explanation of them, do you want to use them in fstab?
[07:48] <KingKimi> trece8, with quotes , i think i get the results :D
[07:48] <trece8> Kartagis, download it!
[07:49] <ActionParsnip> !envy | Kartagis
[07:49] <ubottu> Kartagis: EnvyNG is a program to install newer version of nVidia drivers, which can be found in !Universe as "envyng-gtk" or "envyng-qt". It is NOT a supported method to install them; please only use it at your own risks if standard methods fail - See !nVidia
[07:49] <ActionParsnip> trece8: see above
[07:49] <trece8> ActionParsnip, I already know
[07:49] <ActionParsnip> trece8: dont advise people use garbage unsupported solutions
[07:49] <indus> hi
[07:49] <ScottG> glitsj16: ah ok, let me look that up
[07:49] <Kartagis> ActionParsnip, I don't have a nvidia card
[07:49] <magnetron> ESphynx <unconvertable> you specifcally mentioned Mac OS.
[07:49] <trece8> ActionParsnip, garbage? :S
[07:49] <ActionParsnip> trece8: so what do you want to know of GUIDs? If you simply search for GUID its gonna give you nothing
[07:49] <trece8> Kartagis, you have a ATI card, envyng works with ATI too
[07:49] <ActionParsnip> Kartagis: you dont need one
[07:50] <trece8> i searched "GUID ubuntu"
[07:50] <magnetron> ESphynx <unconvertable> as i said, boot camp's the easiest way. there are several others of course.
[07:50] <glitsj16> ScottG: hope you can get it all worked out, i have to get to the office, take care
[07:50] <_Brun0_> Is there a way to have ubuntu application/system menu to be launched from Gnogme-do Docky?
[07:50] <trece8> it could simply say "no results", but instead of it, gives lots of results .... where it has GUID.. nowhere.....
[07:50] <ScottG> glitsj16: yea actually everything seems to work awesome now. Thanks again
[07:50] <Myztikal_> Is there a feature in ubuntu that manages the processing power like vista?
[07:50] <ActionParsnip> trece8: thats a rubbish search criteria
[07:50] <trece8> ??
[07:50] <ActionParsnip> trece8: and its obvios why it assumed you thought guide
[07:50] <paul68> ActionParsnip: can you help me out with a bcm driver problem since the kernel upgrade from 2.6.28-11 to 2.6.28.12
[07:50] <glitsj16> bye all, enjoy the buntu's
[07:51] <trece8> it shouldn't assume a thing
[07:51] <ActionParsnip> trece8: what EXACTLY do you want to know about GUIDs?
[07:51] <trece8> how do you look for webpages with ubuntu and GUID
[07:51] <trece8> and just that
[07:51] <Kartagis> trece8, ActionParsnip: that started happening randomly after i upgraded to 8.10. now it's always like that. do I still need it?
[07:51] <trece8> ActionParsnip, I don't have a problem with that
[07:51] <Kartagis> trece8, I don't have an ATI
[07:51] <trece8> I hate the way you can't search things that seem like typos
[07:51] <ActionParsnip> trece8: its assuming you mean Ubuntu Guide as there are lots of guides for ubuntu, if you search for something better then you will get better results
[07:52] <trece8> Kartagis, <Kartagis> ActionParsnip, 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. KM400/KN400/P4M800 [S3 UniChrome] (rev 01)
[07:52] <trece8> oh sorry...
[07:52] <trece8> ActionParsnip, there's no excuse, if i want to search typos I should be able to do so
[07:52] <trece8> sometimes it's very useful
[07:53] <billybigrigger> after apt-get remove wine
[07:53] <ActionParsnip> trece8: like search for guid fstab linux and try that in www.yahoo.com
[07:53] <bubba> I'm having ati issues
[07:53] <billybigrigger> how do i remove all the config files??? i want a clean install of wine
[07:53] <ActionParsnip> trece8: yahoo has an option to actually search what you actually typed
[07:53] <ActionParsnip> trece8: try other search engines than google
[07:53] <MarkJones> I just wanted to let anyone know that is having nothing but lockups and bad luck with the nvidia.com drivers, the 185.53 pre-release drivers are wonderful for me so far.Might help some of you so i figured id share.
[07:53] <trece8> for example, how could you get the results of pages that say "gren tre" instead of "green tree"?
[07:53] <ActionParsnip> trece8: some actually have better functionality but everyone is google brainwashed
[07:53] <bubba> I'm having ati issues
[07:53] <paul68> ActionParsnip: can you help me out with a bcm43xx driver problem since the kernel upgrade from 2.6.28-11 to 2.6.28.12

[07:56] <trece8> bubba, go to add/remove programs, search envyng
[07:56] <indus> bubba: its in the repos
[07:56] <trece8> download it
[07:56] <ActionParsnip> bubba: envy is not advised, what video card do you have?
[07:56] <Kartagis> ActionParsnip, xserver-xorg-video-openchrome is already the newest version.
[07:56] <trece8> check "all available apps"
[07:57] <trece8> ActionParsnip, .... c'mon.... ..... that's the only way i got my screen to work!
[07:57] <bubba> ati mobility x600
[07:57] <ActionParsnip> Kartagis: then add the driver line to xorg.conf and it will load, read the examples in the post i gave
[07:57] <admin_masu3701> when i run command "top" i see at-spi-registry
[07:57] <indus> ActionParsnip: not adviced? isnt it officially in universe now?
[07:57] <admin_masu3701> what is that?
[07:57] <ActionParsnip> trece8: maybe for you yes. Lets try do it the proper way first shall we
[07:57] <trece8> no, first the fast way
[07:57] <ActionParsnip> bubba: whats the output of: lspci | grep -i vga
[07:57] <trece8> then, the not-so-fast, and such
[07:57] <trece8> fast/easy
[07:58] <ActionParsnip> trece8: no, because every time you upgrade the kernel you have to revert to vesa, reboot to new kerenel and then rerun, its not graceful or practical
[07:58] <admin_masu3701> when i run command "top" i see at-spi-registry
[07:59] <Kartagis> ActionParsnip, do I just add the line Driver openchrome?
[07:59] <trece8> ActionParsnip, not really
[07:59] <admin_masu3701> what is "at-spi-registry" ?
[07:59] <trece8> admin_masu3701, googled it?
[07:59] <ActionParsnip> Kartagis: from what that says, yes
[07:59] <MarkJones> Man now that the NVIDIA drivers are getting fixed with the 185.53 that are up and coming, 9.04 seems like a realy great release.
[07:59] <BilokShem> What is a good Bit Torrent like program that will work with all OS's?
[07:59] <baz> is it nautilus or ubuntu that makes it so easy to connect to networks and shares like samba, etc....?
[07:59] <ActionParsnip> !torrent | baz
[07:59] <ubottu> baz: Torrent clients: Transmission (GTK and terminal-based), Deluge-Torrent, Freeloader, BitStormLite, BitTornado-GUI (GTK), KTorrent (KDE), QTorrent (Qt), Azureus (Java), TorrentFlux (web-based), bittornado, rTorrent, cTorrent, bittorrent, aria2 (terminal-based) - FAQ: http://www.bittorrent.com/FAQ.html - See also !P2P
[08:00] <ActionParsnip> baz: it can be
[08:00] <trece8> ActionParsnip, torrent have nothing to do with that
[08:00] <BilokShem> what is a good bit torrent program?
[08:00] <trece8> baz, it is nautilus, if you say about the "Connect to server..." thingyu
[08:00] <MarkJones> BilokShem: Your guess is as good as anyones if there are any at all that are crossplatform.I have no idea.But none are hard to use at all so Im not sure why that would matter to ya.But to each his own.
[08:00] <ActionParsnip> BilokShem: see above
[08:00] <baz> trece8, yeah that and being able to type "smb://server/share"
[08:00] <ActionParsnip> trece8: wrong target, sheesh
[08:00] <GnosticAscension> @Bilokshem use FireTorrent inside firefix, heard it's pretty good
[08:00] <bubba> Need to update drivers for ati mobililty x600
[08:01] <GnosticAscension> Azureus/Vuze is also pretty good
[08:01] <BilokShem> Thanks
[08:01] <trece8> baz, I don't use samba, so... never knew about that
[08:01] <BilokShem> Does Vuze risk Viruses?
[08:01] <trece8> the connect to server is from nautilus
[08:01] <BilokShem> and Spyware and adaware?
[08:01] <GnosticAscension> BilokShem: virus risks always there
[08:01] <Brando753> how do i compile a .tar.gz file
[08:01] <ActionParsnip> bax: if the samba share will always be available you can use smbmount in fstab
[08:01] <GnosticAscension> but not in linux really
[08:01] <GnosticAscension> Brando753:
[08:01] <trece8> Brando753, you have to extract it
[08:01] <BilokShem> is torrent safer than using something like Gnutella?
[08:01] <bubba> Need to update drivers for ati mobililty x600
[08:01] <baz> so i installed Crunchbag (ubuntu based distro) and it uses OpenBox... what should I be researching to be able to connect to an smb share?
[08:01] <GnosticAscension> type tar-xvzf [filename]
[08:02] <MarkJones> adaware is Windowz issue not linux.
[08:02] <ActionParsnip> Brando753: you dont compile a tar.gz you extract it with   tar zxvf ,file>
[08:02] <trece8> Brando753, or just click with the right mouse button and extract
[08:02] <baz> trece8, you dont use smb? I use between linux boxes... not recommended?
[08:02] <BilokShem> My teste satchel is heavy
[08:02] <trece8> lots easier
[08:02] <GnosticAscension> baz : that is a crunchbang issue really
[08:02] <trece8> ActionParsnip, you tend to use the CLI too much
[08:02] <GnosticAscension> baz : not ubuntu
[08:02] <bubba> Need to update drivers for ati mobililty x600
[08:02] <trece8> baz, I'm not that big user... really...
[08:02] <GnosticAscension> *Note* Crunchbang != Ubuntu
[08:03] <Brando753> what do i do next
[08:03] <baz> Crunchbang is to Ubuntu as Xubuntu is to Ubuntu
[08:03] <trece8> I use ssh
[08:03] <ActionParsnip> bubba: http://www.uluga.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1134935   or
[08:03] <GnosticAscension> Brando753: look for a folder with the name of the archive
[08:03] <ActionParsnip> !ati > bubba
[08:03] <ubottu> bubba, please see my private message
[08:03] <trece8> Anyway, baz... between linux? ... ssh, man
[08:03] <trece8> why samba?
[08:03] <ketch> Back again.  In my absence I went through the steps of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Feisty_No-Fluff#Step%202b:%20sp33008%20Driver%20Download/Extraction
[08:03] <MarkJones> baz: Is that an offical release of Canonical?
[08:03] <Pandora> can anyone assist me: the apt-get package for vuze didn't want to work so I installed manually from file obtained from site. it installed and ran, but I can't find shortcut to restart it now that i've exited, any ideas?
[08:03] <trece8> no, baz, that is incorrect
[08:03] <GnosticAscension> baz : unofficial though [that's a lot of the problem right there]
[08:03] <ketch> And got... zilch.
[08:03] <MarkJones> not sure bout that
[08:04] <baz> trece8, yeah using fuse right? I use that remotely all the time but it seems overkill on my local network
[08:04] <drbobb> hey, is it normal that gnome doesn't know to restore open programs from a previous session into their proper virtual desktops, but instead packs them all into a single workspace? KDE has been doing this right for a long time now
[08:04] <trece8> baz, just ssh :S
[08:04] <GnosticAscension> Pandora: locate it using the locate command
[08:04] <SandGorgon> what do i have to install in a fresh jaunty install to be able to configure desktop effects
[08:04] <Pandora> how?
[08:04] <trece8> ssh me@othermachine
[08:04] <GnosticAscension> first do sudo updatedb in the terminal
[08:04] <baz> MarkJones, GnosticAscension, good points its not official - but damn it runs so much faster than even xubuntu on my EEE901
[08:04] <GnosticAscension> then locate [filename]
[08:04] <ActionParsnip> Pandora: try typing vuze in terminal and hitting enter
[08:04] <trece8> Pandora, download Catfish and search in it
[08:05] <superboy> my image wont burn ...help it says "The drive cannot be locked (Ongoing burning process)"
[08:05] <KingKimi> how do i search a file using terminal ?
[08:05] <baz> trece8, but then how do u transfer files?
[08:05] <GnosticAscension> @ActionParsnip good point if path is set :P
[08:05] <trece8> KingKimi, man locate
[08:05] <ActionParsnip> Pandora: or use find, no need for locate of catfish: sudo find / -name vuze*
[08:05] <MarkJones> SandGorgon: Install jaunty , 3d display driver and CCSM(compizconfig settings manager) to adjust effects.
[08:05] <trece8> but.... you can search with Catfish
[08:05] <ketch> Maybe the HP dv8000 with Broadcom 4311 or 4319 with an AMD64 and U8.10 just doen't do wireless.  Anyone else care to suggest?
[08:05] <magnetron> SandGorgon <unconvertable> nothing, but if you want more details in your config you can use the "simple-ccsm" package or ccsm
[08:05] <chetnick> KingKimi: find /path -name nameofthefile
[08:05] <GnosticAscension> Catfish is a new layer
[08:05] <magnetron> !ccsm | SandGorgon
[08:05] <ubottu> SandGorgon: To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Ubuntu: install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' or 'simple-ccsm'. If you install the latter, a new option will appear in your appearance properties - See also !compiz - Help in #compiz-fusion
[08:05] <GnosticAscension> layers = trouble
[08:05] <GnosticAscension> :P
[08:05] <ActionParsnip> chetnick: exactly..weird people needing an app isnt it
[08:05] <trece8> not really, GnosticAscension
[08:06] <GnosticAscension> trece8: joking man
[08:06] <superboy> my image wont burn ...help it says "The drive cannot be locked (Ongoing burning process)"
[08:06] <trece8> From the side of the people trying to do other things that computing .... not!
[08:06] <MarkJones> SandGorgon: Tons af tuts on gogole for it too.
[08:06] <GnosticAscension> trece8: not in this case obv
[08:06] <drbobb> gnome doesn't seem to restore window geometry from a previous session properly, either
[08:06] <MarkJones> I love gnome
[08:06] <trece8> GnosticAscension, anyway... I know people that would say that seriously...
[08:06] <GnosticAscension> drbobb: that's the least of gnome's troubles believe me
[08:06] <trece8> MarkJones, gnomophiliac!
[08:06] <GnosticAscension> :P
[08:06] <drbobb> is this what i should expect or is something broken for me?
[08:06] <MarkJones> hehe
[08:07] <superboy> markjones what uuuuubuntu do u have?
[08:07] <KingKimi> trece8, how come locate command is very fast in locating files ???? :O :O :O ??
[08:07] <MarkJones> 9.04 i386
[08:07] <ActionParsnip> KingKimi: its has a database of EVERY file, it just searches that
[08:07] <trece8> KingKimi, because he uses turbo engine, with biodiesel
[08:07] <hawk> KingKimi: Because it uses a cached list of files
[08:07] <brEz> Is it possible to show PC stats in /etc/motd for ssh users?
[08:07] <superboy> kubuntu?
[08:07] <Brando753> i extracted, how do i compile?
[08:07] <drbobb> GnosticAscension: actually I'm not finding it as bad as I feared, mostly it's the session management that seem buggy
[08:07] <GnosticAscension> kubuntu sucks really
[08:07] <bubba> Need to update drivers for ati mobililty x600
[08:07] <MarkJones> KDE scares me.
[08:07] <trece8> Brando753, search for a README
[08:07] <GnosticAscension> i think the whole of KDE sucks
[08:07] <chetnick> It might now find the file if you use locate, depending on when the database was updated last.
[08:08] <ActionParsnip> Brando753: if you are asking that, you shouldnt be compiling
[08:08] <KingKimi> hawk ActionParsnip thanx
[08:08] <GnosticAscension> KDE4 = infinite trouble
[08:08] <trece8> Brando753, what program are you trying to compile?
[08:08] <KingKimi> trece8, :P
[08:08] <ActionParsnip> GnosticAscension: amarok is killer
[08:08] <GnosticAscension> @Brando753
[08:08] <GnosticAscension> ActionParsnip: that is the *only* killer KDE app
[08:08] <KingKimi> ActionParsnip, if i delete a file , will the database entry be deleted too ? :O
[08:08] <SandGorgon> magnetron, thanks!
[08:08] <Brando753> a world editor for the arkhart game engine
[08:08] <ActionParsnip> KingKimi: not sure, i dont use it as I know where all my files are
[08:08] <bubba> I need to test and see if I have hard excelleration.
[08:08] <chetnick> not right away, next time the database is updated
[08:08] <drbobb> GnosticAscension: actually kde3 was and is quite good, too bad it's been condemned to bitrot
[08:08] <bubba> Boxee wn't load
[08:08] <GnosticAscension> Brando753: type ./configure
[08:09] <ActionParsnip> GnosticAscension: i like ktorrent but its out of habit
[08:09] <MarkJones> Ive never even seen KDE4
[08:09] <ActionParsnip> GnosticAscension: other than those 2 apps I can use any desktop and be fine
[08:09] <GnosticAscension> ActionParsnip: you can have ktorrent in Gnome with few dependencies
[08:09] <superboy> uu have gnwhat toreent client u use?
[08:09] <kulight> any one know a open source OO DB ?
[08:09] <chetnick> i had Amarok carshing on 8.04, is it working fine on 9.04?
=== Dykam_ is now known as Dykam
[08:10] <MarkJones> whats a OO db?
[08:10] <drbobb> kde4 doesn't suck too bad either, except for the buggy abomination that is plasma
[08:10] <GnosticAscension> yeah that was supposed to be the innovation
[08:10] <superboy> what dependecis u need?
[08:10] <kulight> object oriented database
[08:10]  * GnosticAscension stifles laughter
[08:10] <MarkJones> open office you mean or what?
[08:10] <MarkJones> oh
[08:10] <GnosticAscension> OO DB?
[08:10] <MarkJones> google it
[08:10] <GnosticAscension> hm
[08:10] <ActionParsnip> GnosticAscension: i use LXDE
[08:10] <GnosticAscension> dunno much DB stuff
[08:10] <drbobb> actually dolphin is a bit better than nautilus, and kate is a lot better than gedit
[08:10] <ActionParsnip> GnosticAscension: and i'm aware of dependancies etc :)
[08:10] <GnosticAscension> ActionParsnip: Lubuntu ? :P
[08:11] <ActionParsnip> GnosticAscension: essentially
[08:11] <trece8> i use ratpoison, i rule :P
[08:11] <ActionParsnip> drbobb: tried pcman?
[08:11] <GnosticAscension> ActionParsnip: I know, was making a point, not educating ya
[08:11] <ActionParsnip> GnosticAscension: i gotcha
[08:12] <MarkJones> I cant wait for like Jaunty to have like 2-300 updates/fixes so i can use Ubuntu Customization Kit to slipstream all of em together onto a DVD, that should be one realy nice dependable OS.
[08:12]  * ActionParsnip does the vm dance
[08:12] <drbobb> ActionParsnip: no I haven't
[08:12] <Brando753> GnosticAscension: ** full path to gtk-config.
[08:12] <Brando753> configure: error: Cannot find GTK: Is gtk-config in path?
[08:12] <ActionParsnip> drbobb: slick and fast file manager
[08:12] <GnosticAscension> btw I have an old box, 700Mhz, 256 MB RAM, any suggestions what to put on it for fast performance?
[08:12] <Pandora> <ActionParsnip> located it in /home/shane but if i type vuze and hit enter in terminal, it tells me that it's not installed
[08:12] <ActionParsnip> GnosticAscension: puppy
[08:12] <GnosticAscension> [might have to use Crunchbang after all :P)
[08:12] <drbobb> GnosticAscension: more RAM would be a good start
[08:12] <MarkJones> GnosticAscension: your call, check specs for different distros and try em all.
[08:13] <trece8> GnosticAscension, use ratpoison, too
[08:13] <Kartagis> why do I see a huge play button on flash web sites?
[08:13] <trece8> use claws for mail
[08:13] <GnosticAscension> drbobb: no it's a *really* old machine with SDRAM (gasp!)
[08:13] <MarkJones> Kartagis: you have a flash plugin installed?
[08:13] <trece8> Kartagis, because you are using swfdec
[08:13] <trece8> swfdec puts that button, nothing abnormal there
[08:13] <drbobb> GnosticAscension: dumpster diving? ;)
[08:13] <Pandora> #vuze
[08:13] <Kartagis> MarkJones, yes
[08:14] <MarkJones> Kartagis: adobe.com download the official plugin for flash its pretty good.
[08:14] <trece8> MarkJones, the one he has works... I have it
[08:14] <Kartagis> trece8, what do I need to use?
