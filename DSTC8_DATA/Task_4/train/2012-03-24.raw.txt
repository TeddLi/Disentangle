[20:03] <escott> sikilpaake, ok hmmm not sure then usually the other modules that depend upon it appear there
[20:03] <sikilpaake> escott: could it be process 2?
[20:03] <mmarc__> ikonia: I'm build my own compiler variation and need to know what option to use to set the proper search paths for crti.o and crt1.o
[20:03] <ikonia> mmarc__: are you aware of the pitfalls and issues that can be caused by having your own compiler on the same machine as the ubuntu one ?

[20:03] <mithrop> hi here
[20:03] <escott> sikilpaake, no it means that two things are using it. not sure what those two things could be if they aren't modules
[20:04] <mmarc__> ikonia: I'm not using ubuntu one
[20:04] <sikilpaake> escott: programs?
[20:04] <sikilpaake> escott: i'm closing ff
[20:04] <MrHanjrah> s/one/on
[20:04] <khat> blocked near 100 so far
[20:04] <escott> sikilpaake, it might be counting open file descriptors on devices created by that moduel
[20:04] <jack_sparrow> khat most routers as well are easy to setup for that
[20:04] <ikonia> mmarc__: so why do you need the ubuntu compile options ?
[20:04] <sikilpaake> escott: f*** it, i'm rebooting
[20:04] <ikonia> sikilpaake: no need for that language
[20:05] <escott> sikilpaake, that was the correct answer :) figured you would get there eventually
[20:05] <sikilpaake> ikonia: i'm not allowed to say "frop"?
[20:05] <mmarc__> ikonia: I'd like to look how search paths are specified there and study from it. Could you please be more specific about looking into the source? I did apt-get source gcc, but no configure options are in there... As far as I can see.
[20:05] <ikonia> sikilpaake: look - you know that's not what you where saying, that's why you starred it out, please don't do it in future

[20:05] <Fodi69> hi, I have a strange bug, which logs me out without any visible reason, my unsaved changes are gone, and I have to log in again. how can I investigate, what is the error and/or which package generates it?
[20:05] <sikilpaake> ikonia: gotcha ;) my bad
[20:05] <ikonia> mmarc__: they are in the control file
[20:06] <MrHanjrah> damnnn the F word is strictly prohibited here, although everyone use it in real life :P
[20:06] <ikonia> MrHanjrah: enough
[20:06] <jack_sparrow> not everyone
[20:06] <sikilpaake> escott: lol
[20:06] <sikilpaake> escott: yeah, its easier
[20:06] <MrHanjrah> ikonia: oopsie daisies, sorry
[20:07] <mmarc__> ikonia: this is not right, control files only contain descriptions. I think discussion is getting longer than I expect, you probably don't know exactly. Thanks, I'll search elsewhere.
[20:08] <ikonia> mmarc__: it should reference the options,

[20:41] <Guest14310> i need help
[20:41] <mirko1> TheCyberShocker: /dev/sdb is the whole physical disk, you need to give the partition number like /dev/sdb1
[20:41] <TheCyberShocker> Tried that also, but it says the directory is not found.
[20:41] <jack_sparrow> TheCyberShocker, each partition has a mount point
[20:42] <MrHanjrah> TheCyberShocker: plug out the device, plug it in again and do: dmesg | tail in terminal

[20:44] <Jordan_U> TheCyberShocker: Please also pastebin your /etc/fstab.

[20:44] <MrHanjrah> TheCyberShocker: and yes, what Jordan_U said :) would also help
[20:44] <ssfdre38> Guest14310, sudo do-release-upgrade
[20:44] <jack_sparrow> Guest14310, from 8 I would do a fresh install of 10.04
[20:45] <TheCyberShocker> http://pastebin.com/9cqpngxh
[20:45] <MrHanjrah> TheCyberShocker: its /dev/sdb5
[20:45] <TheCyberShocker> Ignore the "# /etc/fstab from command line:" it's just there to split the two commands up
[20:45] <research4oscar> I installed ununtu on an old old system, and just got ubuntu desktop working. If I want to setup my machine so that I can ftp into it. do i need to configure my wireless router or my ubuntu installation?
[20:46] <TheCyberShocker> Oh LOL ok let me try that
[20:46] <Guest14310> it says something about repositories
[20:46] <MrHanjrah> TheCyberShocker: sudo mount /dev/sdb5 /mnt/whatever/is/in/there
[20:46] <mirko1> TheCyberShocker: so sdb into sdb5 in fstab,a nd make sure /media/external exists
[20:46] <ssfdre38> research4oscar, did you install an FTP Deamon yet?
[20:46] <escott> TheCyberShocker, you probably dont want defaults on an ntfs-3g
[20:46] <escott> TheCyberShocker, at a minimum you want noexec,nosuid
[20:47] <TheCyberShocker> Oh ok, just followed a guide to tell me to use defaults or something. :) but yes it's mounted now, so that all worked.
[20:47] <research4oscar> is that the same as ope ssh server?
[20:48] <TheCyberShocker> Well looks like not all the files are there, oddly.
[20:48] <Jordan_U> TheCyberShocker: Device names can change, what is now "sdb" could be "sdc" another day. You should use UUIDs in your /etc/fstab
[20:48] <TheCyberShocker> How would I go about doing that Jordan_U? Still pretty new at this stuff.
[20:48] <jack_sparrow> !uuid
[20:48] <ubottu> To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in a !shell: <unconvertable> sudo blkid <unconvertable> (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[20:49] <research4oscar> I ask because under the software to install i have basic ubuntu server, openssh server, lamp, ubuntu desktop.
[20:49] <mirko1> Jordan_U, TheCyberShocker: my personal opinion: use labels instead of UUIDs
[20:49] <ssfdre38> research4oscar, no just eater use pure-ftpd or proftpd and its apt-get install pure-ftpd or apt-get install proftpd
[20:49] <Jordan_U> !fstab | TheCyberShocker
[20:49] <ubottu> TheCyberShocker: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[20:49] <maxflax>  What module name should I be looking for if I want to see if my broadcom wifi Prop is loaded? my card is a BCM43224

[21:07] <jonnyXer0> i usually c/p it lol

[21:11] <ubottu> rocky_: webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. It is not compatible with the way that Ubuntu packages handle configuration files, and is likely to cause unexpected issues with your system.

[21:30] <Frozen_byte> exit
[21:31] <research4oscar> i want to run a small website from my ubuntu installation.
[21:31] <research4oscar> I already have some files i would like to move.
[21:31] <research4oscar> from my laptop on to my new ubuntu/lamp installation.
[21:32] <Prabz> i1, you could use ".themes" folder in home folder itself. If you're in nautilus, press Ctrl+H to see it
[21:32] <mirko1> i1: by executing the extraction program (file-roller?) as root (the super user), but if you only want to install the theme for you, not for all users, just extract it into the directory /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.themes
[21:32] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: what help do you need?
[21:32] <research4oscar> I also installed ubuntu desktop.
[21:32] <gantry> I think I need to reinstall the bluetooth and wireless network components, as mine stopped working when I did an update.  What are the components that I need to install?
=== Richard_Cavell_ is now known as Richard_Cavell
[21:32] <research4oscar> I don't know how to transfer files from my laptop on to my ubuntu machine.
[21:33] <SilverLion> research4oscar, try dropbox ;)
[21:33] <Prabz> research4oscar, could you not use an external hard drive?
[21:33] <SilfenX> installed gnome-core and access it using vnc but desktop is extremely basic. I d like it to have a network manager for example so that I wouldnt have to rely on webmin to setup vpn etc. What should I add to gnome-core (not a regular desktop manager) to acheive this if possible?
[21:33] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: what system is your laptop running? windows?
[21:33] <research4oscar> yes.
[21:33] <SilfenX> seen there are something called core-extras but cant figure out what the metapackage name would be or indeed if it would solve my problem
[21:33] <marxjohnson> do you have SSH enabled on the ubuntu machine?
[21:34] <rocky_> Could anyone sugget a good alternative for webmin for my latest version of ubuntu ?
[21:34] <rocky_> suggest*
[21:34] <research4oscar> i do beleive i have ssh enabled.
[21:34] <marxjohnson> you can use WinSCP to copy files over ssh
[21:35] <research4oscar> okay i have winscp installed let me try transferring files.
[21:35] <Prabz> or plain old samba
[21:35] <hamed_shahien> hi every body when i create a database or a table in phpmyadmin i must choose charset and collation . could i make utf8_general_ci is a default value in creating database and tables????
[21:35] <research4oscar> marxjohnson: i don't know what credentials to use?
[21:36] <aifnord> I just installed Ubuntu 11.10, and in my previous install I had Alt+section () as a keybinding for starting a terminal, but in Unity/Compiz this key combination brings up some kind of overview-thingie similar to alt+tab (http://i44.tinypic.com/ol5rn.png)
[21:36] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: the same you use to log in
[21:36] <research4oscar> okay got it.
[21:36] <gantry> does anyone know which packages I need to re-install to get my wireless network working again?
[21:36] <aifnord> do any of you know what this monstrosity is called and how to disable it? i want alt+section for starting a terminal like I'm used to
[21:37] <BlackBomb> My desktop is a x86-based Intel, which ubuntu should i run? 64 or 32?
[21:37] <Prabz> aifnord, try disabling the keybinding in compiz
[21:37] <Oer> aifnord, ctrl + alt + T
[21:37] <rocky_> Could anyone suggest a good alternative for webmin for my latest version of ubuntu ?
[21:38] <Prabz> BlackBomb, what processor? If you've purchased it quite recently, 64 bit would also run
[21:38] <marxjohnson> BlackBomb: what processor does it have?
[21:38] <aifnord> Prabz: I'm trying to, but I can't find it anywhere
[21:38] <aifnord> Prabz: I figured if I knew what it was called I could google which plugin the binding is defined it
[21:38] <research4oscar> marxjohnson: how do i know if i have ssh enabled.  I did install openssh server along with lamp
[21:38] <aifnord> s/it/in/
[21:38] <BlackBomb> It has a Core (TM)2 Duo CPU E8500
[21:39] <BlackBomb> purchased about 2 1/2 years ago?
[21:39] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: if you install openssh it'll be enabled
[21:39] <MrHanjrah> rocky_: http://serverfault.com/questions/249973/what-is-a-good-alternative-to-webmin-for-dedicated-server-management or http://alternativeto.net/software/webmin/
[21:39] <Prabz> BlackBomb, C2Duo works with 64 bit
[21:39] <MrHanjrah> damn its 5 am o.0
[21:39] <Prabz> in fact, it is amd64 architecture
[21:40] <BlackBomb> awesome
[21:40] <MrHanjrah> nighty nite people
[21:40] <mirko1> BlackBomb: i still advice to use 32bit unless you a) know that there are working 64bit drivers for all your hardware and b) you don't need all the 16+ GB of RAM (or wherever the RAM limit for PAE was).
[21:40] <BlackBomb> Thanks
[21:40] <Prabz> aifnord, it's called unity application switcher
[21:40] <marxjohnson> you can double check by logging in and running sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
[21:40] <SilfenX> does anyone know what I would need to install on top of gnome-core to be able to get a working GUI version of networkmanager?
[21:40] <hamed_shahien> i want to ask about mysql is any room talking about this ????
[21:40] <kantlivelong> anyone know why my sound gets messed up sometimes? like if i hit tab a few times in console it gets distorted
[21:40] <galamar> how can I get the name of one of the #backtrack-linux ops?
[21:41] <galamar> Hello. btw.
[21:41] <Prabz> SilfenX, tried networkmanager?
[21:41] <Cpudan80> /msg chanserv access #backtrack-linux list
[21:41] <kantlivelong> rocky_: learn the console and youll never need webmin :)
[21:41] <aifnord> Prabz: hmm, I've disabled "key to start the switcher" in the unity compiz plugin, how come it pops up anyway?
[21:41] <Prabz> SilfenX, nm-applet
[21:41] <SilfenX> Prabz: yes, but it wont show up in my virtual desktop (vnc)
[21:42] <kantlivelong> rocky_: but  cpanel is always nice.. not free tho
[21:42] <BlackBomb> mirkol: Yeah Im running 64 bit on my laptop and i seem to have a hard time getting my ATI graphics card working properly lol. I was told to run the open source driver
[21:42] <SilfenX> Prabz: I assume it ought to show up next to the clock, in the notification area?
[21:42] <galamar> thanks.
[21:42] <Prabz> SilfenX, yes, that's where
[21:43] <Prabz> aifnord, what exactly is your "section" key? what keyboard layout?
[21:44] <i1> Mirko1: Here's The Deal Okay, I've Downloaded The Theme From DeviantArt And Extracted The File That Was In My Downloads Then Tried To Copy The Folder Into The Usr/Share And Themes Folder But Says That I Can't Because I Don't Have Permissions To Create It Says That While Copying It To The Themes Folder.
[21:45] <aifnord> Prabz: it's the <unconvertable> -key (above tab and below escape on my keyboard), xev says the keysym is "section"
[21:45] <Prabz> i1, that's true. you will not have permission to create it there. instead copy it  in /home/.local/themes
[21:45] <mirko1> i1: please don't capitalze all words, makes your posts hard to read. post all down-case or in proper case if you have the patience.
[21:46] <rocky_> !vsftpd
[21:46] <i1> Mirko1: Okay no problem.
[21:46] <research4oscar> I created a helloworld file in my desktop ubuntu's public folder.  I can view the file from my laptop by hitting the internal ip address.  however when i connecting to the internal ip address using ipconfig, i get a time out error.
[21:46] <mirko1> now, you cannot write anything to /usr/share/* because you're not root (admin user is not the super user). as I said, extract  it into your personal .themes directory
[21:46] <research4oscar> I can see that openssh has been installed.
[21:46] <ccallahan> Well, I have a awkward situation. I just installed 11.10 with Wubi. I have a sound card that shows up in alsamixer, but Pulse does not see it.
[21:47] <ccallahan> Any thought on how to fix it?
[21:47] <i1> Prabz: Question? how would I be able to copy it in home/local/themes
[21:47] <Prabz> aifnord, Is your keyboard layout correct? Seems that your system is swapping "section"  and "TAB".
[21:47] <mirko1> i1: sorry, missed the i1: look at my last reply
[21:47] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: what do you mean by "connecting to the internal ip address using ipconfig"?
[21:48] <Prabz> I1, it's "/home/<username>/.local/themes
[21:48] <jack_sparrow> il remember the .local  is hidden
[21:48] <rocky_> ok i really dont understand why i cant install packages and i know this one exist because i did it yesterday on another machine some one please help http://paste.ubuntu.com/898437/
[21:48] <ccallahan> rocky_: Did you try running a "apt-get update"?
[21:49] <rocky_> no let me try
[21:49] <ccallahan> Once aptitude is done rebuilding the cache, try the apt-get again.
[21:49] <aifnord> Prabz: hmm, I think so, it seems to work fine and both tab and the "section" keys produce expected results when pressing them
[21:50] <ccallahan> as in, apt-get install vsftpd
[21:50] <i1> Prabz: Thanks for the help.
[21:50] <i1> Mirko1: Thanks too mirko
[21:50] <rocky_> ccallahan thanks ill let you know what happens
[21:50] <Prabz> i1, Glad to help
[21:50] <ccallahan> Anyways, anyone have a idea yet in my case?
[21:51] <rocky_> ccallahan omg thanks i was going fliping nutz
[21:51] <ccallahan> np
[21:53] <ccallahan> Wow. I don't think I have ever seen #ubuntu this quiet.
[21:53] <Seveas> ccallahan, sst, they might hear you
[21:53] <ccallahan> heh
[21:54] <jack_sparrow> ccallahan, the beauty of unity
[21:54] <jack_sparrow> it works so well no one needs help
[21:55] <Prabz> jack_sparrow, lol
[21:55] <Seveas> ccallahan, if pulse doesn't see your soundcard, maybe some other application is hogging it? Try fuser /dev/snd/*
[21:55] <research4oscar> any recommendations on some good reading to getting started with ubuntu environment for web development.  I found the following article: https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/openssh-server.html
[21:56] <SilfenX> Prabz: I ve tried installing network-manager via synaptic but it never shows up in the notification area. I have to start it from the system menu and it seem it s just an empty shell cust it shows no connections and whatever I add to it seem to have no effect what so ever
[21:56] <Seveas> research4oscar, install an httpd and whatever software you want to use as web framework
[21:56] <maxflax>  What module name should I be looking for if I want to see if my broadcom wifi Prop is loaded? my card is a BCM43224
[21:56] <maxflax>  What module name should I be looking for if I want to see if my broadcom wifi restricted is loaded? my card is a BCM43224
[21:56] <research4oscar> I have lamp installed along with bluefish ide.
[21:57] <Seveas> SilfenX, the thing in the notification area is not networkmanager, but nm-applet. Part of network-manager-gnome
[21:57] <Prabz> SilfenX, what version of ubuntu
[21:57] <SilfenX> lucid, 10.04
[21:57] <Prabz> SilfenX, See my earlier reply.. nm-applet
[21:57] <research4oscar> however i am new to setting up my port 80 and 22 to be able to transfer files from my laptop when I am not home using an ftp client.
[21:58] <ccallahan> Seveas: Assuming I am reading this right, no one is using the sound devices. I'm going to go ahead and pastebin it though just in case.
[21:58] <angs> what does this command do ". /usr/local/angstrom/arm/environment-setup"
[21:58] <SilfenX> oh, I ll tinker with that then see if anything changes - cheers
[21:58] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: are you trying to make the server accessible via the internet, not just your home LAN>
[21:58] <marxjohnson> ?
[21:59] <Seveas> angs the "." there means "read and execute this shell script in the current shell"
[21:59] <angs> Seveas: thank you
[21:59] <Seveas> angs, as if you would type all the commands in environment-setup directly
[21:59] <research4oscar> maxjohnshon: yes that would be ideal. but even it i can just get winscp working that would be okay for now.
[22:01] <ccallahan> Seveas: Here is the pastebin: http://pastebin.ca/2131858
[22:01] <Seveas> ccallahan, yeah, something is using it
[22:01] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: Hold on, you seem to be asking about 2 completely different things, so let's take one at a time
[22:01] <Seveas> ccallahan, ps aux | grep 7539
[22:02] <ccallahan> Oh! That's a pid!
[22:02] <ccallahan> Okay
[22:02] <Seveas> yeah, it's a pid :)
[22:02] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: Your Ubuntu server and windows PC are within your home LAN, am I correct?
[22:02] <research4oscar> matxjohnson: sorry about that. lets start with just being able to transfer files from my windows laptop to my ubuntu desktop from within my LAN
[22:02] <marxjohnson> ok cool
[22:02] <research4oscar> yes.
[22:03] <ccallahan> The pid belongs to Pulse. Should I restart the service?
[22:03] <marxjohnson> do you have PuTTY on your windows box?
[22:03] <research4oscar> yes.
[22:03] <marxjohnson> can you log in to your Ubuntu box with PuTTY?
[22:03] <Seveas> ccallahan, given that it doesn't seem to do much now, thay may not be a bad idea
[22:03] <research4oscar> i'll try now.
[22:05] <ccallahan> I add "&" to the end of a command to daemonize it, right? (Sorry, been a year or two since I have used Linux)
[22:05] <SilfenX> woudl anyone why I get this message? "update-rc.d: warning: /etc/init.d/StartVNC.sh missing LSB information"
[22:05] <SilfenX> *know
[22:05] <Seveas> ccallahan, ehm, why not do /etc/init.d/pulseaudio restart :)
[22:06] <Seveas> SilfenX, yeah, it's missing LSB headers. Look at the top of another file in /etc/init.d to see what they are
[22:06] <iZoz> www.alzubi.net
[22:06] <iZoz> www.alzubi.net/samasdood.html
[22:06] <iZoz> www.alzubi.net/openletter.html
[22:06] <iZoz> www.partyofthefree.org
[22:06] <FloodBot1> iZoz: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[22:06] <ccallahan> Seveas: Says it's configured for per-user sessions.
[22:06] <Seveas> ccallahan, ehm, duh, yeah I'm stupid :)
[22:06] <research4oscar> marxJohnson: success!
[22:06] <research4oscar> I was able to login using putty.
[22:07] <Seveas> in that case the & trick works
[22:07] <mirko1> As a Ubuntu/Linux online supporter, I sooner or later have to get familar with the Gnome3 gnome-shell/Unity stuff (I actually don't want to, sigh and grump). Since both need 3D acceleration, I just can't run it in VBox. Any hints from people in a similar situation
[22:07] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: right, that means the SSH service is running, you should also be able to log in via  WinSCP using the same credentials
[22:09] <ccallahan> Seveas: There we go.
[22:09] <ccallahan> Now she is working
[22:09] <research4oscar> marxjohnson: i will try it again.
[22:10] <ccallahan> Now, do I need to file a ticket or should I wait to see if it does this again when I reboot?
[22:10] <Seveas> ccallahan, the latter.
[22:10] <ccallahan> I figured
[22:10] <ccallahan> Thanks!
[22:10] <research4oscar> marxjohnson: you are right. i had the ip address wrong.
[22:11] <research4oscar> I will try and transfer some files.
[22:13] <SilfenX> okay, this is my startvnc.sh script.( http://pastebin.com/4EhUaUJB ) Could someone tell me how it should look to avoid getting warnings about it not having proper LSB info?
[22:13] <jimi_c> I'm trying to netboot 11.10, and i'm specifying "auto url=http://..." but it's not trying to pull down the preseed at all. I've checked the url is right and I don't see any errors in my httpd log, anyone have any ideas?
[22:13] <williammanda> If a rules is created using gufw / ufw...is a iptables rule also created?
[22:13] <ccallahan> Seveas: Sorry to bother you again, but now it seems Pulse is not letting other devices access the audio stream. Everytime I start a Skype call, it says it can't capture the audio.
[22:14] <research4oscar> marxjohnson: i get a permission denied.  I got this same message when I created a file on my ubuntu desktop and tried moving it to my /var/www/
[22:14] <cuddylier> Hello
[22:14] <research4oscar> if i create the file using the command line using vi it creates my html/php with no problems
[22:15] <cuddylier> I have a problem with my account "Ryan", It has no permission to access the "home" folder or install any programs via sudo command
[22:15] <research4oscar> however if i create it on the desktop and try moving the files over to /var/www it gives me a permission denied error.
[22:15] <skel> cuddylier: do you have another account that you have sudo access with?
[22:15] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: you need to make sure you're logging in to WinSCP as a user who can write to /var/www
[22:15] <cuddylier> Yes, root
[22:15] <cuddylier> skel, yes root
[22:16] <skel> cuddylier: I'd check to see if ryan is part of the admin group
[22:16] <skel> cuddylier: and also see if his home dir is owned by him
[22:16] <cuddylier> How?
[22:16] <cuddylier> I'm a total n00b at ubuntu
[22:16] <bastidrazor> cuddylier: ubuntu does not have a root account.
[22:17] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: id <username>
[22:17] <skel> cuddylier: groups <id> will work too
[22:17] <mirko1> SilfenX: don't get any LSB related messages on 10.04, what Ubuntu version do you use and pastebin the exact output
[22:17] <cuddylier> groups=1000 (ryan)
[22:17] <research4oscar> i only have one user on my ubuntu machine. it is the same one i use to create the html files except i use the word sudo in front of the command vi
[22:17] <Cache_Money> does anyone use Jupiter?  I'm having trouble with a fan running all the time.  I was told I could use Jupiter to throttle the CPU back
[22:18] <skel> cuddylier: so as root, if you want them to have sudo access, do usermod -g admin ryan
[22:18] <BLZbubba> hello there, i'm trying precise & unity - is there a way to hide the panel?
[22:18] <SilfenX> mirkol: ok, give ma few minutes
[22:18] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: using sudo means you're creating the file as root
[22:18] <skel> cuddylier: then if you do groups ryan again you should see admin in the list
[22:18] <cuddylier> usermod: cannot lock /etc/passwd; try again later.
[22:18] <cuddylier> I get that error
[22:18] <jimi_c> or, as root, gpasswd -a admin ryan
[22:18] <skel> cuddylier: are you currently root?
[22:18] <marxjohnson> rather than your normal user which you're logging in as
[22:19] <jimi_c> gpasswd's a little nicer, since you don't have to worry about specifying all the groups or changing your default group
[22:19] <cuddylier> Yes I am root
[22:19] <llutz> cuddylier: skel you always want to use "usermod -aG .... "  if you miss the -a it will kick you from all other not listed groups
[22:19] <skel> cuddylier: try jimi_c's suggestion
[22:19] <target> hi
=== target is now known as Pikos
[22:19] <BLZbubba> or at least make the panel go under full screen applications
[22:19] <maxflax> when running sudo lshw -C network I get the wifi driver to be driver=brcmsmac and that can't be right since I've installed the STA in resticted right?
[22:19] <Pikos> hi
[22:19] <cuddylier> So, What do I type?
[22:20] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: gpasswd -a admin ryan
[22:20] <skel> llutz: ah ty, good to know
[22:20] <llutz> cuddylier: better to use " sudo adduser yourusername admin"
[22:20] <GhostConn> can someone suggest a better version of linux then ubuntu 11:10
[22:20] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: you'll need to change the permissions on /var/www so your normal user can write to it
[22:20] <research4oscar> marxjohnson: so do i need to assign my user special permission to that folder?
[22:20] <jimi_c> on old unix/linux, the -a option to usermod didn't exist
[22:20] <bastidrazor> GhostConn: 10.04
[22:20] <Pikos> I'd like to turn off samba on my laptop (KUBUNTU) do you know how to?
[22:20] <jimi_c> so gpasswd is what i use to this day :)
[22:20] <cuddylier> Adding user `ryan' to group `admin' ...
[22:20] <cuddylier> adduser: `/usr/bin/gpasswd -a ryan admin' returned error code 1. Exiting.
[22:20] <skel> GhostConn: if you can suggest to me a better fruit then strawberry
[22:20] <cuddylier> That error
[22:21] <Cache_Money> skel: Mango
[22:21] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: you did that backwards I think
[22:21] <SilfenX> Mirkol: here is my output about the LSB error: http://pastebin.com/gUKt8tTp
[22:21] <marxjohnson> research4oscar: look at the chmod and chown commands, you'll need to run them with sudo
[22:21] <jimi_c> oh no, nm you did it right
[22:21] <odinX> are there filesystems that are not almost the same, i mean like new concepts?
[22:21] <cuddylier> No, I did it in the correct order.
[22:22] <GhostConn> anything besides ubuntu lol ... ubuntu is the rotten bitter fruit of the bunch lol
[22:22] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: run this "getent group admin"
[22:22] <hamed_shahien> when i choose aday from calendar it open year 1970
[22:22] <research4oscar> marxjohnson: i will do that.
[22:22] <llutz> cuddylier: you need to that as user with sudo-access or root
[22:22] <cuddylier> I am in root
[22:22] <doug_> The Ubuntu sidebar is what caused me to remove it
[22:22] <skel> GhostConn: trolling won't get you far in here :) maybe if you were specific about what you're trying to avoid it'd help.
[22:22] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: run "id" with no options, what user does it say you are?
[22:22] <cuddylier> When I do "who" it days "root" is logged on
=== eon is now known as Guest74749
[22:23] <cuddylier> It says "uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)"
[22:23] <hamed_shahien> and in my other computer when i choose aday from calendar it don't open any thing
[22:23] <doug_> Is Opera better than Firefox?
[22:23] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: run "getenforce"
[22:24] <jimi_c> if it says "Enforcing", run "set enforce 0"
[22:24] <jimi_c> then retry the gpasswd command
[22:24] <marxjohnson> doug_: define "better"
[22:24] <skel> doug_: depends on what you value
[22:24] <jimi_c> sorry, "setenforce", no space
[22:24] <cuddylier> The program 'getenforce' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
[22:24] <doug_> Faster, more options, less RAM, etc.
[22:24] <graingert> how do I use seahorse to sign documents?
[22:25] <cuddylier> then E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
[22:25] <doug_> I'm having problems getting certain websites to load completely, mainly Facebook. The images of of others doest show up

[22:25] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: it seems like your system is not in a good state :/
[22:25] <doug_> plus I cant load the "Ask Ubuntu" website
[22:25] <cuddylier> What should I do with it, Jimi? :(
[22:25] <pangolin> cuddylier, run sudo dpkg --configure -a
[22:25] <mirko1> SilfenX: oh, that's a totatly different thing since you're trying to create a SysV startup scrip. does the script otherwise work? it's just a warning after all.
[22:25] <doug_> Xubuntu 11 seems to be the best fit for a Netbook
[22:25] <cuddylier> I am using xfce
[22:25] <marxjohnson> doug_: unless you're using a very old version of firefox, I doubt the browser is the root of the problem
[22:26] <cuddylier> It has like no features
[22:26] <cuddylier> How can I change it to have more features?
[22:26] <cuddylier> As it seems so basic things you are telling me doesn't work
[22:26] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: you can try and do what it says, to correct packaging issues. If this is a brand new install, you might want to try reinstalling
[22:26] <pangolin> cuddylier, open xterm and run the command: dpkg --configure -a
[22:26] <cuddylier> What is xterm?
[22:27] <SilfenX> mirkol: no, it s not working at all. After reboot there is no vnc session to connect to. It works inititating it manually via putty but not via the script. Seems it s bugging out or not getting run during boot
[22:27] <doug_> It does the same thing when I run Windows 7 so it's probably the connection
[22:27] <pangolin> !cli | cuddylier
[22:27] <ubottu> cuddylier: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal or type in it: man intro
[22:27] <jimi_c> @pangolin: he is root at a command prompt, so he should be good
[22:27] <maxflax> when running sudo lshw -C network I get the wifi driver to be driver=brcmsmac and that can't be right since I've installed the STA in resticted right?
[22:27] <pangolin> jimi_c, if he is root at the prompt he is not good at all.
[22:27] <GhostConn> I really don't care for the ubuntu side bar on the left as i use cairo dock... I dont mind it being there I just hate when i ave other applications open and if i go to close to it, it appears SOOOO ANNOYING !!! lol.. i have a black boot screen (minor)..I can't enable a network bridge with ubuntu... extremly hard to find help for ubuntu rather then say mint or fedora ect.. and for some reason ubuntu under clocks my amd bul
[22:27] <GhostConn> ldozer fx-8150 to 2.6ghz
[22:27] <jimi_c> @pangolin: that's a whole other issue :)
[22:27] <pangolin> jimi_c, it is an issue we do not support
[22:28] <cuddylier> Oh...my trash can says it can't find it when I delete a file
[22:28] <cuddylier> dpkg: error: failed to write status database record about 'python-aptdaemon' to '/var/lib/dpkg/status': No space left on device
[22:28] <jimi_c> @pangolin: his main user was not in the admin group - some things you do have to use root for, though how it ended up in that state is anyone's guess
[22:28] <skel> GhostConn: you don't have to use the unity interface. If you like you can switch to gnome 3 or 2
[22:28] <DJ> cuddylier, right, you ran out of Hard drive space
[22:28] <doug_> Cairo Dock f***** up Xubuntu so bad that I had to reinstall the entire OS. Dont use it
[22:28] <cuddylier> How do I delete the files?
[22:29] <cuddylier> It is a partion of 10gb on the root user

[22:29] <ubottu> doug_: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional.
[22:29] <skel> GhostConn: bridging will be the same in mint as it is in ubuntu since mint is based on ubuntu
[22:29] <mirko1> SilfenX: actually it was stupid by me to actually ask if it works, it can't work. init scrits have a required structure and you need to write a correct SysV init script. if you don't want that just call your script in /etc/init.d/rc.local
[22:29] <GhostConn> thats the least of my worries however I will try SKEL thanks,,   my biggest problem is my cpu

[22:30] <jimi_c> So, anyone familiar with netboot?
[22:30] <buntstift> for some reason I can't resize windows with alt + right mouse click/movement ...any idea?!
[22:30] <GhostConn> i have never had a problem before I think my cpu is just incompatible because its so new?
[22:30] <Steevca> Does anybody know a good software or an online app that i can put all my accounts (gmail,facebook,web hosting,etc.) and keep track of them and log in easy ?
[22:30] <skel> GhostConn: right but there are community packaged kernels different from the default that are optimized schedulers that some feel are better for desktop use
[22:30] <doug_> When I reset, I keep getting a list of programs stopped or start....One of them is a automatic crash report which is says failed to stop....what does this mean?
[22:31] <cuddylier> "Unable to find or create trash directory" It is on my desktop...
[22:31] <GhostConn> Ok ill take a look around for a kernel good for my cpu
[22:31] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: you'll have to delete files from the command line using the rm command - but be VERY careful what you delete
[22:31] <jimi_c> if you have stuff like ISOs or other big files i'd remove those to free up space
[22:32] <cuddylier> How would I delete a folder on my desktop?
[22:32] <cuddylier> In the command line &jimi
[22:32] <Seveas> cuddylier, rmdir ~/Desktop/"Name of folder"
[22:33] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: "rm -rf ~/Desktop/folder" <- BE VERY CAREFUL WITH "rm -rf"

[22:34] <SilfenX> mirko1: what should the line look like and where should it be placed inside rc.local?
[22:34] <jimi_c> you can see if gpasswd works now
[22:34] <Guest18193> guest18193

[22:36] <skel> what graingert said
[22:36] <cuddylier> What do I do now to get "ryan" root access to everything?
[22:36] <graingert> I think your admin can disable IMAP
[22:36] <Seveas> cuddylier, you don't.
[22:36] <pwb> ok I enabled pop3 thjats where I went wrong
[22:36] <cuddylier> Why not?
[22:36] <graingert> if they are "unpleasant people"
[22:36] <cuddylier> My root user only has 10gb and ryan has 1.7tb
[22:36] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: you can give sudo access by using the gpasswd command we gave you above
[22:36] <Seveas> cuddylier, because root is root and ryan is ryan.
[22:36] <jimi_c> "gpasswd -a ryan admin"
[22:37] <mirko1> SilfenX: sorry, it's /etc/rc.local at least on 10.04 and a simple call of the script before the exit 0 should be fin

[22:54] <mirko1> meerkats: not sure, files from an external drive?
[22:56] <meerkats> mirko1, no
[22:56] <mirko1> cuddylier: sure, your ryan account might be an "admin" account but it's not a "root" (super-user, master of all) account. you do not need access to /root normaly (and you shouldn't use it unless you know what you're doing)

[22:58] <cuddylier> Mirkol, Okay :D
[22:58] <Lunar_Lander_> my skype doesn't react anymore
[22:58] <Belial`> Lunar_Lander_, yes, it's called system monitor.
[22:58] <Laminator_> meerkats: Maybe a permission issue. Right-click on one of the files and check who has read/write permission
[22:58] <Lunar_Lander_> how can I access it?
[22:58] <meerkats> GB count reflects that the files have been erased
[22:59] <Belial`> Lunar_Lander_, press the super key (between the alt and fn key) and type "system monitor"
[22:59] <Belial`> assuming you're using unity.
[22:59] <Lunar_Lander_> yes
[23:00] <cuddylier> Also, What text editor is best to get and how do I install one?
[23:00] <Lunar_Lander_> it worked!!

[23:02] <mirko1> cuddylier: "what text editor" is like "what music". it's a*TOTALLY* personal thing. what do you need?
[23:02] <cuddylier> I need to edit text files
[23:02] <cuddylier> That's all
[23:02] <mirko1> cuddylier: gedit
[23:02] <Laminator_> cuddylier: If you're on Ubuntu, you have several

[23:04] <cuddylier> Not for me on my wonderful xfce
[23:04] <ActionParsnip> boroowa: what is the issue, please use one line and explain
[23:04] <cuddylier> How do I install leafpad? What's the command?
[23:04] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: then you will have mousepad in xfce
[23:04] <cuddylier> Let me look
[23:04] <Laminator_> cuddylier: mirko1 gave you one option, you can also open a terminal and type nano "filename.txt" or vi "filename.txt"
[23:05] <cuddylier> Oh.. okay..
=== GTAXL is now known as GTAXL[Away]
[23:05] <cuddylier> Yeah, I don't have mousepad

[23:05] <boroowa> hi guys
[23:05] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: you may want to run:  sudo ln -s `which mousepad` /usr/bin/gedit    to make using guides online easier (which normally assume gnome)

[23:06] <Lunar_Lander_> yea
[23:06] <mirko1> cuddylier: ah sorry, forgot that, well, there are more editors than sand in the sahara. mousepad, leafpad, gedit, etc, just search the packages, I I just could remember what editor xfce comes with
[23:06] <Lunar_Lander_> showed Skype using 200% CPU
[23:06] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: you can run:  sudo apt-get install leafpad   and get leafpad :()
[23:06] <Lunar_Lander_> clearly had locked up
[23:06] <Laminator_> Gedit is very nice though, and has great plugins available if you want to extend it. Hope you eventually find an editor that suits you best.

[23:18] <ActionParsnip> SusyLegs: just leave unpartitioned space and the installer will offer to use it, you don't need to make the partitions yourself
[23:18] <haydenhummel> Susy you don't need to. Ubiguity the installer used by Ubuntu does it all fo ryou. Just choose the option install byside windows.
[23:18] <i1> How do you get the wiggling feature whenever you move something in Ubuntu 11.10? Or did they remove that feature?
[23:19] <cuddylier> I didn't make any partions myself, my host did
[23:19] <cuddylier> One is 10gb and the other is 1.7tb
[23:19] <ActionParsnip> i1: wobbly windows can be enabled in ccsm
[23:19] <cuddylier> Since I added "ryan" to the admin group it switched partions
[23:19] <SusyLegs> haydenhummel: so I dont need to use a partition program to create partitions before installing Ubuntu alongside W7?  Will ubuntu create a second partitoon for me for Ubuntu and a third partitioon for swap?
[23:19] <i1> ActionParsnip: How Would I Do That?
[23:20] <ActionParsnip> i1: install compizcompiz-settings-manager   and you can run ccsm and enable it
[23:20] <haydenhummel> Yes. Ubuntu's install has an option to install along side Windows.
[23:20] <i1> ActionParsnip: Okay, thanks
[23:20] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: 10Gb for Ubuntu is plenty. You may also want a swap partition of equal size to your RAM

[23:21] <haydenhummel> SusyLegs: Yes it will.
[23:21] <SusyLegs> can I install the 64 bit Ubuntu even though W7 is 32 bit?
[23:21] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: No space left on device    guess what that means
[23:21] <hm_> ActionParsnip or somebody: could you help me with the libc error on lucid? What else would be needed to figure out what's wrong
[23:21] <haydenhummel> Depend if your computer is 64bit or not.

[23:22] <haydenhummel> Latest stable yes.
[23:23] <szal> 12.04 will take another month or so
[23:23] <haydenhummel> 12.04 is on BETA and stabel though. I'm suing it right now.
[23:23] <haydenhummel> *using
[23:23] <SusyLegs> Will Ubuntu Desktop version allow me to encrypt my personal programs and files?
[23:23]  * szal doubts that haydenhummel will get money out of it :P
[23:23] <cuddylier> When I use filezilla, it downloads the files to the "home directory"
[23:24] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: your partition for / is full. I suggest you uninstall some old kernels to free space, as well as uninstall any apps you don't use
[23:24] <zykotic10> cuddylier: your / 10G partition is full...
[23:24] <SusyLegs> haydenhummel: any ideas?
[23:24] <cryptotheslow> SusyLegs, yes the installer will give you the option to do that
[23:24] <haydenhummel> Yes. During install it provides an option to do so.
[23:24] <rasusto> use the alternate install disk
[23:24] <SusyLegs> Crypticfortune: coolies
[23:24] <SusyLegs> :)
[23:24] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: your home folder is also on the smae partition so clearing temp stuff may help here too
[23:24] <szal> 10G for / is a bit on the low sinde anyway
[23:24] <SusyLegs> rasusto: what the alternative ISO and how is it different from Deskstop?
[23:24] <ActionParsnip> szal: its fine for desktop use
[23:24] <cuddylier> How do I move it?
[23:24] <Star_Light> hello is there any channel here with wireless communications support?
[23:24] <cuddylier> I dont want the 10gb partion
[23:24] <cuddylier> I want to use the 1.7gb
=== Guest22560 is now known as Gunni
[23:24] <cuddylier> How do I move to it?
[23:25] <szal> ActionParsnip: if it tends to run full it isn't
[23:25] <ActionParsnip> szal: my / is 5Gb with all the bells and whistles you can need
[23:25] <cuddylier> And do you know how I change the folder filezilla downloads files to?
[23:25] <rasusto> SusyLegs: it is similar to the debian installer, it give you the option for full disk crypto
[23:25] <SusyLegs> how big swap partition will Ubuntu create?
[23:25] <haydenhummel> Anyone here know if I can use Portage (Emerge) in Ubuntu?
[23:25] <CatalanGuy> hi
[23:25] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: can you give a pastebin of the output of:  uname -a; dpkg -l | grep linux-image
[23:25] <angs> what is wrong with it? on what directory do I need to type the command? root@ubuntu:~/Desktop# ./configure --host=arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi --prefix=/home/vmplanet/gccexamples/nano/nano_out/
[23:25] <angs> bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
[23:25] <ActionParsnip> haydenhummel: there is apt-build which is similar, portege is Gentoo specific afaik
[23:25] <lewis1711> anyway I can remove the apt-get lock? I cannot find synaptic or apt-get in my process list at all
[23:25] <szal> cuddylier: lol, you change the folder in the left pane where you drag'n'drop the files to download
[23:26] <SusyLegs> rasusto: but if I encrypt the home folder using Deskstop version, wont that be good enough to keep people out?
[23:26] <zykotic10> !aptlock > lewis1711
[23:26] <ubottu> lewis1711, please see my private message
[23:26] <cuddylier> Dragging and dropping doesnt work
[23:26] <cryptotheslow> SusyLegs, I think the desktop installer gives the option for encrypting your home dir, think you may need the alternate CD to do the full LUKS disk thing
[23:26] <cuddylier> http://pastebin.com/yhwEsZC8
[23:26] <cuddylier> I've tried that already
[23:26] <SusyLegs> cryptotheslow:  but if I encrypt the home folder using Deskstop version, wont that be good enough to keep people out?
[23:26] <rasusto> SusyLegs: different programs can leave caches outside of the home folder. For maxiumum security, full disk is the only way to go
[23:26] <cuddylier> Unless I am dragging and dropping wrongly
[23:26] <Kage`> Anyone know off the top of their head how I can set iptables to block TCP connections with a window size of 65535?
[23:26] <haydenhummel> ActionParsnip: I know that. I've been using Ubuntu since 10.04. I'm just wondering if I can.
[23:27] <haux> When I enable crossover in ubuntu (It's actually AMD's "Dual Graphics"), ubuntu freezes on the load screen after restart. Any ideas on how to get this working?
[23:27] <Lunar_Lander_> rasusto, what happens when I select "encrypt my files" on the installer?
[23:27] <SusyLegs> where I get alternative ISO?
[23:27] <spline> e
[23:27] <haux> Sorry, I mean crossfire.
[23:27] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: and a pastebin of the output of:  cat /etc/lsb-release
[23:27] <rasusto> Lunar_Lander_: it encrypts the home folder only
[23:27] <research4oscar> I installed webmin under ubuntu. I anticipate I will be the only one using my webserver.  however can anyone recommend a basic user setup.
[23:27] <Lunar_Lander_> ah
[23:27] <Lunar_Lander_> is that good?
[23:27] <SusyLegs> is this the one I need? ubuntu-11.10-alternate-amd64.iso.torrent
[23:27] <Gurty> Monde de merde
[23:27] <ActionParsnip> research4oscar: webmin isn't appropriate for Ubuntu
[23:27] <lewis1711> zykotic10: thanks
[23:27] <research4oscar> mainly i am going to be using my ubuntu setup to work on different web projects.
[23:27] <haydenhummel> SusyLegs: Just use TrueCrypt
[23:28] <rasusto> SusyLegs: yes, assuming that is the architecture you need
[23:28] <ActionParsnip> !webmin | research4oscar
[23:28] <ubottu> research4oscar: webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. It is not compatible with the way that Ubuntu packages handle configuration files, and is likely to cause unexpected issues with your system.
[23:28] <cuddylier> http://pastebin.com/dgCE85sa
[23:28] <research4oscar> oh really, that sucks. it looked so nice.
[23:28] <Lunar_Lander_> thanks again people
[23:28] <SusyLegs> Ok im downloading ubuntu-11.10-alternate-amd64.iso.torrent rioght now :)
[23:28] <rasusto> Lunar_Lander: it protects sensitive files in the home partition, but it could be possible to recover all or part of that data from caches outside of the home folder or in the swap space
[23:29] <haydenhummel> Will Ubuntu ever natively offer Oracle/Sun Java?
[23:29] <szal> cuddylier: where did you get that kernel from?
[23:29] <SusyLegs> will alternative ISO install next to W7 and create dual boot menu?>
[23:29] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: you aren't using an official kernel
[23:29] <cuddylier> It is OVH kernal
[23:29] <cuddylier> My host
[23:29] <rasusto> SusyLegs: yes, but I beleive you have to do the partitioning yourself. It isn't as user friendly as the normal iso
[23:30] <haydenhummel> SusyLegs: Yes. Just chose the option to do so.
[23:30] <Jordan_U> SusyLegs: I would personally say that home directory encryption (alon with swap, which is what the installer does when you select home directory encryption) is all that's needed.
[23:30] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: I suggest you uninstall something like libreoffice etc, then install bleachbit and use it to clean space down
[23:30] <cuddylier> I want to switch partions though
[23:30] <research4oscar> so then i should setup my users manually?
[23:30] <cuddylier> I dont want the 10gb one
[23:30] <research4oscar> using the command line
[23:30] <cuddylier> 1.7tb is being wasted
[23:31] <Jordan_U> haydenhummel: SusyLegs: Truecrypt is not generally recommended because it's effectively non-Free and I don't think we can support it here.
[23:31] <SusyLegs> Jordan_U: but rasusto said different programs can leave caches outside of the home folder. For maxiumum security, full disk is the only way to go
[23:31] <ActionParsnip> cuddylier: you can move things over and symlink the folders I guess
[23:31] <cuddylier> How?
[23:32] <zykotic10> !movehome | cuddylier
[23:32] <ubottu> cuddylier: Your home directory is where all of your personal files are usually kept. For moving your home directory to a separate partition, please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving
[23:32] <cuddylier> My "home" folder has 1.7tb free
[23:32] <haydenhummel> Jordan_U: It's very useful though.
[23:32] <cuddylier> Yeah, it has all the free space
[23:33] <haux> When I enable crossfire in ubuntu (It's actually AMD's "Dual Graphics"), ubuntu freezes on the load screen after restart. Any ideas on how to get this working?
[23:33] <haydenhummel> SusyLegs: Why do you want your system to be this secure? Is it all not a bit over the top?
[23:33] <zykotic10> cuddylier: do you have much apt archives?  du -sh /var/cache/apt/archives
[23:33] <SusyLegs> im settling for Desktop as its more user friendly apparently.  Do I then select to encrypt home folder?
[23:34] <haydenhummel> SusyLegs: As we have all already said; yes.
[23:34] <cuddylier> 130M    /var/cache/apt/archives
[23:34] <SusyLegs> rasusto: you said some programs will leave caches outside of the home folder.   So how can I clean those caches?
[23:34] <SusyLegs> haydenhummel: ok hehe
[23:34] <haydenhummel> SusyLegs: BitBleach
[23:35] <SusyLegs> haydenhummel: just checking :)
[23:35] <grumpy_> hello all New to bash...can anyone tell me how to look at the following log file:" /tmp/vmware-root/setup-6733.log" I'm having issues trying to install wmware

[23:35] <SusyLegs> <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bitBleach
[23:36] <haydenhummel> Well somebody's new to OSS any way. How much does it cost :p
[23:36] <SusyLegs> haydenhummel: the Ubunti Bot knows nothing about Bitbleach
[23:36] <haydenhummel> It's free.
[23:36] <SusyLegs> haydenhummel: whats BitBleach and how does it work and what does it do and how much does it cost to buy?
[23:36] <SusyLegs> haydenhummel: whats BitBleach and how does it work and what does it do?
[23:36] <SusyLegs> and where do I get it?
[23:37] <zykotic10> cuddylier: what is using up your /? "cd /" then "du -sh * 2>/dev/null" will list all the subdirectories and there sizes
[23:37] <haydenhummel> SusyLegs: It clears up temp files such as cache memory. It's free and you can get it from the Ubuntu Software Cneter after you've installed Ubuntu.
[23:37] <SusyLegs> haydenhummel: well that takes care of the security issues, thanks :)

[23:41] <haydenhummel> quit()
[23:41] <cespare> it's not an argument to add-apt-repository
[23:42] <Seveas> pmjdebruijn, odd as that doesn't exist. Try upgrading

[23:45] <_Marcus> zykotic10: I was thinking that, but isn't that where when you turn on the computer, it goes directly to Ubuntu, not loading GRUB?

[23:49] <cuddylier> Really?

[23:55] <cuddylier> Because I want to drag things and actually use the server

[23:55] <mirko1> cuddylier: please unlearn the word "best". there's no such thing. it depends. and +1 Oscailt. if you hate the command line, don't operate a unix /whatever sort) system.

[23:57] <Oscailt> Well then GNOME, but serious that just an needless resource hog. It's not to hard to learn a few commands.
[23:58] <mirko1> cuddylier: Linux is a non-standard Unix system. For operating a Linux/Unix server you *do* need command line knowledge

[00:01] <cuddylier> I've spent all day trying to figure out what to do, as all the 10gb is used p
[00:02] <cuddylier> I need far more than 10gb
[00:02] <Oscailt> Well you'll need to get your provider to reinstall Ubuntu and tell them how you want it.
[00:02] <cuddylier> I'll see what I can do, I have a control panel
[00:02] <jimi_c> @twig11: fsck.<fstype>
[00:02] <jimi_c> so fsck.ext3 for an ext3 partition
[00:03] <cuddylier> Do I keep the "/" directory but install it on the "/home" one?
[00:03] <cuddylier> "/" partition I mean
[00:03] <Oscailt> cuddylier: what are you using this server for? The best distro for servers is CentoOS
[00:03] <jeremiah_> I have a finger print scanner in my laptop. can i get ubuntu to work with it?
[00:03] <cuddylier> I am hosting a bukkit server
[00:04] <cuddylier> Well, I want to use it to do that
[00:04] <Laminator_> cuddylier: This method has risks, but you can use gparted, or other partitionmanager to shrink the partition with your /home dir and then enlarge the on with / mounted on it.
[00:04] <Oscailt> Minecraft.
[00:04] <cuddylier> Would centos be better for bukkit servers?
[00:04] <cuddylier> Minecraft
[00:04] <Oscailt> Yes CentOS is best. In my view.
[00:04] <jeremiah_> Oscailt, minecraft is the best!
[00:04] <jimi_c> @cuddylier: do you have anything on this server yet? probably easiest just to blow it away and reinstall from scratch
[00:04] <cuddylier> Nah, nothing
[00:05] <jimi_c> 1 hour and you're done, no screwing around
[00:05] <faryshta> how do I install 11.10 on a USB?
[00:05] <zykotic10> !best | Oscailt CentOS whatever...
[00:05] <ubottu> Oscailt CentOS whatever...: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[00:06] <jeremiah_> I have a finger print scanner in my laptop. can i get ubuntu to work with it?
[00:06] <SilfenX> what is amiss if gparted doesnt provide me with a 'mount' option for a displayed partition? Documentation just says that if the option isnt shown, then gparted doesnt know where to mount the partition. WTH?!! Why cant it just ask me where I want it mounted ten ... bloody convoluted stuff this
[00:06] <Oscailt> ubottu: I did say my view, not that it is.
[00:06] <ubottu> Oscailt: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[00:07] <jimi_c> @SilfenX: add a line to /etc/fstab and gparted will know where to mount it :)
[00:07] <Oscailt> Love getting told off by a bot.
[00:08] <Kman> Hey
[00:08] <Kman> Is there a way to install Ubuntu server after having installed the desktop version?
[00:09] <jimi_c> @Kman: yes, uninstall packages :)
[00:09] <Kman> oh yeah, ive seen long technical guides about that
[00:09] <jimi_c> do that and change your default init level to 3 instead of 5
[00:09] <Kman> I just dont understand why the usb stick wont boot
[00:10] <jimi_c> old motherboard bios maybe? or maybe a bios option?
[00:10] <Kman> no, i just installed the desktop from a usb stick lol
[00:10] <drdo> Audio in skype isn't working (remote pulseaudio server). Does anyone have any clue why that might be?
[00:10] <drdo> It works fine for everything else
[00:10] <Fyodorovna> Kman, does the power on gui say press ? for boot menu?
[00:11] <SilfenX> are there any applications (not the bloody terminal) around to allow me to mount partitions/drives without having to resort to mucking around in fstab with nano ...
[00:11] <haux> When I enable crossfire in ubuntu (It's actually AMD's "Dual Graphics"), ubuntu freezes on the load screen after restart. Any ideas on how to get this working?
[00:11] <Oscailt> Silfex: GParted
[00:11] <SilfenX> ahem, see above
[00:11] <infest>  would anyone here know why the sudo dd command is not found when i try to install ubuntu on a usb stick for my macbook? i am using terminal from an external drive running the install disk. would it be because i'm not using os x that that command does not exist?
[00:11] <ActionParsnip> SilfenX: nautilus can do it too
[00:12] <ActionParsnip> infest: unetbootin is available for mac and can put the ISO on USB storages
[00:12] <Oscailt> haux: I don't think anyone here has your answer. Have you tried an internet search?
[00:13] <haux> Oscailt, that's typically what I do first.
[00:13] <SilfenX> ActionParsnip: where in nautilus can I locate the drives/partitions if they arent mounted?
[00:13] <mirko1> SilfenX: there are GUI front ends for fusermount, forgot how they are called, will you find them or should I search?
[00:13] <Oscailt> haux: I've seen you ask it a couple of times and not get a reply so I was just trying to offer some advice.
[00:13] <SilfenX> mirko1: thanks, I ll see if I can find that one
[00:14] <Rocky> !ircd
[00:14] <haux> Oscailt, I understand. I'll try giving AMD support a call, although I'm unsure that they offer support for Linux.
[00:15] <ActionParsnip> SilfenX: in the left panel
[00:15] <Oscailt> haux: AMD are normally very helpful.
[00:16] <ActionParsnip> haux: hybrid GPU is problematic in Linux
[00:16] <SilfenX> ActionParsnip: my left pane in Nautilus contain only 'root', 'Desktop', 'File System', 'Network' and 'Trash'
[00:16] <ActionParsnip> haux: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics
[00:16] <Rocky> Hey guys im in need of some help. im trying to set up a basic basic irc server. Ive been messing around with ircd-hybrid but i cant get it to allow connections from out side the network would anyone be able to assist, ive goggld but it seems all the results on setting up a irc server is just for internal
[00:16] <haux> Thank you
[00:16] <ActionParsnip> SilfenX: do you see the partitions in the output of: sudo fdisk -l
[00:17] <sacarlson> SilfenX: maybe try mountmanager  gui
[00:17] <SilfenX> ActionParsnip: yes, I do
[00:18] <jeremiah_> I have a finger print scanner in my laptop. can i get ubuntu to work with it?
[00:18] <haux> Is there any benefit to using fglrx over the opensource drivers?
[00:18] <sacarlson> Rocky: so it does work when seen from your local network?
[00:18] <ActionParsnip> SilfenX: if they are internal I'd add them to fstab personally, not sure otherwise
[00:18] <Rocky> yes
[00:19] <sacarlson> Rocky: did you setup port forwarding on your adsl router?
[00:19] <Rocky> sacarlson yes i have the ports forwarded
[00:19] <sacarlson> Rocky: and what port numbers might that be?
[00:20] <Rocky> sacarlson 6666-6667
[00:20] <sacarlson> Rocky: ok sounds good and how about dns then?
[00:21] <Rocky> sacarlson i use a zapto.org
[00:21] <jeremiah_> I have a finger print scanner in my laptop. can i get ubuntu to work with it?
[00:21] <twig11> jimi_c: okay, I've never used fsck before but I ran sudo fsck.ext4  /dev/sda5 and it's doing it's thing. It asked for permission to fix it and after I hit y it said "Group descriptor 0 checksum is invalid.  FIXED." (same line repeated all the way to 1064)
[00:21] <sacarlson> Rocky: ok so lets take a look then what's the address
[00:21] <twig11> Now it's saying "Free blocks count wrong for group #1 (31743, counted=10329).
[00:21] <twig11> Fix<y>? Should I be hitting yes for this?
[00:21] <Rocky> sacarlson from no-ip. i have a full working LAMP + FTP + SSH all pointing to this virtual machine
[00:22] <SilfenX> scarlson: WTH! mountmanager is russian by default :( Looks promising tho, but cant understand a thing of it ...
[00:22] <twig11> jimi_c: Understand I have no idea what I'm doing with fsck.
[00:22] <jeremiah_> can someone help?
[00:22] <sacarlson> Rocky: ok and the apache is already seen?
[00:22] <jimi_c> @twig11: yes, I typically do fsck -y so it just answers yes to everything but you can't ctrl+c it or you might end up with an invalid disk
[00:22] <Rocky> sacarlson blindfaith.zapto.org
[00:22] <jimi_c> i probably put too much faith in fsck, but i've repaired many ext3/4 partitions and haven't had an issue yet
[00:23] <twig11> jimi_c: I accidentally ctrl+c'd it twice trying to copy text for this chat without thinking. I just reissued the command and it seems to be continuing.
[00:24] <jimi_c> and noone really knows what fsck is doing except fs developers :D but if you have a bad partition it's about all you can do
[00:24] <Rocky> sacarlson im just confused @ what options in the config to change so it listens for outside connections
[00:24] <jimi_c> cross your fingers and fsck it :)
[00:24] <mornando> hi all! complete newbie here!
[00:24] <mornando> anyone know how to help me fix a graphics driver?
[00:24] <sacarlson> Rocky: you might check sudo netstat -pant ; to see that 6666 is listening on all address
[00:24] <twig11> jimi_c: holding down the "y" key and praying...
[00:25] <jeremiah_> HELLO????
[00:25] <maxflax> hello, How do I turn off the wifi power management so It does it at boot.
[00:25] <twig11> jimi_c: directories count wrong, free inodes count wrong... Just keep hitting yes?
[00:26] <mirko1> jimi_c: fsck does excactly what it's surposed to to (second letter, check alt.syrecovery or so) :-D
[00:26] <GhostConn> ok i just clocked my fx-8150 to 4.45gzh.. is there a way to make ubuntu stop decreasing my cpu speed?  I remember using linux mint I had the option to add a cpu frequency tab to my toolbar ? how would i do this with ubuntu
[00:26] <GhostConn> toolbar (gnomepannel)
[00:26] <ActionParsnip> maxflax: the module it uses may have the option to disable power management
[00:26] <jimi_c> @twig11: yep. I just did the same thing a few nights ago. Took an md raid set and dropped it in new hardware. Fedora was not happy when it booted up...
[00:27] <jimi_c> but after doing that it mounted fine and all my files seemed to be there
[00:27] <ActionParsnip> jeremiah_: run:  lsusb   see if its detected there, you can then use the 8 character hex ID to find guides
[00:27] <twig11> jimi_c: ***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED ***** now what's the quickest way to see if it worked?
[00:27] <Laminator_> jeremiah_: If it takes long to get an answer, then either no one has one, or you need to give more information. No need to get impatient.
[00:28] <maxflax> ActionParsnip, Yeah, I can easily turn it off with iwconfig eth0 power off but I want it in boot so I dont have to do it manually every time
[00:28] <jeremiah_> ActionParsnip,yes it sees one. what is the 8 character hex id?
[00:28] <jimi_c> @twig11: mount it up
[00:29] <ActionParsnip> jeremiah_: read the line
[00:29] <ActionParsnip> maxflax: add it in /etc/rc.local above the exit 0 line
[00:29] <jeremiah_> ActionParsnip,  which part? Bus 005 Device 003: ID 08ff:2580 AuthenTec, Inc. AES2501 Fingerprint Sensor
[00:30] <SilfenX> could anyone with an english version of mountmanager guide me to where you can change language in it s settings, if it has such an option
[00:30] <Laminator_> maxflax: you can use startup manager to add a custom startup command
[00:30] <hopohopo> What's a good text editor for gnome that allows you to do find/replace using regular expressions?
[00:31] <dustin_> sup everyone im running pinguy os wat yaw runnin
[00:31] <tonesfrommars> hopohopo: vim/ Gvim
[00:32] <dustin_> hopo a use gedit or leafpad
[00:32] <tonesfrommars> dustin_: maverick 10.10
[00:32] <Laminator_> hopohopo: Gedit, use CTRL + H for find/replace dialog
[00:32] <hopohopo> I don't think gedit lets you use regex though

[00:33] <twig11> jimi_c: looks good now, thanks so much for your help. Confession time. I think I also broke grub earlier by trying to repair this problem with...now I don't even remember the name of the utility because I installed it earlier on a non-persistent live-usb. Anyway, it now boots directly to Windows. How do I make sure grub is working before I reboot?
[00:33] <mornando> Im new and the log file doesnt mean much!
[00:33] <dustin_> yup
[00:33] <Laminator_> hopohopo: I use emacs, which also has the feature (and much much more), vim may also be good.
[00:33] <jimi_c> @twig11: "man grub-install"
[00:34] <jimi_c> i don't use it that often, so best to read the man page or google for the correct syntax
[00:34] <hopohopo> Laminator_: Is emacs gui or command line?
[00:34] <Laminator_> Both
[00:34] <hopohopo> oic

[00:34] <Laminator_> It has a GTK frontend

[00:37] <Laminator_> maxflax: Ow, hadn't thought of that...
[00:37] <maxflax> ActionParsnip, ok so putting "/sbin/iwconfig eth0 power off" in rc.local should do the trick?

[00:56] <infest> no i have not, but i downloaded it from the ubuntu website. is there still a chance it isn't official?

[00:56] <tonesfrommars> ActionParsnip: I thought unity was "inspired by" Gnome3, wasn't there some falling out between canonical and the Gnome people?
[00:56] <ActionParsnip> infest: its not to test officialness, its to make sure it hasn't been mangled in transit
[00:57] <ActionParsnip> tonesfrommars: no, it just uses Gnome3 libraries

[00:57] <DocPlatypus> okay. I'm going to try to remain respectful, but this problem is at the end of my rope. again, I can't upgrade stuff, because of this stupid multiarch crap that I got "upgraded" to without asking. For example: "dpkg: error processing libfreetype6 (--configure): / libfreetype6:amd64 2.4.4-2ubuntu1.2 cannot be configured because libfreetype6:i386 is in a different version (2.4.4-2ubuntu1.1)" -- how do I get rid of this unw
[00:57] <DocPlatypus> anted and problematic i386 version of the library?
[00:58] <ActionParsnip> DocPlatypus: you will need a deb to make the versions match
[00:59] <DocPlatypus> ActionParsnip: I do. I am trying to upgrade to the new version. aptitude gets done, runs dpkg, which sees the i386 version there and promptly takes a dump.
[00:59] <Laminator_> Namicod: You can also install hwinfo and then run "hwinfo --short --network". Gives you a simple and easy to read output.
[00:59] <DocPlatypus> I just want to get rid of the i386 version. "sudo aptitude remove libpng12-0:i386 libfreetype6:i386" does not work, btw.
[00:59] <DocPlatypus> and I've been under the impression it is supposed to.
[01:01] <Laminator_> Namicod: Sorry, scratch that, doesn't give you the vendor. Best run the command that was given earlier
[01:03] <DocPlatypus> only thing I can think to do: downgrade these packages back to the versions that aren't in oneiric-security
[01:03] <DocPlatypus> and then re-upgrade
[01:03] <multiHYP> i cannot in any way launch jetty silently: java -jar /opt/jetty/start.jar > /dev/null 2>&1 &
[01:03] <delinquentme_> hey all I'm trying to search recursively from my current dir for a file called blah.gemspec
[01:03] <multiHYP> it keeps throwing things in my terminal after launch
[01:03] <infest> ok the hashes have matched
[01:03] <delinquentme_> " find -name *.gemspec " only searches the current dir
[01:03] <delinquentme_> how recursive?
[01:04] <tonesfrommars> ActionParsnip: that's a good idea (Gnome classic), I wonder if it's lightweight, or just a duck-typing of unity...
[01:04] <DocPlatypus> I really need to make sure whoever made this decision gets a piece of my mind. multiarch has done nothing but make problems for me, if I wanted to run i386 packages, I'd install an emulator or buy old 32-bit hardware!!!
[01:05] <DocPlatypus> honestly... this is dangerously close to being as bad as some Microsoft foul-ups.
[01:07] <wdsnead> Can anyone out there help me resolve why I cannot open any folders under the Places menu, except for the Computer folder??? Ubuntu acts like it is opening the folder but nothing happens. I am using Ubuntu 10.10 and don't want to go to Unity at this time.

[01:10] <infest> other than the md5 hashes not matching, is there any other test i can do to ensure none of the information my usb is not mangled?
[01:11] <Mike9863> Nevermind I figured it out.
[01:12] <wdsnead> daftykins: been out to google and searched the issue and tried everything out there and none of it worked that is why I came here. Will go and search more. Thank you, daftykins.
[01:12] <mirko1> DocPlatypus: might be obvious, but there is nothing like multi-arch support, neither on linux nor on win or anything else.you  can always only count on luck that the drivers, libs and progs don't conflict. imho, if you think you need multi-arch support, then choose the lowest common denominator and that is usually classic 32bit. sorry for not providing anything more useful.
[01:12] <daftykins> wdsnead: no problem, sorry i can't be of any better help
[01:13] <DocPlatypus> mirko1: I want 64-bit. I want all this 32-bit shit gone (pardon my French). I thought I had it gone. but it's still there and now it is conflicting with a security upgrade.
[01:13] <ratcheer> DocPlatypus: I agree!

[01:22] <perlsyntax> Does anyone know how to get the intel 1030 to work in linux?
[01:22] <ActionParsnip> infest: try using torrents, the protocol adds extra checking
[01:22] <sacarlson> DocPlatypus: so I guess on my next install I should continue to install 32bit;  why do some people keep telling me that 64bit is ready?
[01:22] <ActionParsnip> perlsyntax: looks like one of those Centrino monstrositoes
[01:22] <DocPlatypus> sacarlson: 64-bit is fine. it's this multiarch support that throws the monkey wrench into things
=== Afterraff` is now known as Afteraffekt
[01:23] <perlsyntax> i was told it was supported by linux

[01:23] <ActionParsnip> perlsyntax: can you give a pastebin of the output of: sudo lshw -C network; lsb_release -a; uname -a; dmesg | grep iwlagn      Thanks
[01:23] <ActionParsnip> perlsyntax: it is
[01:23] <perlsyntax> cool
[01:23] <Jordan_U> infest: ActionParsnip: As far as I know, Unetbootin does not have any [U]EFI support. Most intel macs can only boot from USB via EFI, which means that you need an EFI based bootloader.
[01:23] <perlsyntax> wait to see if my ubunttu pick the wireless card up.
[01:24] <perlsyntax> i try the live cd with no luck.
[01:24] <perlsyntax> Does anyone know if dell laptop with a web cam work in linux?
[01:24] <Jordan_U> infest: If it's at all possible you'll save yourself a lot of trouble by booting from CD (specifically the +mac iso burned to a CD) though.
[01:24] <ActionParsnip> perlsyntax: if you can give the output of the command, I can advise
[01:25] <ActionParsnip> perlsyntax: dell make a vast range of systems, so asaying it's a dell tells us near zero
[01:25] <perlsyntax> i will soon my ubuntu install is install with my eth0 i will.:)
[01:25] <sacarlson> DocPlatypus: if everything is already compiled in 64bit why do you need multiarch?  is it to compile for others that need 32bit versions?
[01:25] <ActionParsnip> perlsyntax: get fully updated too, those centrino chips often ned the n speed disabling to work
[01:25] <DocPlatypus> sacarlson: that's just it. I don't need it. I don't want it. one of the upgrades/updates set me up for multiarch without my permission and against my wishes!!!
[01:26] <perlsyntax> thank i be back in abit
[01:26] <DocPlatypus> in addition to an egregious violation of the principle of least surprise, it is getting in the way of a security update.
[01:26] <ratcheer> Many software packages require multiarch support.
[01:26] <DocPlatypus> ratcheer: I'm not running any of them. so I don't want multiarch. I should not have it forced on me.
[01:27] <ratcheer> Well, no upgrade should have installed it unless some package required it.
[01:27] <DocPlatypus> this should not even be an issue. I should have been *asked* if I need this, and *warned* of the possible problem first.
[01:28] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: Can you pastebin the output of "aptitude why libpng12-0:i386"?
[01:28] <spursncowboys> I just got a apple emac g4. There is no os on the computer. I downloaded ubuntu 10.04 powerpc iso and put it in the cd tray. However when I put it on I get the normal folder with a question mark. Is there something I should push, like f2 for the pc?
[01:28] <spursncowboys> Hi everyone btw
[01:28] <ratcheer> Example: I run a 64-bit video driver on a 64-bit system. But, for some reason, the driver requires multiarch support.
[01:28] <ActionParsnip> spursncowboys: did you MD5 test the ISO?
[01:28] <Jordan_U> spursncowboys: Hold down the 'c' key at boot.
[01:28] <DocPlatypus> Jordan_U: it's one line, no pastebin required. "E: No package named "libpng12-0:i386" exists."
[01:30] <mcamaret> spursncowboys: I'm not sure holding c will work, it doesn't for me, so if you have to enter open firmware (cmd+shift+o+f on bootup) and run "boot cd:,\\:tbxi
[01:30] <sacarlson> spursncowboys: to install?  I think you need to reboot to get the cd to boot up
[01:30] <DocPlatypus> Jordan_U: BTW, not what I expected to see. and now I'm not sure what if anything will fix this.
[01:30] <mcamaret> "
[01:30] <spursncowboys> Jordan: thanks
[01:30] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: That's odd since the command works for me, and the package name 'libpng12-0:i386' is included in one of the error messages you posted. I don't know why that's happening.
[01:30] <mcamaret> make sure you use backslashes
[01:30] <Jordan_U> spursncowboys: You're welcome.
[01:31] <spursncowboys> sacarlson: ok Ill try that
[01:32] <spursncowboys> sacarlson: I rebooted it originally. I'll try it and brb
[01:32] <infest> yea i think i'll just boot from a disk. i just wanted to try an alternative to running from a disk because my motherboard got crazy hot when i did that, and i wanted to see if it'll run cooler using a usb.
[01:32] <mcamaret> when I try to launch gnome-documents (ubuntu 12.04) it doesn't open. from the command-line I get http://paste.ubuntu.com/898613/ for output.
[01:32] <mcamaret>  help
[01:32] <infest> thanks for the help though
[01:33] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: Can you pastebin the output of "sudo apt-get -f install"?
[01:34] <pmp6nl> Hello, my receiver can grab music from a computer if it has dlna, how do I make it so music on my ubuntu laptop can be pushed out? Thanks!
[01:34] <OY1R> can i get an alternative clock applet for ubuntu that shows local time and UTC at the same time ?
[01:34] <DocPlatypus> Jordan_U: http://paste.ubuntu.com/898621/
=== whoever is now known as costcosJarred
[01:35] <ratcheer> OY1R: Great question!
[01:36] <jswagner> pmp6nl: I can't guide you, but you're looking for a DLNA server.  surely there's something in the repositories.
[01:36] <OY1R> ratcheer, i tried adding a second clock applet but when i set it's time, both clocks change.
[01:36] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: "apt-cache policy libfreetype6:i386"?
[01:37] <DocPlatypus> Jordan_U: N: Unable to locate package libfreetype6:i386
[01:37] <pmp6nl> jswagner, Ok, I was looking through that.  I will give it a try, I just didnt know if anyone had experince with it. Thanks
[01:37] <FunGoat> Is the EFI situation still a bit of a roadblock to installing Ubuntu on a MacBook Pro?
[01:37] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: What about "apt-cache policy libfreetype6"?
[01:37] <DocPlatypus> Jordan_U: I have already taken the multiarch configuration for apt out, I thought I had gotten rid of all i386 cruft left. is that going to be an issue?
[01:38] <DocPlatypus> Jordan_U: http://paste.ubuntu.com/898625/
[01:38] <Jordan_U> FunGoat: Your best bet is to install Ubuntu using a CD (rather than USB) and the +mac iso. That way you will be using Apple's BIOS implementation and avoid most problems with EFI.
[01:39] <pmp6nl> mediatomb it is!
[01:39] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: If you removed the entries for the 1386 repositories without first checking that you didn't have any i386 packages already installed that would explain why you're in this situation now.
[01:39] <FunGoat> Jordan_U: What's the +mac iso? I've been attempting rEFIt without much luck.
[01:39] <DocPlatypus> Jordan_U: another reason the upgrade should never ass-ume I want multiarch when I don't.

[01:40] <mcamaret> where are the config files for footnote (elementary notes app) located?
[01:41] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: Your complaining is not constructive. Please stop.
[01:41] <DocPlatypus> Jordan_U: sorry. I'm guessing I need to re-add i386, upgrade these packages, then get rid of it again?
[01:41] <FunGoat> Jordan_U: Wow. How have I missed that for 10 months? Thanks for the input. I'll give it a shot.
[01:42] <DocPlatypus> if that's the only way to fix it, I will
[01:42] <Jordan_U> FunGoat: It's not well advertised :) You're welcome.
[01:42] <DocPlatypus> but this time, I want to be sure I have no i386 packages left
[01:42] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: Yes.
[01:42] <FunGoat> Jordan_U: Thanks! Very helpful.
[01:42] <ratcheer> OY1R: I had an app like that on Windows, I think it was called Syntime. No, that doesn't look right. It would display many different clocks at the same time. But, I don't run Windows anymore.
[01:49] <GhostConn> has anyone heard of torrentslam? its a plugin for transmisson that will auto download the latest 720p/1080p releases ?
[01:50] <mcamaret> GhostConn: that does not belong on #ubuntu, since transmission and piracy are completely cross-platform.
[01:51] <spursncowboys> Ok I tried the cmd, shift, and the two letter keys...no luck. then tried to hold down the c key...nothing. I've rebooted the emac g4 three times now.
[01:51] <DJ> spursncowboys, ask in #emacs
[01:51] <DocPlatypus> mcamaret: agreed in part, but please note that not all use of p2p is copyright infringement, and the infringement of copyright has zero to do with the robbing of ships on the high seas and many feel they should not be compared
[01:51] <GhostConn> ok but where better to ask then hear lol?
[01:52] <GhostConn> piracy is nto illegal in my eyes lol
[01:52] <GhostConn> nor the rest of the planet lol
[01:54] <mcamaret> spursncowboys: don't listen to DJ, hopefully you know better.
[01:54] <Oer> if piracy is legal, why did they call it piracy?
[01:55] <mcamaret> DocPlatypus: I did not say torrenting is illegal
[01:55] <xangua> !ot | Oer GhostConn
[01:55] <ubottu> Oer GhostConn: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[01:55] <DocPlatypus> anyway... I have multiarch support back in so I can get rid of this... how can I tell which libfreetype6 is which in aptitude now?
[01:56] <mcamaret> DJ: what does an apple emac have to do with gnu emacs?
[01:56] <DocPlatypus> it just shows two of them. and I have no idea which is which. I want to get rid of the i386 one
[01:56] <mskazmii> what is outlook alternative for exchange email for ubunut?
[01:56] <ActionParsnip> mskazmii: evolution
[01:56] <DJ> mcamaret, i though he meant emacs, now let's drop the Subject since is not an Ubuntu topic, ;)
[01:57] <mskazmii> yest but that is not the alternative it works with exchange as imap
[01:57] <ActionParsnip> mskazmii: so what do you need?
[01:57] <GhostConn> honestly who cares about piracy... millions upon millions of people do it by the millisecond lol...? how could something be illegal if we all do it? its a sharing community how should someone have the right to tell me if i purchased something that I can't borrow it or trade to a  friend
[01:57] <sacarlson> DocPlatypus: if it works with multiarch installed maybe it would be easier just to leave it installed?
[01:57] <Mike9863> Icons are showing on menus and buttons even though I have the options disabled under desktop -> gnome -> interface under gconf-editor. How can I disable these icons?
[01:58] <GhostConn> and my question was ubuntu related as it is a linux ubuntu app?
[01:58] <ActionParsnip> GhostConn: that is offtopic here
[01:58] <mskazmii> I am looking outlook alternative. Evolution is the limited alternative
[01:58] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: sudo apt-get remove packagename:i386
[01:58] <fernando_> ok I have bad sectors on drive C or drive sdb gparted says to make a full clone but I instead want to do a ntfsresize --bad-sectors which it's also recomending but when I do sudo ntfsresize --bad-sectors /dev/sdb I get an error saying "FAILED TO STARTUP VOLUME: invalid argument and other stuff I want to do know why
[01:58] <xangua> mskazmii: thunderbird is the default email client now
[01:58] <ActionParsnip> mskazmii: you are connecting to a proprietary piece of software which is doing all it can to keep non-microsoft clients out
[01:59] <ActionParsnip> mskazmii: evolution is as good as you are going to get under ubuntu
[01:59] <DocPlatypus> Jordan_U: that's "helpfully" offering to remove about 60 other packages along with it. and I can't tell if those are amd64 versions or i386 versions, since one of them is libc6 I'm going to hose my system if I'm wrong.
[01:59] <mskazmii> I do understand that but This is the only thing holding me back from switching from windows
[01:59] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: Please pastebin the complete output (including the command itself).
[01:59] <ActionParsnip> mskazmii: you may find joy with Thunderbird, but your choice of mail server has severely restricted your choice (just as Microsoft always do)
[01:59] <ratcheer> OY1R: It was Symm Time and it is from Symmetricom. But, it is only available for Windows.
[01:59] <ActionParsnip> mskazmii: use a different mail server, problem solved
[02:00] <mskazmii> ok what other mail server do you recomend that has close functionality as microsoft exchange?

[02:02] <mskazmii>  groupwis?
[02:02] <mskazmii> ok let me look into it
[02:02] <Jordan_U> DocPlatypus: 1: You can see the ':i386' at the end of the i386 packages and 2: You should get dpkg into a consistent state *first*.
[02:02] <mskazmii> thanks
[02:02] <DocPlatypus> ah
