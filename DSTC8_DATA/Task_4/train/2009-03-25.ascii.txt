[06:53] <gte351s> Titan8990: how can I change the password via the live cd for the new language? Probably the best thing is to set up a new user and password, but how to make it stick after the live cd reboot?
[06:53] <gte351s> n2diy: yeah, that's what I thought :D
[06:53] <Titan8990> gte351s, you have to chroot into your ubuntu drive for something like that
[06:54] <n2diy> bullgard4: thanks, Maybe I don't need a DB? Abiword might beable to use Gnumeric for mail merge?
[06:54] <Yossi> bsdunix: point taken :P
[06:54] <gte351s> Titan8990: should I mount the device or something?
[06:54] <ramontayag> hey all. i tried asking in the ubuntu forums but it seems people are asleep there :) i've got a compaq presario 1200 with a fresh install of xubuntu. i booted it up but the login screen is blank! i tried connecting an external monitor, and then restarted gnome, and then that's when the laptop shows the login screen. what should i do so I won't need to plugin a cable to make the laptop...
[06:54] <ramontayag> ...display something?
[06:54] <joljam> someone please help me.. I am not able to write to my dvd
[06:54] <Titan8990> gte351s, yes, it needs to be mounted

[06:55] <the99zChris>  hey would anyone know what i messed up in gnome(hardy) if my compiz shortcuts don't work anymore, my volume popup display looks def not as good, and it looks like i now have only 256 colors..??
[06:56] <abstortedminds> How do i make it so that my drives dont display on desktop
[06:56] <roccity_> the99zChris:you haven't changed your xorg file have you
[06:56] <eMaX> don't look at them
[06:57] <Titan8990> gte351s, now, assuming you mounted it to /media/ubuntu:    mount -t proc none /media/ubuntu/proc && mount -o bind /dev /media/ubuntu/dev && chroot /media/ubuntu /bin/bash && envupdate
[06:57] <Titan8990> gte351s, from a root shell: sudo -i
[06:57] <the99zChris> no, but i did run a couple lines of commands i didn't entirely understand in the terminal, would xorg be a good place to start lookin?
[06:58] <gte351s> Titan8990: I think I'm mounted from /media/disk - how do I find out?
[06:58] <roccity_> the99zChris: yeah check the depth that it is running at and the video driver I think you want at least 24 for the depth
[06:58] <the99zChris> but i'm pretty sure the problems were delayed a bit
=== matthew__ is now known as darkone778
[06:58] <Titan8990> gte351s, you have to specify a mount location when you mount....
[06:58] <bsdunix> call mount
[06:59] <Titan8990> gte351s, eg- sudo mount /dev/sdxx /media/ubuntu   <----mount location
[06:59] <the99zChris> sounds good thanks, u know how to get compiz hotkeys workin again? its running but not working if that makes sense
[06:59] <Titan8990> gte351s, but yes, mount alone will display where all devices are mounted
[06:59] <roccity_> the99zChris: what about in the screen resolution
[06:59] <n2diy> abstortedminds: right click on the desktop, and explore your options.
[06:59] <roccity_> the99zChris: what were the commands that you entered in a term
[07:00] <gte351s> Titan8990: I got /dev/sdb1 on /media/disk type vfat
[07:00] <Titan8990> gte351s, that doesn't sound right
[07:00] <the99zChris> to be honest i don't know, i copy/pasted which i'm now seriously regretting.. no screen resolution option from right click desktop though
[07:01] <Titan8990> gte351s, it should be a linux formatted drive, I would be very surprised if a linux install would even work on fat
[07:01] <the99zChris> and no option to change colors when i go to system>preferences>screen resolution
[07:01] <gte351s> Titan8990: here's what I get for running mount alone: http://pastie.org/426290
[07:02] <eMaX> the99zChris, graca?
[07:02] <the99zChris> graca?

[07:09] <sachin_> i think no ones interested here...
[07:09] <Titan8990> gte351s, you should check the files on it to make sure
[07:10] <gte351s> Titan8990: yeah, it has my home dir.
[07:10] <Titan8990> gte351s, mount -t proc none /media/ubuntu/proc && mount -o bind /dev /media/ubuntu/dev && chroot /media/ubuntu /bin/bash && envupdate
[07:11] <gte351s> Titan8990: what does all that do?
[07:11] <Titan8990> gte351s, mounts dynamic kernel files and device files to your ubuntu filesystem
[07:11] <n2diy> what is the terminal command to make your system beep?
[07:11] <Titan8990> gte351s, then in chroots into the filesystem
[07:11] <taz_> somethign wrong with my webcam???
[07:12] <taz_> my webcam logitech
[07:12] <Titan8990> gte351s, so your new terminal envirnment will be your ubuntu filesystem
[07:12] <gte351s> Titan8990: I get an error mount point /media/ubuntu/proc does not exist

[07:15] <gte351s> Titan8990: I think my root is in another partition now that I see where you're going. gimme a sec to mount it
[07:15] <Titan8990> gte351s, that is your /home partition
[07:15] <n2diy> what is the terminal command to make your system beep? I think it is "bell" but how do I tell bash it is a system command, and not a file?
[07:15] <Titan8990> gte351s, but wait
[07:15] <Titan8990> gte351s, if you have /home on its own partition, you should just reinstall
[07:15] <gte351s> Titan8990: thanks for sticking around, by the way
[07:16] <gte351s> Titan8990: really?.. wont it mess everything up?
[07:16] <Titan8990> gte351s, that is the benefit of having a /home partition, you can install any OS on the root partition but all your files and application settings stay because they are all stored in /home
[07:16] <Titan8990> gte351s, no, shouldn't
[07:16] <Titan8990> gte351s, just don't accidently reformat the /home partition
[07:16] <Titan8990> gte351s, and be sure to select it to be mounted at /home for the new install and your good to go
[07:16] <Ian00> how can i make apt-get to stop asking me about how much disk space will be used
[07:17] <gte351s> Titan8990: alright, I'll do that.
[07:17] <n2diy> Titan8990: but not your apps, you have to re-install those, unless I'm missing something?
[07:17] <gte351s> Titan8990: thanks a lot, if we ever meet - drinks are on me :D
[07:17] <Titan8990> n2diy, yes, applications need to be reinstalled but his settings for those application will remain

[07:19] <jway> how can I make my screen to the left my primary?
[07:19] <n2diy> Titan8990: roger that, not familiar with servers, bottom line is having a /home important.
[07:19] <Ian00> Titan8990 thank you
[07:19] <jway> the left screen will *always* be the one with menubar, taskbar and desktop icons
[07:21] <n2diy> is there a rule of thumb to determine the size of a /home partition per user?
[07:21] <Titan8990> n2diy, right, its best to keep the rootfs as isolated as possible
[07:21] <sprockets2000> anyone use the cpufreq scaling applet

[08:16] <MenZa> aneptun: The non-OSE version has  few more features, but alas, isn't open source.
[08:16] <iulianpojar> psypher246: look in the  logs and see who of the notebooks is giving you problems
[08:16] <Baconizer> meaning the OSE is better :P
[08:17] <psypher246> iulianpojar: any logs i shiould specifically look at, messages, kernelm, debug...
[08:19] <iulianpojar> psypher246: tail /var/log/messages , and wait untill it hapens
[08:19] <huwenfeng> how to delete the Evolution from my Ubuntu 8.04 LTS?

[08:21] <stefodnb> Hi
[08:21] <MenZa> Hello, stefodnb
[08:21] <stefodnb> How do I downgrade subversion from 1.5.1 to 1.3.2?
[08:21] <stefodnb> (compatibility problems)
[08:22] <cast> stefodnb: hmm, i'd suggest installing 1.3.2 in /usr/local,
[08:23] <stefodnb> and have 2 coexisting versions? sounds messy, no?
[08:23] <ill> Anyone know if Ubuntu 8.10 has any compatibility issues with Radeon 4850x2?
[08:23] <cast> not as messy as having 1.3 installed but all the rest of the packages for your release expecting 1.4 or 1.5
[08:23] <tomcyl> anyone know why my NVIDIA ACCELERATED driver can not activate? do i need to change the card?
[08:24] <cast> stefodnb: hmm, in what way are you using svn?
[08:24] <stefodnb> cast: ok, I was thinking my system had a requirement for something like svn >= 1.1, svn <= 1.5.1
[08:24] <c7m> it didn't work for me O_o
[08:25] <stefodnb> cast: Well we are developing software, I have a working copy which I edit and commit
[08:25] <stefodnb> cast: so other people on my team can get the changes. Normal stuff..
[08:25] <c7m> download driver from nvidia and install via console
[08:25] <c7m> nothing with your card i guess
[08:25] <cast> stefodnb: hmm, OT: ever used a distributed rcs? :)
[08:26] <stefodnb> cast: Nope. Coworkers are still struggling to switch from emailing diffs around, I'm keeping it as simple as possible. dvcs requires that one knows what hes doing.
[08:27] <cast> stefodnb: what compatibility issue are you running into? might be another way around it, if you let 1.5 touch your repo it may automagically upgrade it so 1.3 can't read it
=== zone is now known as Guest2856
[08:29] <stefodnb> cast: yeah, that seems to be what happened. Coworker using 1.3 fails to "svn up" a repo i touched with 1.5
[08:29] <stefodnb> it seems he's going to upgrade and i won't be downgrading, anyway.
[08:29] <cast> that's probably the better way to go about it :)
[08:30] <stefodnb> yeah if it's possible. i wasn't sure if his ubuntu 6.06 can support a recent svn version.
[08:30] <cast> i don't keep track of their changes between releases anymore, but i presume they would have fixed at least a few bugs between 1.3 and 1.5
[08:30] <cast> stefodnb: i'd very much expect one to be able to install subversion on it
[08:31] <stefodnb> i said a _recent_ svn, i.e. 1.5.1
[08:31] <cast> ahh, sorry, i meant recent svn :)
[08:32] <stefodnb> ah, cool.
[08:32] <prasot> k
[08:32] <cast> i don't have svn installed as i'm short on space, but i do pull from svn:// with hg often :) hmm, wonder how much ci support there is for hg/git to svn
[08:34] <stefodnb> do you mean using a bridge like git-svn, or natively from git?
[08:35] <Kimi> HI
[08:35] <Kimi> If i use guided use entire disk option for a 40gb hard disk... will it erase all the 40 gb and install .............. or it will completely delte the C drive alone ?????
[08:36] <Kimi> iMatter are you there ?
[08:37] <cast> stefodnb: either or
[08:38] <user_> Kimi: it will delete everything on the harddisk, C-Drive (of Windows) and any other drives (D,E..) as well
[08:38] <Kimi> ok user_
[08:38] <stefodnb> cast: looks like the svn1.5 .deb requires a newer libc than available in ubuntu6.06
[08:40] <Ranakah> 5.1 sound don't work in ubuntu intrepid?
[08:40] <cast> stefodnb: very likely, you can either [as you may have] look for a backport, see if you can build the .deb src package on 6.06, or make your own .deb for 6.06, or do the ol ./configure make make install
=== ubuntu__ is now known as vito590

[08:43] <Titan8990> mm2000, adduser is interactive whereas useradd can be more automated, but careful because I misconfigured user account can be pretty worthless

[08:50] <voice5sur5> ?
[08:50] <n2diy> voice5sur5: what command are you using?
[08:51] <voice5sur5> normal shutdown from application but its does the same thing with halt or shutdown
[08:51] <DasEi> Ranakah: what does that mean, only front, the physical front of the box or  just 2channel instead of f.e. surround ?
[08:51] <Lint01> DasEi: there's no data structures described there
[08:51] <voice5sur5> the only way is forced shutdown that risk data corruption

[08:52] <DasEi> Lint01: what to wanto to know ? better a #linux question
[08:52] <DasEi> do*
[08:52] <voice5sur5> or normal shutdown from gui

[08:54] <voice5sur5> -h stand for what?
[08:54] <n2diy> voice5sur5:  you'll need to sudo that
[08:54] <stefodnb> halt
[08:54] <cedric30> Salut
[08:54] <voice5sur5> the halt command doesn't work too
[08:54] <voice5sur5> the only one is poweroff -f

[09:36] <thelinuxN00b> Hi all having a ongoing problem, have gained root access but still wont let me  copy to a external hdd ntfs format. all the permissions seem to be right but it still wont go any ideas
[09:36] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:well, but i keep getting that terminal screen everytime i try to exit x server
[09:37] <AnRkey> ivanatwork, if your scanner supports scan to folder and windows shares then set up a smb share and scan to that
[09:37] <DasE1> thelinuxN00b: single file ?
[09:37] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: what terminal screen?
=== admin__ is now known as lamerion
[09:37] <AnRkey> ivanatwork, canon scanners do that for example works well for my clients
[09:37] <thelinuxN00b> whole folder about 30 gig
=== lamerion is now known as lamerion2
[09:37] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[09:37] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:a blank screen asking for my login, after i key taht in, then a password....after which its just a terminal window full screen
[09:37] <thelinuxN00b> DasE1: tried  a single file still didnt work
[09:38] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:i am trying to install NVIDIA graphics, which requires x server shutdown
[09:38] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: well that is linux running without x-server, isn't that what you wanted?
[09:38] <ivanatwork> AnRkey: i have an Epson Photo, not a network scanner. Too bad I found only gscan2pdf with german (!!) OCR...
[09:38] <DasE1> thelinuxN00b: sudo cp -r  /path/of/folder    /path/to/folder          ,   checkout sudo fdisk -l before to get correct devicenames
[09:38] <mid_> dmesg nothing, and /var/log/system file doesnt exist
[09:38] <AnRkey> hummahumma, try envyng
[09:38] <AnRkey> hummahumma, it does it all from the gui for u in one go
[09:38] <WeazelON> hey guys, i have a few users on the same computer, thing is i want to use screen on a different user and it tells me Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/3' - please check.
[09:38] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: depends on whether you do that from within the restricted drivers dialog or if you manually install them
[09:38] <AnRkey> hummahumma, it also downloads the drivers for u
[09:38] <DasE1> thelinuxN00b: external drive is mounted ?
[09:39] <bman> mount that
[09:39] <thelinuxN00b> DasE1: Thanx will give that a go!!!
[09:39] <bman> oh yeah
[09:39] <WeazelON> can anyone shed some light on that matter ?
[09:39] <AnRkey> hummahumma, sudo apt-get install envyng i think
[09:39] <thelinuxN00b> DasE1: not sure it has been detected, fairly new to this
[09:39] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:ok, so that terminal screen is linux without x server...?
[09:39] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: if you manually install them sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop is the command that you are looking for, execute this from a console which you can access with ctrl+alt+F1 to F6
[09:40] <DasE1> thelinuxN00b: type:                  mount                                                     ,to see all mounted devices
[09:40] <ivanatwork> i'm searching something like gscan2pdf
[09:40] <bman> hummahumma, that is linux
[09:40] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: exactly
[09:40] <bman> x isnt required
[09:40] <AnRkey> hummahumma, envy is far easier to use for nvidia and ati drivers
[09:40] <WeazelON> hey guys, i have a few users on the same computer, thing is i want to use     `screen`     on a different user and it tells me " Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/3' - please check. "
[09:40] <hummahumma> AnRkey:can u tell me what exactly is envy?how do i use it?
[09:40] <AnRkey> bman, isn't that dash instead of linux :)
[09:40] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: envy imho is bogus like hell, dont recommend that..
[09:40] <AnRkey> hummahumma, it's a gui for installing nvidia and ati drivers
[09:41] <jude> my computer is  old   drivers is sis
[09:41] <thelinuxN00b> DasE1: it appears to be mounted, states at bottom /dev/sdb1 on /media/New Volume type fuseblk (ro,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096)
[09:41] <jude> i can not install the drivers
[09:42] <hummahumma> AnRkey:i was anyway able to install nvidia yesterday, somehow...but i still cant use beryl, nor can i get 1280*760 resolution, only 800*600
[09:42] <bman> ive used linux since 94 and didnt use X until 2002
[09:42] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: then you dont really have it running
[09:42] <jude> so  i want know how can i install this drivers
[09:42] <AnRkey> hummahumma, u can use compiz-fusion if the drivers are installed. It's all done for u

[09:43] <remoteCTRL1> jude: this is an ubuntu channel not a redhat channel

[09:44] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: you might also sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings which is a graphical interface with which you can customize the driver
[09:45] <mid_> no hints?
[09:45] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL:but how can i customise it, if it says it hasnt been installed properly?
[09:45] <remoteCTRL1> how can i accomplish to see all of the open applications in the taskbar, also those on other workspaces?

[09:46] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL:ok let me boot in ubuntu first
[09:46] <AnRkey> hummahumma, read buddy, i told you earlier, sudo apt-get install envyng-gtk
[09:46] <jude> but my english so bad
[09:46] <thelinuxN00b> DasE1: Thanx heaps will give that a go
[09:46] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: well problem might be that if you install the drivers manually you might have to add the drivers name to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:46] <ortsvorsteher> jude: which is your mother language?
[09:46] <DasE1> thelinuxN00b: spaces in directorynames are alittle prob sometimes,you could mount the external to a dir with a contingous name

[09:49] <ubottu> jude, please see my private message
[09:49] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: you get major updates only on next operrating system upgrade, if you want to have this earlier you need to enable backports
[09:49] <DasE1> nightclaw: update/-grade ; see :
[09:49] <DasE1>  !latest
[09:49] <ubottu> Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are: fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports.
[09:49] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: backport does not mean back to previous versions but back from future versions to this one;)
[09:50] <DasE1> nightclaw: just do  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

[10:07] <fooey> my 8.10 livecd freezes at "starting bluetooth" during bootup, google returns a few results that cite conflicting tv tuners but I have neither those nor bluetooth devices. any ideas?
[10:07] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: hummkay as i thought you got a little messup there, i suggest the folowing: the driver that you installed has a remove option, do remove the driver on the commandline then again enable it in the hardware drivers menu, if you are lucky it works after that
[10:07] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:how do i remove the driver?
[10:08] <simplexio> podman99a: my best quess for max lenght is what is max lenght of argument for adduser, which few thousand charachters.. but i have newer tried
[10:08] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:how do i remove the driver? what is the command?
[10:08] <DasE1>  !paste > thelinuxN00b
[10:08] <ubottu> thelinuxN00b, please see my private message
[10:09] <fooey> any ideas?
[10:09] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: as i said the script that installs the driver has a remove option, i havent memorized exacly which one it is but try --remove
[10:10] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:ok, suppose i installed the driver frm a file 123.run...should i now try sh 123.run --remove?
[10:10] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: exactly
[10:10] <nightclaw> http://nopaste.at/e8e604c5d2 anyone any idea left why it does not update?
[10:11] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: that command only updates the software sources, not the operating system, that would be sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[10:12] <nightclaw> same result as normal upgrade
[10:12] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:ok, now i have uninstalled the nvidia drivers
[10:12] <dawdle> I just installed the proprietary ATI drivers for my radeon card. Previously (on generic drivers) two LCD screens worked perfectly using the Screen Resolution tool. On installing the drivers, the best I can get is Dual-Head, where each monitor seems to run a seperate session of X. They are actually different GUIs. How can I get it back to two monitors supporting one extended desktop? Running 8.1

[11:11] <tehfalcon28> i wonder why there's a nyodimium magnet inside a HD
[11:11] <marcusdavidus> tehfalcon28:  sure  what is your prob?
[11:11] <fosco_> !ask | tehfalcon28
[11:11] <ubottu> tehfalcon28: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
[11:11] <tehfalcon28> i have always thought that you shuldn't put a magnet
[11:11] <tehfalcon28> close to your hdd
[11:12] <azlon> anybody here use SCIM? im trying to activate it but its not working for some reason
[11:12] <sachin_> i think no one have a answer to my question of multi seat in intrepid
[11:12] <binarymutant> tehfalcon28, what would spin the disc?
[11:12] <marcusdavidus> tehfalcon28:  YES u should not 4 sure
[11:12]  * Gnea decides that his time will be better spent elsewhere right now
[11:12] <tehfalcon28> well...an motor?
[11:12] <DJones> tehfalcon28: That question is probably better asked in #hardware
[11:12] <tehfalcon28> ok
[11:12] <tehfalcon28> thanks
[11:12] <brucelee> i installed my pci nic, and hoped ubuntu would detect it after booting up, but it didnt, so now what?
[11:12] <fosco_> your right Gnea :-(
[11:13] <marcusdavidus> brucelee:   pls post lspci -vvv
[11:13] <brucelee> cool
[11:13] <brucelee> thanks
[11:13] <brucelee> let me try that
[11:13] <sachin_> does any  body here have a idea of multi seat in intrepid
[11:14] <brucelee> codepad?
[11:14] <brucelee> <koi> anyway, enough nonsense
[11:14] <brucelee> err
[11:14] <bullgard4> AlsaMixer outputs in the upper left: "Card: Intel 82801DB-ICH4". Somewhere I read: Card - 'Name of the AC-Link Controller'. What is meant by 'AC-Link'?
[11:14] <brucelee> sorry
[11:14] <FloodBot2> brucelee: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[11:15] <brucelee> i have it pasted onn http://codepad.org/obxvgFSg
[11:16] <ziroday> brucelee: its PCI right?
[11:17] <brucelee> yeah
[11:17] <brucelee> its PCI
[11:17] <brucelee> and its Dlink
[11:17] <brucelee> looking through my paste, i see something that says D-Link
=== onats_ is now known as onats
[11:17] <ziroday> brucelee: are you certain its plugged in correctly? Cause its not appearing in lscpi
[11:17] <brucelee> line 57, could that be it?
[11:18] <brucelee> its plugged in correctly because when i boot into windows with the same system, the network card works
[11:18] <brucelee> pci wireless g
[11:18] <ziroday> brucelee: sorry, thought it was a wireless card, yes that is it
[11:18] <brucelee> it is a wireless card :p
[11:18] <ziroday> brucelee: err thats interesting
[11:19] <brucelee> theres a nic built into the motherboard, and i installed the pci one into there
[11:19] <ziroday> brucelee: I have a feeling that its not going to work, whats the model number of the dlink?
[11:19] <brucelee> its dlink airplus 510
[11:19] <brucelee> i have revision A
[11:19] <fliegenderfrosch> I have to replace a harddisk in a raid1 (total 2 hds). Can I use a different model with a slightly larger capacity?

[11:20] <achadwick> http://hardware4linux.info/component/30107/ - looks like an ndiswrapper thing.
[11:20] <marcusdavidus> fliegenderfrosch:  i belive so
[11:20] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: seems correct, yet still it doesnt update it?
[11:20] <marcusdavidus> fliegenderfrosch:  but u cannot use hdd + sdd it will nto work sience  sdd is diferent
[11:21] <jatt> I want to obtain the .config file that was used to build the kernel binary shipped by Ubuntu. Is it available in any package?
[11:21] <ziroday> brucelee: you will have to use ndiswrapper, see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=760603
[11:21] <fliegenderfrosch> marcusdavidus: both are scsi drives
[11:21] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: dont forget, if you update the sources.list manually you neet to sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[11:21] <nightclaw> remoteCTRL yes unfortunately
[11:21] <marcusdavidus> fliegenderfrosch:  if both are standart HDD and get same  spin and sata type it will work
[11:22] <nightclaw> remoteCTRL http://nopaste.at/d9953a77cb
[11:22] <brucelee> ziroday thanks
[11:22] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: na sonderkomisch:D
[11:22] <fliegenderfrosch> marcusdavidus: ok, thanks. both are ibm scsi drives, the new one is just slightly larger
[11:23] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: sudo apt-get upgrade pidgin?

[11:24] <nightclaw> remoteCTRL1 second please, apt is working right now
[11:24] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: is it? what is it doing?

[11:27] <brucelee> ziroday, its asking me for location of driver, do i download the windows drivers and put it somewhere, then point to that location?

[11:52] <nightclaw> remoteCTRL1 http://nopaste.at/1ed8f1ec43
[11:53] <Lint02> yinlong: I don't know

[11:56] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: does ths finish without any action or does it install/remove something?
[11:56] <clusty> hey. is there a way to see which process is hogging all the I/O bandwidth ? (something like a per process iostat) ?
[11:57] <kenneth_> ubottu, compiz?
[11:57] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about compiz?
[11:57] <nightclaw> it suggests autoremove for several packages
[11:57] <nightclaw> libpurple being in the list
[11:57] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: autoremove... well thats not the point...
[11:57] <remoteCTRL1> libpurple?
[11:57] <nightclaw> libpurple-bin to be precise
[11:57] <kenneth_> compiz not loading as default. How to make it load?
[11:57] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: ok in that case sudp apt-get autoremove
[11:58] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: libpurple is part of pidgin as far as i recall..

[11:59] <ohletmeinnowjesu> so heres a seemingly stupid question
[11:59] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: sudo gedit <file>
[11:59] <ohletmeinnowjesu> does the ext3 fs get fragmented?
[11:59] <ohletmeinnowjesu> if not, why?
[11:59] <remoteCTRL1> !fragmentation
[11:59] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fragmentation
