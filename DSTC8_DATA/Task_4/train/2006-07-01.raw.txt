[10:41] <algor> i read it but i have problem, i have ipw2200 wireless
[10:41] <vlt> Hello. When I connect to a server via SSH with "-R 1324:TARGET_IP:80" it only listens to 127.0.0.1:1234. How can I make the remote machine listen to 0.0.0.0:1234?
[10:42] <vlt> Or maybe I can manage it without ssh and just use iptables. So how can I redirect connections from "-i ppp0 -p tcp --dport 1234" to TARGET_IP:80 (and its answers back to the client)?
[10:42] <efox> is the first user (durin the installation) created the root ?
[10:42] <efox> or is "su" the way to get to the root
[10:43] <dli> efox, no, root passwd is disabled in ubuntu by default
[10:43] <Madpilot> efox, just use sudo in front of your commands
[10:43] <efox> i am logged in as the first user created, is that a smart thing to do ?
[10:43] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell efox about sudo
[10:43] <ic56> efox: no. the first ordinary user created (uid 1000) is the one allowed to sudo to root, by virtue of belonging to the right groups
[10:43] <Madpilot> efox, sure
[10:44] <efox> no no..i kno bout sudo and su...im jus readin off a site (not that credible) about some linux stuff and it said that the first user created has all rights like root and shouldnt be used cuz u can damage your system

[10:45] <efox> thanks for all the help !
[10:45] <ic56> efox: the site makes a valid point.  However, Ubuntu is meant to be used by that single user -- it's meant to be a reasonable simulation of a windoze environment without going all the way.  If you're really paranoid, you can follow the site's advice and make yourself another user that won't have sudo privilege

[00:05] <earHertz> am I just supposed to know the curent version is 2?
[00:05] <Madpilot> earHertz, use Synaptic's handy search button
[00:06] <earHertz> Adium: No, I understand the answer to this problem. I want a general undertstanding. My biggest problem with linux right now is dependencies and trying to use apt-get, and it's really becoming a deal killer
[00:06] <Madpilot> looks like you want "libgtk1.2" - the number is almost always part of the package name
[00:07] <Madpilot> earHertz, if you've got a GUI, use Synaptic - it's far easier than farting around with apt-get trying to guess package names
[00:07] <earHertz> Yeah, but if I try to apt-get libgtk-1.2, it tell sme no package. Is my apt-get misconfigured?
[00:07] <Adium> apt will install all dependencies for you :), the best way to learn apt is open a terminal and man apt

[00:21] <earHertz> I suppose part ofr my problem is this: when I used cygwin, I installed ALL packages
[00:21] <earHertz> is there a way I can just INSTALL every goddamn package in ubuntu?
[00:21] <Healot> yeah/// one by one?
[00:22] <Adium> dunno, never tryed lol
[00:22] <nekostar> earHertz, no a lot of em conflict

[00:22] <S1ixx> where do you override the bit to enable logging in as root ?

[00:22] <ubuntu> mnakoronniki ebanue/// za chto xoxolov sdelali??
[00:22] <nekostar> Healot, that only gives you a local repository i think
[00:22] <earHertz> nekostar: yeah, I figured.
[00:22] <nekostar> earHertz, but you can sure as hell try :P
[00:22] <Healot> nekostar: local, and then you can install whatever you want
[00:22] <nekostar> like he said one by one
[00:22] <earHertz> It's just damned frustrating that I seem to spend more time apt-getting than beiing productive
[00:22] <nekostar> and then you will have a system thats broken :P
[00:23] <Healot> possible but crazy idea :-
[00:23] <ubuntu> fucking itali///its xoxol
[00:23] <earHertz> Healot: I set up ubunto with 20GB
[00:23] <nekostar> then imagine all the things you might wanna do
[00:23] <narfmaster> Slixx, in the System > Admin > Login Window
[00:23] <nekostar> and install anything you can google about for just that
[00:23] <nekostar> :)
[00:23] <Healot> earHertz: so you can make a good local repos
[00:23] <Healot> and archive it on a tape or something...
[00:23] <nekostar> though a local mirror is not a bad idea tbh

[00:58] <Pitersburgs> 80% of PCM volume is most optimal volume, also in Windows

[00:59] <johlin> Pitersburgs: Yeah I know, but it's annoying when I have other applications open with sound (movie player for example)

[01:00] <boobek> hi
[01:00] <Pitersburgs> so you can mix sources
[01:00] <johlin> So what does the gnome volume control do?
[01:01] <Pitersburgs> johlin: regulates main volume and other volumes of sound card
[01:01] <Pitersburgs> RB volume regulator regulates *RB* volume, not main
[01:01] <Pitersburgs> so
[01:01] <Pitersburgs> you for example
[01:01] <Pitersburgs> when you get call from Skype
[01:01] <Pitersburgs> you can tune down RB
[01:01] <Pitersburgs> but system volume will stay the same
[01:01] <johlin> But when I press the volume buttons on my keyboard, that should be the main volume right?

[01:04] <johlin> Pitersburgs: but it doesn't, when it's at 0% I can still hear rhytmbox clearly (even though the sound quality sucks)
[01:05] <Pitersburgs> johlin: wait a sec...you use your laptop/desktop keyboard keys to tune main volume up/down.
[01:05] <Pitersburgs> first of all, check it is it really main volume
[01:05] <Frogzoo> johlin: as far as I can tell, it's a bug...
[01:05] <dragos> heh..great!..xmms is quite close as functionality to winamp
[01:05] <dragos> finaly something familiar:D
[01:05] <snoops> uhh but xmms is shocking! The dialogs.. ugh
[01:05] <Frogzoo> dragos: but amarok is much nicer
[01:06] <dragos> I have amarok, but I can't play .mp3 files
[01:06] <Pitersburgs> it is still a bloody media player, what there is so nicer/uglier
[01:06] <Pitersburgs> :)
[01:06] <Frogzoo> dragos: read the pms you got
[01:06] <johlin> Pitersburgs: How do I check? Those buttons are selected as volume up/down in gnome keyboard shortcut settings, is that all?
[01:06] <dragos> okey
[01:06] <snoops> !restricted > dragos
[01:06] <johlin> Frogzoo: so should I report it somewhere?
[01:06] <uep> google's summer of code is working on an xmms2... maybe that'll be the ticket
[01:06] <Frogzoo> johlin: I think the devs know already ;)
[01:06] <Pitersburgs> johlin: take a look upper corner right, where is that sound volume applet
[01:06] <snoops> dragos you'll need to get those restricted formats installed to use them in amarok

[01:07] <Laibsch> I would like to have a remote printer shared via cups discovery set as default printer.  Trying to configure it via the web interface redirects me from the remote IP (non-SSL) to the hostname (SSL).  The latter page is never loaded and times out eventually.
[01:07] <Laibsch> How can I set the remote printer as default.  What is wrong in the configs?
[01:07] <Pitersburgs> uep: xmms2 almost is the same as bmp, which is already aviable
[01:07] <Frogzoo> Pitersburgs: there's the user interface, sound quality ...
[01:07] <johlin> Pitersburgs: yes, main volume was selected, and my soundcard (SB Live, ALSA) was selected.
[01:07] <gore_> ok check this weird problem, when I have no audio programs open, and I crank my sound to the max, my its making a bass sound

[01:35] <Kristan_uk2> no i requested it off ubuntu site and it arrived this morning
[01:35] <atlantian> so external drives and usb drives do not run on linux unless allowed by root?
[01:35] <sloncho> Kristan_uk2: ok, boot again from the cd, but when it displays the menu after the boot ("Start and install, etc, etc), select to change options, delete everything from the line and type only "linux server" no quotes
[01:35] <atlantian> that is nice

[01:35] <sloncho> Kristan_uk2: this will start text install
[01:35] <jrib> Kristan_uk2: have you tried others in the pack? sometimes there are burn problems.  Other than that, I would try the alternate install cd
[01:36] <Kristan_uk2> there is only the one cd in the pack
[01:36] <Kristan_uk2> is there a way i can install this alongside windows
[01:36] <sloncho> Kristan_uk2: when it is done and you boot in ubuntu, login and type: sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop

[01:37] <atlantian> jrib this sounds very basic, but once  your in disks how do i open them?
[01:37] <Kristan_uk2> so i will be able to switch which OS i want to use

[01:37] <sloncho> Kristan_uk2: yes - on boot
[01:37] <jrib> atlantian: well that lets you mount them.  Then anyone with proper permissions can view them.  What filesystem do the disks use?
[01:38] <sloncho> Kristan_uk2: before you go further - read the docs for dual boot
[01:38] <jrib> atlantian: they should get mounted in /media/*

[01:40] <jrib> atlantian: ok, with fat, it doesn't allow you to set unix style permissions.  So, you have to modify the permissions linux gives it when it gets mounted.  The easiest way to do this is to just setup a line in fstab with the proper permissions

[01:44] <jrib> atlantian: you have to run 'gconf-editor' and setup keybinding_commands and global_keybinds in the '/apps/metacity' keys.  To combine the window key with other stuff you have to set it up like '<mod4>d' or whatever the 'xmodmap' returns for the windows key instead of 'mod4'.  That's probably not all that clear, just ask :)

[02:09] <ompaul> orga mind if I message you about something o/t ?
[02:09] <finalbeta> morrolan, currently all programs can use the JDK, I don't really want to install a JRE.

[02:10] <ompaul> damy[ubuntu] , if it does not work out of the box do this /msg ubotu ndiswrapper and before ogra@ubuntu.com
[02:10] <morrolan> finalbeta: they can still use the JDK - the JDK will be default, except if you run a Java program through Firefox plugin, in which case it willl use the JRE
[02:10] <ompaul> woops
[02:10] <zcat[1] > no. Did you try just plugging it in and see what happens. I've found about 955 of stuff just works right away....
[02:10] <finalbeta> morrolan, what a waste.
[02:10] <morrolan> finalbeta: look at the URL I gave you, it explains it a little better
[02:10] <morrolan> finalbeta: I know, but it's the only way I know.

[02:11] <finalbeta> kal0, thnx for the info morrolan
[02:12] <gyro54> which is the best video card for DD with TV out?

[02:12] <snoops> can I backup my keyring?
=== morrolan is now known as morrolan|afk
[02:12] <JeevesBond> So does anyone have any idea why I can only access a samba share (Ubuntu -> Windows using the Administrator username and password to mount) with root privileges (i.e. having to sudo)?
=== morrolan|afk is now known as morrolan
[02:12] <morrolan> snoops: which keyring?

[02:13] <finalbeta> JeevesBond, only root can mount right?
[02:13] <snoops> morrolan umm well when I connect to say a remote windows share with the smb:// format it asks for the password, and asked if I want to save to keyring
[02:13] <JeevesBond> Correct, and that I can understand. Is there not a way when mounting that I can make the share available to other users?

[02:14] <finalbeta> The only way I know of is using fstab JeevesBond, but indeed, I hope there is a beter way
[02:14] <J0s3ph> Isn't it every 6 months roughly?
[02:14] <zcat[1] > !edgy
[02:14] <ubotu> edgy is the current development version of Ubuntu. Version 6.10, codename "Edgy Eft"

[02:15] <JeevesBond> Ahhhh, I see. That would mount it at startup wouldn't it? Sounds like a hard job to me!
[02:16] <zcat[1] > dapper was long-term support, edgy is supposted to play with bleeding-edge stuff I believe..
[02:16] <finalbeta> JeevesBond, same here, keep asking here, perhaps someone else knows more

[02:18] <zcat[1] > latest updates broke my xgl.. very annoying.
[02:18] <JeevesBond> there's some good stuff on the forums morphix
[02:18] <JeevesBond> I have set it up but under Gnome, with only one monitor
[02:18] <zcat[1] > 'damn you Quinn!!' :-)
[02:18] <finalbeta> I wouldn't recomment running XGL unless it's for playing.
[02:19] <morphix> JeevesBond, could u point me in the right direction??
[02:19] <morphix> finalbeta, why?

[02:19] <finalbeta> It's really buggy
[02:19] <finalbeta> and I mean, badly
[02:19] <JeevesBond> morphix: Certainly. What type of graphics card do you have? nvidia or ATI
[02:19] <zcat[1] > nah, it's been really good up til now..
[02:19] <finalbeta> It's handy, but it needs allot of work
[02:19] <JeevesBond> I haven't had any problem finalbeta
[02:19] <uep> i'd actually like to contribute development-wise to xgl

[02:20] <finalbeta> JeevesBond, opening a new windows in firefox opens on enother window, maximising windows sometimes takes two senconds. windows flip out, F10 works , but doesn't always go to the window you select
