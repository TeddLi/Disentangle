[00:32] <kent> pedlar, there is no package with the name gstreamer0.8-lame.  I cant find it either.
[00:32] <delire> pedlar: if there is a pacakge available you can simply install it.
[00:32] <kent> pedlar, and im using i386
[00:32] <delire> kent pedlar ouch. ok. perhaps you can try to compile it..
[00:32] <limer> how can I watch my dvd at /dev/hdc (aka) /media/cdrom0  ?
[00:32] <pedlar> delire, where would i get the source from?
[00:33] <delire> kent in debian testing there is a gstreamer0.8-lame
[00:33] <nalioth_wrkn> kent: do you have universe and multiverse in your sources.list?

[00:33] <kent> pedlar, what made you think that there should exist such a package by the way? maybe its called something else?

[00:37] <augmentor> my sources.list got messed up, can someone please send me a working copy with multiverse? thanks :)
[00:37] <kent> pedlar, if you read more carefully it says on that page that it is in Hoary-extras.  I dont know where that repositorie is :(
[00:37] <adam> HUM!
[00:37] <pusling> shinu: force-unload the module used by the process or reboot the computer
[00:37] <delire> shinu tried killall? there may be several dependent processes
[00:37] <crimsun> toxicfume: you need to install it
[00:38] <shinu> delire: tried it but doesnt seem to work
[00:38] <kent> pedlar, section 2.2 on that page will tell you how to configure so that you get the hoary-extra repositorie. After that, you can install gstreamer0.8-lame  :)

[00:41] <psychonate> Is *anyone* having problems with xorg along the lines of xorg running very slow after running fine for a while?
[00:42] <pusling> shinu: try forceunmount joliet, iso-6699 or whatever it is called
[00:42] <kent> pedlar, it doesn't show at all, or it shows the wrong version?

[00:42] <delire> spanglesontoast what errors?
[00:42] <pedlar> kent, no show
[00:42] <psychonate> as in, a few days of good performance, and then very slow performance until a restart of the server
[00:42] <IIIEars> pusling - did you need libdvdcss?
[00:42] <pusling> limer: ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat i think

[00:42] <spanglesontoast> file: /usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h
[00:42] <kent> pedlar, have you ran "sudo apt-get update" (or updated the list in synaptic) ?
[00:42] <delire> spanglesontoast you need the kernel source

[00:48] <spanglesontoast> weird world eh benplaut
[00:48] <psychonate> crimsun, I think it might be a memory leak issue with X.
[00:49] <psychonate> At least one person in #linuxhelp tried to help me.
[00:49] <spanglesontoast> theres two source packages
[00:49] <delire> ompaul hmm, yes i think that is closer to experience
[00:49] <apollo2011> I have (K)ubuntu system with both KDE and Gnome installed. I use KDE by default.  However, I just noticed that the Switch User option is suddenly missing from my K Menu.
[00:49] <pusling> shinu: perhaps you should also unload modules depending on <module_you_try_to_remove>
[00:49] <shinu> uh...
[00:49] <shinu> alright...
[00:49] <shinu> ill try that
[00:49] <psychonate> crimsun, I pasted a link to a bugzilla entry that may be similar

[00:51] <ompaul> delire, now there is a truism

=== ompaul goes in search of the strange bits and bytes
[00:52] <delire> ompaul ouch. let's hope you're not running a journaled fs ;)
[00:52] <ompaul> delire, like I would not do that ...
[00:53] <psychonate> crimsun, I don't doubt the possibility., and your guess is probably better than mine, but if I close all the apps running in X, it looks like the problem still stands until I restart the X server. I don't know if that helps you at all.
[00:53] <delire> ompaul hehe. recovery with reiserfs and ext2 is reasonably easy compared to that of ext3

[00:54] <delire> psychonate have you tried seeing what happens if you start X and then leave it with no applications running at all?

[01:03] <kent> delire, pedlar the package is to be taken from hoary-extras according to the wiki, and that's a repo out of Ubuntus control. So its probably something wrong with the amd64 compilation.. since it seems to be working for most others..
[01:03] <delire> pedlar amd64 is not as well supported as some other platforms just yet.
[01:03] <delire> kent: right
[01:03] <pedlar> does that mean that i can't rip mp3's
[01:03] <psychonate> crimsun, I really don't want to just run x alone for a few days, so I will probably just eliminate one application at a time.

[01:10] <delire> dpod: i for instance have "auto eth0 iface eth0 inet dhcp" in /etc/network/interfaces. this requests an IP from a DHCP server (my router) each boot.

[01:12] <Chislon> delire, ok thank you, when deciding on a linux distro... what all goes into a decision... like they basically just package different applications to start with, adn have the differnet package management, and different communities, is that it? but you can wiht any distro get any application that any other distro has, is this correct? and how many kinds of package management are there, and where is a good place that might let me rea
[01:12] <Chislon> d the differences in a way i might understand atleast some?

[01:13] <toxicfume> crimsun: oh!
[01:13] <toxicfume> one second
[01:13] <delire> Chislon: you've pretty much nailed it.
[01:13] <mattlacey> johnnyfav: you can use a knoppix cd too... run grub and then 2 lines: root(hd0,0)... setup(hd0) (i think)... with the correct partitions etc...
[01:13] <disasm> kurt__: whats in your xorg.conf?
[01:13] <Chislon> delire, ok thank you, do you know a good place to read those differences for the package management?
[01:13] <nalioth> Chislon: distrowatch.org? maybe
[01:13] <kurt__> disasm: it's pretty much default
[01:13] <disasm> kurt__: and why are you using alien?
[01:13] <Chislon> nalioth, ok thank you
[01:14] <delire> Chislon: there are only a small number (comparitively speaking) of applications which are not available across all distributions.
[01:14] <kurt__> because the fglrx driver doesn't work for 2.6.11 afaik?
[01:14] <dpod> delire: the problem I'm having is that I need to run wpa_supplicant and then reset my wlan0 after boot up; the result is that the network interface formatting on boot is just wasting time (especially the clock setting since that needs to happen after wpa_supplicant and resetting the wlan0 is done). I figured if I could move them out the startup and build a quick sh script, I'd be ahead of the game. Ideas or suggestions?
[01:14] <toxicfume> crimsun: ah yes i see it now
[01:14] <mattlacey> johnnyfav: it'll use your /etc/grub.conf from wherever you set the root
[01:14] <Chislon> i heard that ubuntu is new, but its like relativly new in temrs of the other distros i take it? because i also thought i heard its been around more than a year
[01:14] <nalioth> kurt is ready for an adventure
[01:14] <kurt__> indeed.
[01:14] <Chislon> delire, and then is there an equivalent application available for the distro that the specific app might not work for?
[01:14] <toxicfume> crimsun: the documentation is saying to install the prerequisite packages: build essential kernel-headers-$version, where can i get that file from?
[01:15] <disasm> kurt__: ah, i'm using a 2.6.10 so that might be true
[01:15] <delire> Chislon: the differences really are between package managers, not pacakge types per se. emerge == gentoo, apt == debian (and derivatives like ubuntu), rpm == redhat (and derivatives like Mandrake)
[01:15] <crimsun> toxicfume: you already have those
[01:15] <nalioth> Chislon: ubuntu is very user friendly & very user supported
[01:15] <crimsun> toxicfume: (Ubuntu uses linux-headers, not kernel-headers)
[01:15] <toxicfume> crimsun: ah okay
[01:15] <disasm> kurt__: if it's going to mesa, it's probly because your xorg.conf is saying ati for driver and not fglrx

[01:28] <kbrooks> GammaRay: dpkg is used by apt
[01:28] <matteorox> LinuxJones, nope..what is it ?
[01:28] <spanglesontoast> I used the ubuntu one
[01:28] <GammaRay> kbrooks: so?
[01:28] <Amaranth> nalioth: those should be fine, as long as your just getting the source and not building them blindly
[01:28] <knoppix> Will Ubuntu work well on a 5 GB partition?
[01:28] <matteorox> LinuxJones, where can i find information about ?
[01:28] <nalioth> knoppix: less than 3.5
[01:28] <GammaRay> kbrooks: I never said it was not
[01:28] <skora> tiefox, giving us some more detailed information would help us ;]
[01:28] <adam> Who can help me in the WINEX?
[01:28] <kbrooks> GammaRay: dpkg is LOW LEVEL
[01:28] <nalioth> Amaranth: i've got lots of deb-src (redheaded stepchild PPC user that i am)
[01:28] <GammaRay> kbrooks: are you trying to make my point?

[01:28] <Chislon> i think i understand the basic concept, but im not an expert, open source, anyone can look at it, free as in freedom of speech not as in price tag, ability to see and modify and use source as you like
[01:28] <Amaranth> adam: /join #cedega
[01:28] <crimsun> toxicfume: hmm, it should be looking for linux-headers, not kernel-headers
[01:29] <kbrooks> GammaRay: yes.
[01:29] <LinuxJones> matteorox, basically it's a whole bunch of packages. Most of the software in Debian is in those repos
[01:29] <GammaRay> kbrooks: comparing apt to rpm is wrong. comparing it to urpmi makes more sense
[01:29] <delire> spanglesontoast: you need to purge that old xorg package and reinstall the ati fglrx deb you made.
[01:29] <knoppix> Is a 5 gb partition too small for a 3.5 GB installation?  Is there a way to make it smaller while still keeping Gnome?
[01:29] <adam> ok thx
[01:29] <Amaranth> LinuxJones: most=all, afaik
[01:29] <delire> spanglesontoast: sadly i have to go, it's very very late here.
[01:29] <GammaRay> kbrooks: afterall there *is* an apt for rpm
[01:29] <kbrooks> LinuxJones: the packages are compiled from src
[01:29] <matteorox> LinuxJones, ok...what have i to add to sources.list to take it all ?
[01:29] <spanglesontoast> ok

[01:29] <Amaranth> GammaRay: what are you arguing about?
[01:29] <LinuxJones> matteorox, >> http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/UniversePackages
[01:30] <tiefox> i just upgraded it to an ABIT motherboar with via ac97  ( via82xx ) onboard sound
[01:30] <kbrooks> Amaranth: he isnt arguing.
[01:30] <spanglesontoast> realtek ac97 my sub works hehe!
[01:30] <toxicfume> crimsun: but still, i don't have any file or folder with the name linux-headers in /usr/src/
[01:30] <Amaranth> kbrooks: what are you talking about then?
[01:30] <matteorox> LinuxJones, ok thanks..now i'll read
[01:30] <LinuxJones> kbrooks, I was trying to make it as easy to understand as possible :)
[01:30] <tiefox> now my sound comes with a lot of noise and bad quality... ( im sure that this new motherboard is OK...was just running it on slackware  )
[01:30] <Amaranth> tiefox: my via ac97 works perfectly
[01:30] <crimsun> toxicfume: did you install linux-headers-$(uname -r) like I said?
[01:30] <kbrooks> Amaranth: pleasse dont  butt in. we're talking about ..... well, dpkg == rpm etc
[01:30] <toxicfume> crimsun: i thought i did, let me try again
[01:31] <Amaranth> kbrooks: Trying to decide if I should make you stop or not.
[01:31] <toxicfume> crimsun: whats the command again? or could i get it from synaptics?
[01:31] <toxicfume> -s
[01:31] <crimsun> toxicfume: sudo aptitude install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[01:31] <toxicfume> okay
[01:31] <tiefox> I was wondering if it could be a problem from changing motherboards without reinstalling ubuntu...
[01:31] <kbrooks> Amaranth: Please don't firewall me and him.
[01:31] <Chislon> kbrooks did you see my response?

[01:33] <Amaranth> breezy will have a new GNOME audio cd burner that rocks
[01:33] <japoeder> do I get that via synaptic
[01:33] <mattlacey> japoeder: you'll need the k3b-mp3 package as well
[01:33] <tiefox> the problem is bad sound quality with a lot of static
[01:33] <Chislon> kbrooks, well dinner is ready so im gonna go eat and then ill be back, so if your here and you want to talk to me and if that works for you then thats great, either way, thank you ofr your help

[01:50] <crimsun> tiefox: your Master and PCM levels are up really high - too high, in fact
[01:50] <crimsun> toxicfume: correct. Remember dependencies work top-down
[01:50] <kbrooks> Chislon: apt relies on the "low level" program, dpkg.
[01:50] <toxicfume> crimsun: okay, and then after that, how do i load the new drives? modprobe ipw2200?

[01:53] <nalioth> bolivar: those pkgs are not suppprted by ubuntu developers
[01:54] <strider> does anyone knows how to fix CUPS?
[01:54] <kbrooks> Chislon: rpm (the program) takes a PATH to a rpm.
[01:54] <nalioth> bolivar: but you can use them, and get help on irc
[01:54] <crimsun> toxicfume: once you unload all the modules related to ipw2200 and its dependencies
[01:54] <Chislon> kbrooks, i dont know the difference between that and waht you jsut said to me
[01:54] <kbrooks> Chislon: then it installs it.
[01:54] <toxicfume> crimsun: okay, i guess i've done that :)
[01:55] <bolivar> the support isnt an issue.  just not desiring anything 'hiding' in the package
[01:55] <crimsun> bolivar: yes, you can trust them in that sense.
[01:55] <bolivar> ok very good
[01:55] <kbrooks> Chislon: apt and rpm are different  in that apt searches and uses a program internally
[01:55] <bolivar> thanks a bunch
[01:55] <nalioth> Chislon: if you go to www.tldp.org you will find a wealth of info on how linux works (rpm, apt, etc)

[01:56] <_Church_of_Foamy> anyone know how to make a complete backup of your system?
[01:56] <Chislon> kbrooks, but they have to find the program on line first and download it right?
[01:56] <kbrooks> Chislon: it then installs the rrpm.
[01:56] <kbrooks> Chislon: yes
[01:56] <toxicfume> crimsun: i'm getting an error with modprobe ipw2200
[01:56] <crimsun> good, I expected you would.

[02:26] <Dvondrake> lol ok
[02:26] <illicit> Can anyone tell me real quit what other IMing clients are availible besides Gaim?
[02:26] <Dvondrake> and the ubuntu installer can make and size the partitions for me, right?
[02:26] <illicit> quick*
[02:26] <dnys> illicit: nAIM
[02:26] <illicit> Thanks
[02:27] <dnys> illicit: its a term aim client
[02:27] <illicit> Dvondrake: No, you need something else like, partition magic to shrink the already partitioned partition
