[10:41] <skratchez> really want to give props to whoever designed the UI on linux live
[10:41] <skratchez> the GTA font and alpha channel is a nice touch
[10:48] <skratchez> linuxlive can't even see the .iso wtf?
[10:49] <EriC^^> skratchez: you can't browse for it?
[10:49] <skratchez> it can't
[10:49] <EriC^^> it migt not recognize it as the release but it'll still write it
[10:49] <skratchez> it's looking for *.iso and seeing nothing
[10:50] <EriC^^> try pressing on "all types"
[10:50] <skratchez> and *.whatever a linux distro might be but nothing
[10:50] <skratchez> the dropmenu says ISO / IMG /ZIP (*.iso;*.img;*.zip...... and when i click it i get no more options than that
[10:51] <skratchez> maybe it needs to be run as admin, idk
[10:51] <EriC^^> are you sure it's there? can you see it in the filemanager?
[10:51] <skratchez> yeah
[10:52] <YankDownUnder> skratchez, Does it actually have the extension of ".ISO"? Just asking...
[10:52] <EriC^^> maybe it's case sensitive?
[10:52] <skratchez> that is actually a good question because it shows as a virtual clone drive file, but yeah also has a .iso extension
[10:53] <skratchez> and i have windows set to show extensions
[10:54] <YankDownUnder> Strange that...never experienced that bit before...UNLESS the .ISO is flagged as "system file/read only" - ya never know...
[10:55] <skratchez> yeah, i've had issues with windows permissions and this disk is definitely doing something spooky (can not reset windows, can not create a repair disk, can not create a system restore point... but will continue to run)
[10:57] <YankDownUnder> skratchez, Er...have you done a low level file system check on the Windows drive? (in a cmd prompt, do: chkdsk c: /f ==> when the system reboots, it will force a check on the integrity of the disk...)
[10:57] <skratchez> yeah that's one of the many things that fail on this thing
[10:58] <YankDownUnder> skratchez, Ooooo...not good...not good...is there a means by which to remove the drive and check it on another workstation - OR - do you have a WindowsPE boot - like a CD or a USB?
[10:58] <skratchez> memtest.exe, you name it, this beast has failed it but it's been running since the bush administration
[10:59] <skratchez> and i have replaced the memory :P
[10:59] <YankDownUnder> Bush had an administration? Wow...far out...musta flipped the channel and bypassed that one... ;)
[10:59] <skratchez> yeah i got this laptop and nothing for now, tomorrow is a new day though so
[11:00] <YankDownUnder> Yersh - tomorrow always brings fresh new insights
[11:01] <Sparrow__> Have you guys heard or used Hirens recovery disk
[11:01] <skratchez> it's a gateway nv59, special discount at wurst buy back in the day because they mislabeled early i5 processors as i3
[11:01] <bazhang> Sparrow__, not for ubuntu
[11:01] <skratchez> *ack*
[11:01] <Sparrow__> Handy to have in your toolbox
[11:01] <YankDownUnder> Hirens 9.9! Yay! The best of the best! Yay!
[11:01] <bazhang> skratchez, is linux live a windows tool for writing usb
[11:01] <oerheks> Sparrow__, yes, but Ultimate Boot cd is my favorite
[11:02] <Sparrow__> bazhang, Thought he had a windows box there
[11:02] <YankDownUnder> "GATEWAY COMPUTER THAT STILL RUNS?" OMG OMG OMG...
[11:02] <skratchez> yes
[11:02] <bazhang> skratchez, why ask about using a windows tool here
[11:02] <skratchez> i can almost make out cow spots on the the clicky parts
[11:03] <YankDownUnder> I used to have to service those monstrosities...egads...
[11:03] <skratchez> i'm not? i want a linux usb/disc to fix this thing
[11:03] <YankDownUnder> MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH...
[11:03] <bazhang> skratchez, you are asking about linux live or not
[11:03] <bazhang> YankDownUnder, stop the excessive chatter please
[11:04] <YankDownUnder> I just realised something, too, skratchez - you COULD get an "older version" of Ubuntu - like old...and burn that ISO and make a boot CD...
[11:04] <skratchez> i'm asking about using anything, i am not familiar with different boot options
[11:04] <skratchez> yeah, i have a bunch of blank cds, or i could go to the store tomorrow/today and get a rw dvd and just put a new windows .iso on
[11:05] <skratchez> there is just something so frustrating about this box
[11:05] <bazhang> skratchez, so this is completely about getting a windows iso to usb
[11:05] <skratchez> no
[11:06] <skratchez> i'm ready to bail on windows (at least temporarily just to use this as a web browser, plex server)
[11:06] <YankDownUnder> Getting a linux ISO to a USB (or CD/DVD) on a Gateway (shivers)

[11:10] <funabashi> Hi guys, i have a slow machine does this output from top command looks bad ? https://pastebin.com/tFuNTg0R
[11:11] <Ben64> funabashi: no
[11:11] <pushpak> so what should i do now?
[11:11] <oerheks> 15 days up ... yes, no recent kernel update
[11:11] <ikevin> funabashi, your machin use swap
[11:12] <skratchez> legacy
[11:12] <funabashi> ikevin: should it use swap ?
[11:13] <ikevin> funabashi, you just have 1Gb of ram?
[11:14] <skratchez> so @EriC^^ what does legacy imply?
[11:15] <EriC^^> skratchez: it means it's not a secureboot issue or bad uefi implementation
[11:15] <EriC^^> so that's good
[11:16] <skratchez> ah
[11:16] <EriC^^> skratchez: for legacy to boot, all the bios needs is a valid partition table on the device, plus some bios want to see a boot flag on one of the partitions
[11:17] <skratchez> i had hoped rufus did this automagically
[11:17] <EriC^^> and it'll boot whatever is in the bootloader location in the mbr, whether grub or windows etc it wont mind
[11:17] <EriC^^> yeah
[11:19] <skratchez> eh, i'm gonna sleep on it with this pos all half disassembled
[11:19] <skratchez> thanks for the advice, ttyl
[11:20] <EriC^^> ok, np
[11:21] <mikhael_k33hl> I can't set the efi partition as the /boot/efi mount point
[11:21] <Sparrow__> skratchez, what part of the world are you in
[11:22] <skratchez> pacific northwest
[11:22] <Sparrow__> I am in calif, do you not have better hardware around
[11:22] <EriC^^> skratchez: my money's on usb port screwing up sometimes
[11:23] <EriC^^> it's happened with me as well, perfectly fine usb, sometimes it wouldn't boot ubuntu i'd use the usb port next to it and it'd boot, other times it would just work
[11:23] <skratchez> i might give that a chance inasec but that same port will load win recovery, and yeah i've read a bunch of stories where that happens like you said. worth a shot
[11:25] <EriC^^> it's very likely in this case, unless rufus is forgetting to put the boot flag or something
[11:27] <EriC^^> the bios can't tell what you're booting anyways, it's just going to run whatever is in that mbr, if grub isn't put there right you should at least have gotten some error

[11:45] <maffh> I am trying to learn about processes in Ubuntu. When a process in the swap space, is it possible that the operating system run such a process? Or do you have to wait till there is enough space available on the ram?
[11:45] <Sparrow__> mikhael_k33hl, At the bottom of the partitioner you have boot selection installation?

[12:20] <mati_> Hi , I want to install a driver for my cpu (intel skylake), and properity drivers for my nvidia grx960, but when I'm doin' it from addidtional driver my whole desktop stuck. I wrote this yesterday but I was not able to run system that time.
[12:21] <mati_> I've just  finish install  os right now
[12:21] <hateball> mati_: is this on... 17.04 or what?
[12:22] <mati_> hateball: 17.04
[12:22] <hateball> mati_: that uses... nvidia 375?
[12:23] <mati_> hateball: Yeap I tried to install this one.
[12:23] <hateball> mati_: did you install both intel microcode and nvidia binary at the same time?
[12:23] <Guest62881> hi
[12:23] <mati_> hateball:  No I didn't,  I always install intel as a first driver than nvidia(with reboot)
[12:24] <hateball> mati_: right, so intel worked fine then I take it
[12:26] <hateball> mati_: while not offical, you could try install 378 from the not-official-but-official-PPA
[12:26] <hateball> mati_: to do so, run this in a terminal: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa && sudo apt update && sudo apt install nvidia-378
[12:26] <mati_> hateball:  Ok, I will try this.
[12:27] <hateball> mati_: there is also 381 which is beta driver
[12:27] <hateball> (I use that and it works fine for me)
[12:28] <mati_> hateball: I read that earlier. but is it normal that download speed is so low 20-100b/s?
[12:29] <mati_> hateball:  I will be in couple min, I need to reboot os
[12:31] <davidj> Alright, alright. I give in! My gtx 1080 now works with proprietary drivers, so I'm 100% ubuntu again. ;)
[12:31] <rud0lf> hooray \o/
[12:31] <rud0lf> long live ubuntu
[12:32] <mati_> davidj:   gz :D hateball: Again after install intel drivers, os stuck when write in terminal reboot
[12:32] <davidj> Sidenote: I swapped to gnome3 preemptively, it works relatively okay out of the box.
[12:32] <davidj> @mati_ yeah, I can't stomach latency.
[12:32] <davidj> "2fps desktop?! !@#$. Reverting to macos" :p
[12:32] <hateball> mati_: but you can power it off and it boots up properly again?
[12:33] <hateball> mati_: so it is just rebooting that fails?
[12:33] <davidj> @mati_ oh! It's a current issue? Hm. Can you get to a shell?
[12:34] <hateball> nouveau has plenty of quirks that could prevent a proper shutdown, which is why you'll want to get the nvidia blob asap
[12:34] <hateball> for 9xx series and up I should say. nouveau does work well for some cards
[12:35] <davidj> Nouveau is 'good enough' for me, and honestly even with the gtx 1080 was more than sufficient. There were some bugs on wayland, but otherwise all is well now. (Jumped to fedora temporarily when ubuntu was treating me like garbage)
[12:35] <mati__> hateball:  aha, I didn't know that, thx for this info
[12:36] <hateball> mati__: so, any luck getting 378 or 381 from ppa?
[12:37] <mati__> hateball:  not yet, I'm waiting to downlaod this driver from repo
[12:39] <mati_> hateball:  I hope it will be finally ok
[12:40] <multifractal> I have this 'displaylink' USB hub at work. It used to work fine with my setup, but since clean installing fresh 16.04, I haven't been able to get it working again. Instlled driver with .run file but when I connect it, the screen just goes black with a single line of text at the top about /dev/something and a long number...
[12:41] <multifractal> And becomes unresponsive, have to switch off with power button.

[12:44] <davidj> @mati_ There might be a more sane way of doing it, but I've never found one.
[12:44] <hateball> mati_: test what?
[12:44] <deemo> what kind of scripts are files *.d ?
[12:44] <davidj> @mati_ Just remember the hotkeys for another shell when you reboot. ctrl-shift 1 iirc.
[12:44] <mati_> hateball:  test nvidia driver is it works?
[12:44] <jewels> Hi. I am trying to install the NVIDIA driver for my GeForce 920M. At the moment, when I am not able to use dual monitors because NVIDIA settings doesn't recognize them. Here there is the result of the command for graphics troubleshooting (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicsTroubleshootingProcedure): http://paste.ubuntu.com/24542672/

[12:44] <jewels> Someone can help me please?
[12:45] <jewels> What's wrong with my configuration?
[12:45] <mati_> hateball: aaa, ok :D
[12:45] <hateball> mati_: well you can run "lspci -k" and look at the VGA section, see that it lists nvidia as the used module
[12:45] <jewels> I have installed the driver using the GUI.
[12:45] <mati_> hateball:  thanks a llot
[12:45] <hateball> mati_: and i suppose you can just try a reboot and see if it still hangs
[12:45] <deemo> hmm hotkeys for different run levels? I am trying to exit into a lower run level from Linux Windows.
[12:47] <deemo> basically I want exit linux windows into run level 1. Is there an easy way to do this?

[12:47] <davidj> @deemo Do you mean windows 'wsl', or ubuntu as a virtual machine?
[12:47] <hateball> deemo: init 1 ?
[12:48] <davidj> @mati_ The hotkeys to get to a shell are ctrl-alt-f1 (through f6). ctrl-alt-f7 to get back to your main one. (just for reference)
[12:48] <davidj> Might be preaching to the choir though, given you solved your graphics issue so easily :p
[12:48] <deemo> I mean to window manager which is run at level 5, or perhaps level 3.

[12:49] <davidj> @deemo You might want to try the hotkeys I just mentioned
[12:49] <jewels> Any ideas? Nobody can help me?
[12:49] <davidj> @deemo That is, ctrl-alt-f1 (through f6). f7 to get back to your wm.
[12:49] <davidj> @deemo https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/83336/relationship-among-runlevels-and-virtual-terminals-tty is a good read on the topic.
[12:50] <deemo> interesting
[12:51] <davidj> @deemo I should note, not an expert on the topic.

[13:33] <mikhael_k33hl> EriC^^: So if I install the bootloader in the efi partition of Windows, will I still be able to dual boot?
[13:33] <EriC^^> mikhael_k33hl: yeah
[13:33] <gogeta> mikhael_k33hl, yes grun handels that
[13:33] <gogeta> grub
[13:34] <mikhael_k33hl> EriC^^: do I need a separate /boot partition?
[13:34] <gogeta> mikhael_k33hl, you only need the efi boot partation
[13:34] <EriC^^> mikhael_k33hl: no, you don't
[13:35] <mikeymop> mikhael_k33hl: you dont mount the efi partition, just leave it and install like it doesn't exist
[13:36] <pc_> why does my screen brightness increase everytime i suspend the laptop and enter again?
[13:36] <mikhael_k33hl> the efi partition WIndows create is only 200m, is that okay?
[13:36] <gogeta> mikhael_k33hl, as long as you dont let to many kernrls build up
[13:37] <mikhael_k33hl> so below there is this Device for boot loader installation: where should I point it? to /dev/sda or /dev/sdb1(efi parition created by Windows)?
[13:37] <EriC^^> mikhael_k33hl: yeah that's more than enough
[13:37] <EriC^^> mikhael_k33hl: /dev/sdb
[13:38] <mikhael_k33hl> EriC^^: /dev/sdb? that's the windows partition
[13:38] <EriC^^> mikhael_k33hl: that's the windows disk
[13:39] <mikhael_k33hl> EriC^^: yeah, should I point it to /dev/sdb? or /dev/sdb1(the specific efi partition)?
[13:39] <EriC^^> no just /dev/sdb
[13:39] <gogeta> umm whats on sda
[13:40] <EriC^^> mikhael_k33hl: just make sure you're booted in uefi mode
[13:40] <pynki> probably the install usb gogeta
[13:40] <gogeta> thats odd
[13:40] <EriC^^> mikhael_k33hl: ls -l /sys/firmware/efi in a terminal should show you what mode you're booted in
[13:40] <mikhael_k33hl> EriC^^: yeah, that commands displays a lot of stuff
[13:40] <zzarr> hello!
[13:40] <EriC^^> ok, you're all good then
[13:41] <mikecmpbll> when i try to switch user and use `systemctl --user` to control a user service in systemd, i get "Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory"
[13:42] <mikecmpbll> if i ssh in as the deploy user, i can use systemctl --user, but if i `sudo su` to switch to root, and `su deploy` to switch back to deploy, i get the error
[13:42] <jh_> hello
[13:42] <zzarr> is it possible to build an image of a desktop Ubuntu for a Android tablet with the help of mkbootimg and the kernel source?
[13:43] <zzarr> I have an ASUS Zenpad Z300C (P023)
[13:43] <mikecmpbll> any ideas how i can achieve this so i can control the service from a script running as root?
[13:44] <zzarr> I have the kernel source (from ASUS page)
[13:49] <captainfixerpc14> G'morning - is this complicated?
[13:49] <captainfixerpc14> OpenJDK Client VM warning: You have loaded library /tmp/libnetty-transport-native-epoll2874168368219290008.so which might have disabled stack guard. The VM will try to fix the stack guard now.
[13:49] <captainfixerpc14> It's highly recommended that you fix the library with 'execstack -c <libfile>', or link it with '-z noexecstack'.
[13:50] <acresearch> hello people. what is the difference between ubuntu server and debian server? (neither has a desktop environment) and both sort of are the same under the hood (except for the update on some appilcation)... is my understanding correct?
[13:52] <pynki> acresearch, no. the same is not correct
[13:52] <acresearch> pynki: oh
[13:52] <acresearch> pynki: so what are the differences  (in general)
[13:53] <pynki> acresearch, the software you install come from different places/people
[13:54] <pynki> like pizza, kinda the same everywhere...
[13:54] <acresearch> pynki: yeh i get that, but in term of performance, i mean i have a server and i have ubuntu on it, but there are many different options including debian, i chose ubuntu becuase i know ubuntu, why would someone choose debian or another distro in a server environment
[13:55] <Sparrow__> speed
[13:55] <pynki> ideology
=== zzz is now known as Guest58375
[13:56] <pynki> the firefox name is trademarked... you wont find it in debian
[13:56] <pynki> just to give an example
[13:56] <ducasse> acresearch: personal preference, which ecosystem they know better
[13:56] <ducasse> just to give another
[13:56] <acresearch> ducasse: hmmm
[13:57] <pynki> ubuntu server brings a lot of stuff you wont need. a headless debian install is way "cleaner" in my eyes
[13:58] <acresearch> pynki: oh
[13:58] <BluesKaj> well, most users don't do headless
[13:58] <acresearch> but it still has this issue with su and sudo and you cannot install propriety software correct?
[13:58] <marcarrelus> Hi, VLC 2.2.4 should have by default a HEVC decoder, right? I'm trying to play a h265 video but VLC just results in a black screen. I used ppa:strukturag/libde265 in the past, but it seems that there is no support anymore for later releases (I'm on zesty).
[13:59] <captainfixerpc14> acresearch,  Debian has root account enabled by default, but can be configured to use sudo
[13:59] <pynki> acresearch, you can install whatever you want on a debian system. they will not bring packets for software that is non-free of any kind
[14:00] <acresearch> pynki: i see
[14:00] <acresearch> i think i undertsand now :-)
[14:00] <Sparrow__> !su
[14:00] <ubottu> sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !pkexec (for older releases: !gksu and !kdesudo). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[14:01] <Sparrow__> That was for my own benefit guys
[14:01] <ducasse> marcarrelus: vlc plays h265 just fine here on 17.04, i've not done anything other than installing it afaicr
[14:01] <marcarrelus> aha, Gnome videos can decode it. iirc this uses gstreamer under the hood, so I guess there the plugins are correctly installed.
[14:02] <marcarrelus> perhaps there is something special about the stream. It is related to a video course, so I wouldn't be surprised about it. Thanks :)
[14:03] <BluesKaj> marcarrelus,  make sure you have libde265-0 installed
[14:03] <Alby_Fox> If I wanted to change the default behavior of the alt+tab function in the default wm of ubuntu 16.04 is there a straightforward path to doing so?
[14:03] <pynki> is there a reason to keep the ~/Desktop folder in a fluxbox install?
[14:04] <Georgies> Hello. For some reason I cannot apt-get update now on my Ubuntu Server yakkety
[14:04] <marcarrelus> BluesKaj: already installed, but thanks. I can continue with gnome videos, so no problem anymore :)
[14:05] <Georgies> http://paste.ubuntu.com/24543037/ is my issue
[14:06] <Georgies> I believe it's 16.10
[14:06] <ducasse> pynki: i can't think of any, i nuked mine ages ago with no ill effects so far :)
[14:07]  * pynki nukes Desktop folders
[14:08] <ducasse> pynki: if you want to execute .desktop files and/or get the xdg autostart stuff, check out 'dex'
[14:09] <ducasse> (rofi is also good for running .desktop stuff)
[14:09] <LampLovin> just joined the channel, but how does rofi compare to alfred for macos?
[14:10] <ducasse> LampLovin: rofi is a pretty bare-bones launcher, but very extensible
[14:10] <LampLovin> so it's more on par with spotlight? i know, lots of mac references, but that's what i'm used to
[14:10] <pynki> ducasse, no need of fancy stuff. just a desktop to put a terminator window with a specific layout as "background" and i am fine...
[14:11] <mikhael_k33hl> I've installed Ubuntu on an encrypted partition (LUKS/LVM2), is there any other things I need to configure after the GUI installation? or is everything gets taken care of?
[14:12] <pynki> ducasse, and a, in my case shft+space, keycombo to get the menu ;)
[14:12] <ducasse> LampLovin: don't have a mac, so no clue really.
[14:13] <pynki> mikhael_k33hl, the standard encryption from the installer?
[14:13] <ducasse> pynki: rofi is my menu :)
[14:13] <mikhael_k33hl> pynki: Nope I did it via terminal cryptsetuyp
[14:13] <LampLovin> ducasse: no problem, thanks
[14:15] <Georgies> Can someone help my issue out/
[14:15] <ducasse> LampLovin: it's just a simple way to run commands, .desktop files, open ssh connections or select windows by default, but you can make it do a lot more with scripts
[14:15] <Georgies> http://paste.ubuntu.com/24543037/ is my issue
[14:15] <ducasse> Georgies: has this been happening for long?
[14:15] <Georgies> No
[14:15] <Georgies> Just happened this morning
[14:16] <Georgies> When I woke up I noticed it
[14:16] <Georgies> Yesterday it worked fine
[14:16] <Georgies> Could it just be my dns servers?
[14:16] <pynki> Georgies, can ping the ip?
[14:17] <pynki> sure you can, sorry, gettin a 404..
[14:17] <Georgies> PING ppa.launchpad.net (91.189.95.83) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from haetae.canonical.com (91.189.95.83): icmp_seq=1 ttl=54 time=16.1 ms
[14:17] <Georgies> So yes
[14:17] <Georgies> Hmm
[14:18] <pynki> and the release fiel is there :/
[14:18] <pynki> apt-get clean @Georgies
[14:18] <pynki> thatchanges anything?
[14:18] <Georgies> Let me try it
[14:19] <Georgies> Changed nothing
[14:19] <Georgies> :(
[14:19] <Georgies> I did apt-get update after
[14:19] <ducasse> Georgies: it looks a lot like a temporary error, i've seen similar things before
[14:19] <pynki> Gerogies, where are you located?
[14:19] <Georgies> EU
[14:19] <pynki> i have these issues here in china alot
[14:20] <Georgies> Oh. I see
[14:20] <pynki> free EU or some like UK?
[14:20] <pynki> as soon as they start tampering with conenctions....
[14:21] <Georgies> Oh you mean the government is trying to tamper with my connection?
[14:21] <Georgies> That's unlikely since its UK based
[14:21] <Georgies> I wouldn't see why the UK would do that
[14:21] <compdoc> how would you know?
[14:22] <Georgies> True
[14:22] <Georgies> But they are communists
[14:22] <Georgies> :>
[14:22] <ikonia> they would have to have a pretty good reason to do so
[14:22] <Georgies> aren't*
[14:22] <marcarrelus> ah, shame you guys are leaving :p
[14:22] <Georgies> Well we just host game servers
[14:22] <Georgies> so.
[14:22] <ikonia> the UK has to have a certain level of approval to interact with someones internet, which is logged and recorded
[14:22] <Georgies> Again, we do game servers
[14:22] <Georgies> Minecraft at that
[14:23] <Georgies> I doubt the UK is interested in a Minecraft Network
[14:23] <Georgies> Just sayn
[14:23] <marcarrelus> national security is very important
[14:23] <Georgies> xD
[14:23] <marcarrelus> terrorists organizing themself through minecraft are a known issue
[14:23] <Georgies> Totes agree with that, forgot Minecraft is a matter of National Security
[14:23] <mikhael_k33hl> EriC^^: got an error saying Grub failed to install at /target/
[14:23] <xplora1a> Georgies, can you get to launchpad.net with a browser?
[14:23] <Georgies> You guy's are funny
[14:23] <Georgies> Yes
[14:24] <Georgies> On my local pc
[14:24] <Georgies> Let me try curl
[14:24] <sansay> ##pagespeed
[14:24] <sansay> sorry about that
[14:24] <Georgies> Great, curl isnt installed since it's a minimal server install
[14:24] <Georgies> wget <3
[14:25] <Georgies> interesting
[14:25] <Georgies> My host machine is altering it
[14:25] <Georgies> Sorry for your time
[14:25] <Georgies> I figured it out
[14:25] <Georgies> <_>
[14:25] <Georgies> lolz
[14:26] <looq> hello
[14:27] <xplora1a> Georgies, what was the problem?
[14:31] <sansay> hey guys, after  compiling a binary from source how to i install it into nginx system?
[14:31] <sansay> ubuntu system**
[14:31] <ikonia> install it into ?
[14:31] <ikonia> nginx is a web server.....
[14:32] <pynki> what do you mean with "install into"
[14:32] <marcarrelus> sansay: start with telling which kind of binary? is it a web service?
[14:32] <sansay> okay so i compiled nginx from source, and did make install
[14:33] <sansay> when i type "nginx" in the command line it says you can install nginx using the following command
[14:33] <sansay> The program 'nginx' can be found in the following packages:  * nginx-core
[14:33] <marcarrelus> is there a specific reason that you would want to compile it from source?
[14:33] <pynki> ln -s /where/ever/it/is/installed/to/nginx /bin/nginx
[14:33] <sansay> ya i need to add pagespeed module to it
[14:34] <sansay> ah
[14:34] <sansay> any idea how to figure out where it installed
[14:34] <ikonia> sansay: you compiled it - you should know where you put it
[14:34] <pynki> apt-get install locate && updatedb && locate nginx
[14:34] <ikonia> it really sounds like you shouldn't be doing this
[14:34] <ikonia> no, that won't work
[14:34] <ikonia> it will only work if you've put it in the search path locations
[14:34] <sansay> ah i see
[14:35] <sansay> so it would be in the folder where it was compiled? in objs ?
[14:35] <ikonia> sansay: depends on how you compiled it
[14:35] <ikonia> sansay: have you actually looked if you can make the module you want work with the ubuntu install ?
[14:35] <marcarrelus> sansay: just as a side-note. Apache can be much more convenient when plugins are needed. No need for manually compiling
[14:36] <sansay> https://modpagespeed.com/doc/build_ngx_pagespeed_from_source
[14:36] <sansay> just from the official source seems thats how they do it
=== czesmir_ is now known as czesmir
[14:36] <ikonia> sansay: it really sounds as if this isn't something you should be doing with your current understanding
[14:36] <Sparrow__> sansay, You know that nginx 1.10 ? is in our repos
[14:37] <marcarrelus> Sparrow__, I guess he specifically wants this plugin.
[14:37] <ikonia> sansay: I think the build options don't contain the modes he wants
[14:37] <sansay> ya i need pagespeed, otherwise i would install from the package manager
[14:38] <sansay> is compiling from source that complicated that i shouldnt even bother?
[14:38] <ioria> sansay, you can add that module also building the   official ubuntu source : https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-install-nginx-and-google-pagespeed-on-ubuntu-16-04/
[14:38] <ikonia> sansay: I'd certainly question it with your current understanding
[14:40] <sansay> after i run make install is there a way to undo that?
[14:40] <ikonia> some packages have make uninstall
[14:40] <tezogmix> which version of ubuntu would you think would run ok for firefox browsing with some html5 (e.g. youtube) on an 32-bit intel core duo 1gb ram laptop?
[14:40] <ikonia> tezogmix: xubuntu or lubuntu
[14:41] <sansay> ah ty, this one does not
[14:41] <pynki> https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-install-nginx-and-google-pagespeed-on-ubuntu-16-04/ maybe this way is better than
[14:41] <Sparrow__> tezogmix, 32 Bit... really
[14:41] <pynki> @sansay
[14:41] <sansay> thanks, im following that now
[14:42] <sansay> do you know what will happen with the current rogue nginx install?
[14:42] <pynki> it will idle until next reinstall
[14:42] <sansay> kk
[14:42] <pynki> perhaps catch some dust
[14:42] <tezogmix> thanks ikonia , will either run alright from a 16gb usb drive for the above purpose with the max 4gb persistence enabled? like from the pendrivelinux/UUI? currently, the laptop only has 40gb hdd and has windows 7 on it.
[14:42] <sansay> lol maybe ill wipe the server and start over after
[14:42] <ioria> God knows
[14:42] <sansay> once i figure out how to get this setup proper
[14:43] <ikonia> tezogmix: I personally don't like running from pendrives, so I'd give you an personal opinion rather than what you want
[14:44] <Sparrow__> ikonia, Do you know when we are losing 32 bit support. Soon I think.
[14:45] <ikonia> Sparrow__: I don't to be honest,
[14:45] <tezogmix> understand ikonia , wasn't using it to run any other software/downloading... Sparrow__ is that for all versions of ubuntu? rumored eta? Some of the LTS looks to be for a few more years.
[14:45] <pynki> Sparrow__, a LTS has 4 or 5 years support? then he is good until at least 2020
[14:46] <ikonia> tezogmix: the fact that it needs to run from ram and swap out the file system on the USB is not a method I like, I like it even less on lower spec machines
[14:46] <Sparrow__> ikonia, I agree, pendrive AND persistence sounds like a way to kill some flash drives
[14:46] <Southern_Gentlem> ???
[14:47] <Southern_Gentlem> Sparrow__, only when the persistence fills up then you have to wipe the drive and start over
[14:47] <Sparrow__> At least three Linux distros have already quit releasing 32-bit versions, and Ubuntu seems to be standing in line to do the same. Is the end at hand for 32-bit mainstream distros?
[14:48] <Southern_Gentlem> Sparrow__, i have flash drives with persistance that have been running for years
[14:48] <nacc> Sparrow__: yes
[14:48] <tezogmix> ikonia, i was trying linux mint mate just from a few days back with a similar usb setup... and was curious to see if xbunutu/lubuntu would run slightly differently (possibly, a little more smoother?) you make a good point nevertheless on reasons, didn't consider the drawbacks on even lower spec'd machines.
[14:48] <ioria> Sparrow__, here they say "With Ubuntu 18.10 support for 32-bit PCs will disappear completely"  http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/06/ubuntu-drop-32-bit-desktop-iso-image-installer
[14:48] <ikonia> tezogmix: it will be ball park the same
[14:48] <tezogmix> i see ikonia ...
[14:48] <dar123> hey guyz, one of my applications is sending out emails as root <no-reply@domain>. How can i get it rid of root
[14:48] <ikonia> tezogmix: keep in mind thats a personal opinion though
[14:48] <ikonia> dar123: config the application
[14:48] <tezogmix> no doubt, appreciate the insight ikonia ...
[14:49] <dar123> tried multiple things on my posfix/main.cf
[14:49] <pynki> 18.04 will give us time until '22. who knows if we are not already have 128 bit until then...
[14:49] <ikonia> dar123: thats the MTA - you configure the from address/reply address in the application normally
[14:49] <tezogmix> i read that tails version 3.0 is stopping 32bit support.
[14:49] <tezogmix> so it's interesting to hear what Sparrow__ said re: 32bit phase-outs...
[14:50] <ligy> hi
[14:50] <Sparrow__> http://fossforce.com/2016/07/32-bit-nearing-end-life-linux/
[14:50] <ligy> anyone?
[14:51] <pynki> hi
[14:51] <tezogmix> from july 2016, wonder if we have any newer update news on that Sparrow__ (thanks for that link)
[14:51] <ligy> hi
[14:51] <Sparrow__> and the biggie.. Google Chrome is to drop support for all 32-bit Linux distros from March, 2016
[14:51] <tezogmix> oh yeah?
[14:51] <nacc> seems odd to say "is to drop" for something > year ago
[14:51] <frozenrouter> well, we are getting towards the point where most 32-bit only machines cannot reasonably run the software provided in your average desktop distro, so it will probably not cause much disturbance.
[14:51] <Sparrow__> Old article for reference
[14:51] <pynki> thats one of the things you should compile by yopurself
[14:51] <tezogmix> well chrome i remember stopped vista windows support much earlier than their windows EOL....
=== saintis- is now known as saintis
[14:51] <ioria> nacc, good point
[14:52] <nacc> beyond hardware limitation itself, there's no reason to run 32-bit anymore afaict
[14:52] <estranger> when did they stop making 32bit x86? 12-15 years ago?
[14:52] <dar123> ikonia: On the application i could only set the email no-reply@domain.
[14:52] <Sparrow__> They drop 32 bit support and no one noticed
[14:52] <akik> frozenrouter: how many apps do you have that require 3 gigs of ram per process?
[14:53] <sansay> interesting enough, that article says to edit the rules, but in the rules they are telling me to edit do not exist lol
[14:53] <pynki> nacc - oracle java on systems with less that 4gb ram would be one reason
[14:53] <frozenrouter> not so much memory for me, as the computational limits of the cpu are the problem
[14:53] <nacc> pynki: oracle java is not an ubuntu package :)
[14:53] <hateball> akik: any given modern game easily hogs that much. or a browser :)
[14:53] <tezogmix> interestingly, i think a lot of people are still running FF32-bit on 64bit systems no?
[14:53] <ikonia> dar123: then it's not sending that information to the mail server
[14:53] <estranger> 32gb heaps w/ g1gc baby
[14:53] <nacc> tezogmix: applications can stay 32-bit, if they want (afaict)
[14:54] <wadie> Hi fellows, I need help removing DRM from an ebook on Ubuntu..any ideas ?
[14:54] <nacc> wadie: afaict, that's illegal to do normally
[14:54] <frozenrouter> Even my current computer, with a fairly recent 64-bit cpu and 6gb of ram is using less than 2gb of ram, just below it's normal workload
[14:54] <nacc> wadie: so is not ontopic for this channel
[14:55] <wadie> nacc I wanna read the ebook on multiple devices..nothing illegal about that
[14:55] <tezogmix> https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Roadmap
[14:56] <tezogmix> ^^ to 64bit FF
[14:56] <frozenrouter> akik: What i have found is that the 32-bit only cpu's I have used recently are heavily constrained by the cpu rather than the memory for normal applications
[14:56] <tezogmix> Firefox 2017 Strategy & Roadmap (correct title to mozilla wiki link above)
[14:57] <akik> frozenrouter: to me 32-bit vs 64-bit question is of no value. we used 32-bit for a long time, we'll use 64-bit for a long time
[14:57] <pynki> hmm 2018/8 the installer is aware of 64bit...
[14:57] <frozenrouter> Have ubuntu started providing 64-bit firefox by default for compatable releases? I remember having trouble getting hold of 64-bit firefox a while ago.
[14:57] <tezogmix> Q2 will also see the release of our first 64-bit aware installer that helps users of Windows 64-bit systems get 64-bit Firefox. Finally, Web Extensions in Firefox will reach reasonable parity with Chrome.
[14:58] <tezogmix> i wonder how our FF-plugins are going to play with this....
[14:58] <nacc> wadie: removing drm is illegal. most ebooks tha come with drm say that on the frontpiece
[14:59] <pynki> nacc, and if they say "green is now blue" - is it?
[14:59] <nacc> pynki: no idea what you're talking about?
[14:59] <frozenrouter> akik: makes sense, since we will take a long time to commonly saturate the memory limits of 64 bit, besides, in my normal use of a system, the cpu becomes a limit for most tasks even before i am using 4gb of ram, and that is on a fairly power 64 bit cpu.

[15:00] <pynki> nacc, the y can print what ever on a ebook. if his local laws allow him to do it then he can do it - besides that he can do it and live with the consquences. that its not allow to discuss here, totally understandable
[15:01] <nacc> pynki: right, so why did you point that out to me? to be offtopic about offtopic matters?
[15:02] <wadie> nacc no, but just so you know how to handle such questions next time. I didn't ask for a legal advice :)
[15:02] <akik> frozenrouter: what some people don't know is that you can have more than 4 gigs of memory on a x86 system. it just limits the per process memory usage
[15:02] <wadie> anyway I got it..thanks
[15:02] <nacc> !guidelines | wadie
[15:02] <ubottu> wadie: The guidelines for using the Ubuntu channels can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines
[15:03] <nacc> wadie: if you would like to assert you live somewhere where removing DRM is not illegal (which you haven't), then you can do that
[15:04] <frozenrouter> akik: I remember reading about that, but have never seen it in action on a 32bit processor, where I have never been able to install more than 4gb of memory into the system and have it recognised. I have seen this with 32 bit applications on 64-bit systems
[15:04] <frozenrouter> I am forgetting to account for swap however
[15:06] <pynki> where do the guidelines say that its not allowed to talk about - maybe - illegal things?
[15:06] <sansay> does anyone know how i can see what is the default configuration params passed to the nginx packaged install?
[15:06] <sansay> is
[15:07] <frozenrouter> akik: Is there a relatively simple way for me to set that up on one of my 32-bit processor systems, it seems like an interesting concept to observe at low levels.
[15:08] <akik> frozenrouter: well do you have a system that supports more than 4 gigs of ram?
[15:08] <akik> frozenrouter: just use a i386 ubuntu iso and see what happens
[15:10] <frozenrouter> if the fact that those systems have x86-64 processors will not affect it, I will do that when I can leave a system installing, thanks! :)
[15:10] <akik> frozenrouter: back in time, there were different kernels for red hat (bigmem, hugemem)
[15:10] <akik> frozenrouter: they're backwards compatible

[15:22] <scorpion> any one around?
[15:22] <scorpion> I got a question
[15:22] <nacc> !ask | scorpion
[15:22] <ubottu> scorpion: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[15:22] <Seveas> scorpion: no, we're all out getting drunk :)
[15:22] <kantlivelong> .bang
[15:23] <scorpion> how do I know ahead of time if a distro is going to be compatable with fglrx prop driver?
[15:23] <kantlivelong> .bang
[15:23] <nacc> kantlivelong: please stop
[15:23] <scorpion> other than 14.04.1 Ubuntu
[15:23] <scorpion> I don't know any
[15:23] <kantlivelong> wha?
[15:23] <scorpion> i wanna install prop AMD drivers
[15:23] <kantlivelong> wat am i doing?
[15:23] <scorpion> fglrx
[15:23] <Seveas> scorpion: all versions of ubuntu can use that.
[15:23] <nacc> kantlivelong: you are typing '.bang'
[15:23] <scorpion> and EVERY distro i use fails
[15:23] <kantlivelong> oh lol
[15:23] <nacc> Seveas: not true, fglrx is gone
[15:23] <kantlivelong> weird
[15:23] <scorpion> except for ubuntu 14.04.1
[15:24] <scorpion> I end up with a black login screen
[15:24] <jackhum> in ubuntu if i close spotify , i think it should still continue playing music because it is in sound indicator as a service . why is this not happening
[15:24] <scorpion> level 1
[15:24] <kantlivelong> not sure why its going to this channel
[15:24] <scorpion> run
[15:24] <ash_workz> where is the recommended place for aliases? It's not .bashrc anymore right? I thought maybe it was bash_profile, but I saw online something like bash_aliases ?
[15:24] <jackhum> i have 2 music app , when i close those they stop playing music
[15:24] <Seveas> nacc: oh. TIL. I'm out of date :)
[15:24] <kantlivelong> nacc: thx for letting me know
[15:24] <scorpion> Definately NOT every distro is compatable with fglrx
[15:24] <scorpion> unless you know of a better driver to use with my ancient HD 7570
[15:24] <Seveas> jackhum: no, the indicator doesn't keep the music going. It just indicates that there's music being played
[15:24] <nacc> scorpion: look in the logs for why it failed with the newer HWE kernel?
[15:25] <nacc> scorpion: nothing wrong with using 14.04.1, btw
[15:25] <nacc> scorpion: if you have old hardware
[15:25] <Seveas> ash_workz: .bashrc works just fine.
[15:25] <scorpion> i remember why it fails
[15:25] <scorpion> it said it was unable to open /dev/ttyo
[15:25] <scorpion> in my xorg log file
[15:25] <ash_workz> Seveas: I thought that wasn't recommended for one reason or another
[15:25] <nacc> ash_workz: not recommended by whom?
[15:26] <nacc> scorpion: 14.04.1 is supported as long as 14.04.5 is
[15:26] <Seveas> ash_workz: if anyone ever recommended that, I'd argue they're wrong :)
[15:26] <ash_workz> nacc: I thought I read that in the docs somewhere
[15:26] <nacc> scorpion: *but* note to not confuse hwe level vs. distro level
[15:26] <jackhum> Seveas, okay , but can i do something so that i can kill music app , and it keeps running in sound indicator panel instead of showing it in my dock
[15:26] <Seveas> jackhum: no.
[15:26] <ash_workz> clearly I'm wrong
[15:26] <ash_workz> glad I checked though
[15:26] <scorpion> If I try to install fglrx on a brand new install of 17.04, i reboot to a black login screen
[15:26] <nacc> scorpion: fglrx doesn't exist anymore
[15:26] <nacc> scorpion: it makes no sense to install it on 17.04
[15:27] <Seveas> ash_workz: you can make your dotfiles as complicated as you want. My setup for instance is fairly complicated :)
[15:27] <jackhum> Seveas, i think this was there in earlier version . i dont want to see applications at launcher
[15:27] <nacc> scorpion: there is only amdgpu and then amdgpu-pro, iirc
[15:27] <scorpion> How do I get propietary drivers on newer kernel?
[15:27] <scorpion> I have a Radeon HD 7570
[15:27] <scorpion> ddr5 1gig
[15:27] <tgm4883> scorpion: generally you don't need them, they are either supported by Radeon or AMDGPU
[15:27] <ioria> scorpion, sy, how can you install fglrx on zesty ?
[15:27] <nacc> scorpion: you don't.
[15:28] <scorpion> I was only able to install fglrx on 14.04.1
[15:28] <Seveas> nacc: is amdgpu foss or proprietary? Or where can I read more about this? :)
[15:28] <nacc> Seveas: amdgpu is open, in the kernel
[15:28] <nacc> Seveas: i believe amdgpu-pro is the proprietary equiv. but i'm no tsure
[15:28] <nacc> scorpion: yes, you can only install it on 14.04
[15:28] <nacc> scorpion: if you want fglrx stay on 14.04
[15:29] <tgm4883> amdgpu-pro is the proprietary one, although I think it just adds some features not generally needed for 3d acceleration
[15:29] <scorpion> does the Radeon Driver provide better performance than fglrx?
[15:29] <nacc> scorpion: if your hardware is working, there is no reason to use 14.04.5 v. 14.04.1 afaict
[15:29] <tgm4883> scorpion: being the FGLRX doesn't exist anymore, yes?
[15:29] <Seveas> scorpion: did you see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AMDGPU-PRO-Driver ?
[15:29] <nacc> scorpion: seems unlikely
[15:29] <scorpion> fglrx does exist lol
[15:30] <nacc> scorpion: no, it doesn't, not on 16.04+
[15:30] <scorpion> i guess its just not being developed any more
[15:30] <nacc> scorpion: it exists *for* 14.04
[15:30] <scorpion> is the open source driver gonna be able to provide any 3d performance for my card?
[15:31] <scorpion> sorry to ask so many questions but its not often i find people that know what they are talking about lol
[15:31] <nacc> scorpion: depends on the card. I believe older hardware is less well supported, but i'm not sure
[15:31] <ioria> scorpion, yes
[15:31] <Seveas> scorpion: best way to find that out is to try it and see
[15:31] <ioria> scorpion, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
[15:32] <scorpion> i only have a 8800 GT,   an 8800 GTX , and an AMD HD 7570 ddr5
[15:32] <scorpion> so I don't have many choices for video card to make a light steam gaming pc
[15:32] <Seveas> according to what I find with google, the amdgpu-pro driver (proprietary replacement for fglrx) supports the 7570
[15:32] <Seveas> and the 8800

[15:33] <scorpion> gt 610
[15:33] <ioria> scorpion, ah
[15:33] <Xtreme> hello, Got a odd and challenging question. Kinda betting you guys never faced this one before.
[15:33] <scorpion> i have an ati x800 aswell
[15:34] <scorpion> whats up Xtreme?
[15:34] <Xtreme> I want to set up two login passwords for my user account. No, not "wither one or another", but both. Like 2fa but with password
[15:34] <scorpion> hmmmmmmmm
[15:34] <Seveas> Xtreme: I have in fact implemented such a thing the other day....
[15:34] <Xtreme> Like, you login with password a, then it asks again, where you have to enter password b.
[15:34] <scorpion> giving your best friend access to your porn collection?
[15:34] <plshelps> need help to setup my keyboard after user remove, apreciatcha!
[15:34] <Seveas> Xtreme: so, you lost your bet :)
[15:34] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: No, both are required to log in, not either.
[15:34] <Xtreme> scorpion, exactly the opposite.
[15:35] <scorpion> what are you trying to do because I bet there is a better solution you haven't thought of yet Xtreme
[15:35] <pynki> Xtreme: easy. just reimplement "login"
[15:35] <Xtreme> scorpion, its a + b
[15:35] <Xtreme> Seveas, i am happy and sad.
[15:35] <Xtreme> How you did that?
[15:35] <Seveas> pam magic
[15:35] <Xtreme> pynki, explain please
[15:36] <Seveas> Xtreme: have you ever played with pam configurations?
[15:36] <scorpion> you guys should check out Jitsi
[15:36] <Xtreme> Seveas, yeah.
[15:36] <Xtreme> Implemented 2fa with the same. but google authenticator.
[15:36] <ChaiTRex> Jitsi was ugly last time I saw it.
[15:36] <scorpion> it lets you give a small url to people that you can goto to share your screen, whiteboard, and skype like functionalitym, with NO LOGINS
[15:36] <Xtreme> was tinkering it a bit so it only asks for few things and not for others.
=== jamie_2 is now known as jamie_1
[15:37] <scorpion> jitsi is amazing now
[15:37] <Seveas> Xtreme: good. Then I'll just say pam_extrausers :) have a required on pam_unix and (for select users on pam_extrausers)
[15:37] <scorpion> and being able to put it on your own webserver, or even host with your linux box, is freaking awesome
[15:37] <riidom> how can I figure out where evince is installed, please? I need to point another application towards it
[15:37] <scorpion> jitsi did alot of bug fixes and stablization over the last year
[15:37] <s_kilk> I've got this weird issue that's started in the last few days (16.04), the gnome keyring doesn't unlock on login anymore. Meaning ssh, chromium etc, will prompt for keyring unlock on first use. Anyone any idea why that would be?
[15:38] <Xtreme> Seveas, thank you. Looking into it.
[15:38] <Seveas> Xtreme: I'll leave the problem of how to populate /var/lib/extrausers/ as an exercise for the reader...
[15:38] <ChaiTRex> riidom: Run `which evince`
[15:38] <pynki> Xtreme, https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow this should be the source code for user login - just add your needs
[15:38] <scorpion> okay guys.    power users, whats your partition scheme for installing??  which directories do you give their own partition on the HDD and how big?
[15:38] <Xtreme> But just to make sure we both understood each other correctly. we are talking about a + b and not a or b.
[15:38] <riidom> ty ChaiTRex
[15:38] <Xtreme> pynki, taking a look at it as well.
[15:38] <Seveas> pynki: that's entirely unnecessary. pam lets you do this without any code modifications.
[15:38] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: One big partition and a small one for swap.
[15:39] <scorpion> really?
[15:39] <scorpion> no /boot  no /tmp
[15:39] <tgm4883> scorpion: don't poll the channel
[15:39] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: That way, there's no worries about filling one of many up and having to resize.
[15:39] <Seveas> !poll
[15:39] <scorpion> what about /var
[15:39] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: I have /tmp in RAM.
[15:39] <tgm4883> scorpion: one / one SWAP
[15:39] <scorpion> ohhhh I was wondering how to do that
[15:39] <Seveas> scorpion: there is no such thing as an optimal partition scheme. Depends on the use case.
[15:39] <scorpion> i heard about that
[15:39] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: Ahh, yes, for UEFI, I have /boot/efi or something on a separate partition.
[15:39] <ioria> scorpion, have you already tried that  HD 7570 on zesty ?
[15:40] <scorpion> sorry to poll, but NO one i've ever met in real life uses linux so when I find you guys im going to ask questions
[15:40] <Seveas> e.g. I have everything except /boot as encrypted lvm. But on most of my servers I don't.
[15:40] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: If you have a lot of RAM, `tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,mode=1777 0 0` in /etc/fstab
[15:40] <Xtreme> Seveas, I hope the answer to my question is yes. Now if i understood extrausers correctly, the steps are.
[15:40] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: Then, boot to single user mode, erase everything in /tmp (don't delete /tmp itself, though).
[15:40] <scorpion> does that mean that ALL temp files in the whole system get funneled through that ram disk?
[15:41] <Xtreme> 1: create /var/lib/extrausers/passwd and /var/lib/extrausers/shadow and copy set up second password there.
[15:41] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: No, most things don't use /tmp. Like browser caches are in ~/.cache.
[15:41] <Xtreme> 2: modify my pam.d/x file and set it up as another authenticator parameter
[15:41] <Xtreme> right?
[15:41] <Seveas> correct
[15:41] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: /tmp isn't used all that much these days.
[15:42] <scorpion> okay then maybe what I'm thinking of is maybe making a partition on my ssd that acts as a buffer for my spinny hd
[15:42] <mikecmpbll> how can i start a user service (systemd) as root?
[15:42] <scorpion> would that offer any performanfce benifit?
[15:42] <Seveas> I'd do something like: auth required pam_unix.so ; auth [success=ok, default=ignore] pam_succeed_if.so use_uid uid > 1000; auth required pam_extrausers.so
[15:42] <ChaiTRex> mikecmpbll: Usually `sudo service whatever start`
[15:42] <Seveas> Xtreme: that way the extra passowrd only applies to 'normal' users and you have root as an escape hatch if you screw up :)
[15:43] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: Yes, if the caching is done well. I'm not sure how to set that up, though.
[15:43] <mikecmpbll> ChaiTRex : says not found. i can use `systemctl --user ...` as the user, but when i `sudo su` to root, i can't interact with it
[15:43] <Xtreme> But that you will do in common auth
[15:44] <ChaiTRex> mikecmpbll: Sorry, not sure then.
[15:44] <Xtreme> which sudo will also inherit.
[15:44] <Seveas> Xtreme: depends on where you want this. Could be in common-auth, could be in sshd...
[15:44] <Xtreme> so maybe, i should do that for mdm & login
[15:44] <Seveas> I generally only care about sshd when I do this kind of config
[15:45] <mikecmpbll> if i try sudo su - deploy -c 'systemctl --user ...' i get "Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory"
[15:45] <Xtreme> btw, i think my root login is disabled. How can i be 100% sure about it?
[15:45] <Seveas> try logging in as root :)
[15:45] <Xtreme> lol
[15:45] <scorpion> man it seems like left 4 dead 2 stutters no matter whether I play it on my 16 core Ryzen 1700x or my 4 core q9450 core 2 quad
[15:46] <scorpion> whether i use rx 480 or this crappy hd 7570.   stutters on literally every os and hardware I have
[15:46] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: sudo cat /etc/shadow, see if the `root` line starts with `root:!`
[15:47] <akik> mikecmpbll: maybe compare the "env" when the user service works and when it doesn't (sudo su - user)
[15:47] <Xtreme> ChaiTRex, yes there is. and Yes, its not disabled.. Will removing that line disable login completely?
[15:47] <mikecmpbll> akik : good idea, thanks i'll check that out
[15:47] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: Do not remove that line. The system depends on it.
[15:47] <Xtreme> LOL. good i asked
[15:47] <Xtreme> :D
[15:48] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: The ! means it's disabled.
[15:48] <Xtreme> scorpion, isnt that 8 core cpu?
[15:48] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: According to `man passwd`.
[15:48] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: See the `-l` option there.
[15:48] <Xtreme> aah okay. so yes, it has that line, but it doesnt have !
[15:49] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: Without the !, the account is enabled.
=== virtualriot is now known as sweetheart
[15:49] <Xtreme> okay. so adding ! first.
[15:49] <Seveas> Xtreme: does it look like this: root:$6$U42VdWnf$u499wMz4......
[15:49] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: You can use `sudo passwd -l root` to lock it.
[15:49] <Seveas> don't manually edit the file please
[15:49] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: Don't edit /etc/shadow directly.
[15:50] <Seveas> too easy to make mistake :)
[15:50] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: If you screw up, it can screw things up.
[15:50] <Xtreme> okay :) Thanks. I used the passwd -l
[15:50] <undil> hiiiy
[15:50] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: Is there now a !?
[15:51] <Xtreme> Seveas, yes it was that way first. ChaiTRex Yup, now it has !
[15:51] <ChaiTRex> Xtreme: OK, you're good now :)
[15:51] <tgm4883> scorpion: I don't recall stuttering issues when I was playing that on my older boxes. I recall having many issues on 16.04 with my RX480 (which I got rid of) so you might try 17.04 with it now
[15:51] <Xtreme> and i like the "This option disables a password by changing it to a value which matches no possible encrypted value" part.
[15:51] <tgm4883> or you could just stop buying AMD
[15:51] <Xtreme> interesting
[15:52] <Xtreme> tgm4883, AMD is not BAD.
[15:52] <scorpion> @tgm4883  What driver were you using for the rx 480
[15:52] <Seveas> merely evil
[15:52] <tgm4883> scorpion: I tried both AMDGPU and AMDGPU-PRO
[15:52] <scorpion> AMD at least makes an attempt to be part of the linux and open source community
[15:53] <tgm4883> Xtreme: in theory, no they aren't.
[15:53] <scorpion> nvidia doesn't care for us at all
[15:53] <Xtreme> I have around 12 AMD FX8 systems. and they beat the other Intel systems any given time. (got around 16 intel systems)
=== zwischenzug2 is now known as zwischenzug
[15:53] <scorpion> im gonna atleast support the company that is trying to give us other options besides microsoft and being slaves to our own hardware and software
[15:53] <tgm4883> This seems very off topic for this channel, if only there was a channel for offtopic discussion...
[15:54] <scorpion> unless nvidia provides a nessecary feature, I try to buy amd to support what they are doing for us
[15:54] <pynki> scorpion, like cuda?
[15:54] <pynki> some s**t needs it :/
[15:54] <Xtreme> Seveas, okay. Can you please point me towards the right way in populating /var/lib/extrausers/passwd and /var/lib/extrausers/shadow for my user only?
[15:54] <scorpion> Im happy just to see activity on the channel regardless of off topic or not... Man people just wanna talk, its okay
[15:55] <treaki> hi
[15:55] <scorpion> yes like cuda, but you don't always need cuda for everything
[15:55] <treaki> does anybody has access to http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/17.04/release/
[15:55] <tgm4883> !ot | scorpion no, there's a reason for it
[15:55] <ubottu> scorpion no, there's a reason for it: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please register with NickServ (see /msg ubottu !register) and use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[15:55] <pynki> Xtreme, better to create a dummy/test user for rthat
[15:55] <treaki> i have lost mine just one moment ago
[15:55] <treaki> and i need an iso
[15:55] <treaki> is there a mirror?
[15:55] <mikecmpbll> akik : great suggestion, was XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 env var that made it work with su
[15:55] <tgm4883> treaki: what do you mean you lost access? It works here?
[15:55] <scorpion> oh okay I get it.  I do come here for support, but sometimes just seeing channel activity makes me more likely to speak up and ask for support
[15:56] <pynki> treaki, link works fine
[15:56] <scorpion> If the channels dead and no one talks im likely to try somewhere else
[15:56] <treaki> my browser isnt able to load any page under that domain
[15:56] <tgm4883> scorpion: then you don't understand how support channels work
[15:56] <tgm4883> treaki: can you resolve that domain to an IP address?
[15:56] <scorpion> i do, but dead channels usually stay dead...
[15:56] <pynki> treaki, bottorrent
[15:56] <pynki> bit
[15:56] <treaki> thats an idea...
[15:57] <treaki> but i heared people got blamed by law (or how to say it in english) for using it
[15:57] <akik> mikecmpbll: nice!
[15:57] <DArqueBishop> scorpion: this channel is active enough with support requests that offtopic chatter causes problems.
[15:57] <scorpion> you have to registor to join #ubuntu-offtopic?
[15:57] <tgm4883> scorpion: there's a difference between dead channels and quiet channels. The difference is usually the number next to "Users/Members/etc". In this case, I have trouble seeing a channel with 1900+ people as dead
[15:58] <pynki>  treaki https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors

[15:58] <treaki> ah, wget is working
[15:58] <tgm4883> treaki: you'd need to back that up with some sort of info. I don't see why that would get "blamed by law"
[15:58] <treaki> but i get only 300kbps where i should get 1,6 M
[15:59] <treaki> ah
[15:59] <treaki> now it is working
[15:59] <pynki> treaki, http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/ubuntu-releases/ try this one - should be quite near
[15:59] <treaki> lookes like my browser dosent liket that urls while it was able to open google and so on
=== cyber is now known as Guest63496
[15:59] <pynki> and rtwh works grat normally
[16:00] <treaki> now i am at 1,5 M..which is ok
[16:00] <treaki> browsers are just to complex to understand, i should use wget everytime in the future
[16:00] <treaki> i guess it was such a ipv4/v6 handover problem that i had just yesterday or something else
[16:00] <treaki> wget is now using v4 and i dont have any native v6
=== vincent__ is now known as Guest21619
[16:01] <treaki> i guess my browser thought it could be a good idea to use v6 and it failed...
[16:01] <treaki> or maybe i have to much addblocking addons installed
[16:02] <nKf> hi all. I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 and want to add an application to mime list (.config/mimeapps.list). But it doesn't work for desktop files that are in .local/share/applications. Select "open as" in nautilus also doesn't show the application, but the scope is able to find it. any ideas?
[16:02] <treaki> i hate such problems where you dont can find out what was the root of it
[16:02] <yochay> hello?
[16:02] <treaki> any idea how to investigate that?
[16:02] <treaki> hi yochay
[16:02] <yochay> hi
[16:02] <scorpion> im having a hard time getting a handle on the finer points of trouble shooting linux. When something goes wrong in windows, 99 percent of the time I can track it down and fix it.   When something breaks on my linux box and leaves me stuck with no GUI on a command line with no way to undo what i broke i feel so stupid...
[16:02] <treaki> and strangest thing, after browser restart, problem gone...
[16:02] <scorpion> I don't like when my os makes me feel stupid
[16:03] <Seveas> scorpion: I don't need an os for that :)
[16:03] <nacc> scorpion: beyond installing an unsupported package, what else have you done that 'broke' things?
[16:03] <treaki> scorpion, with me its completely the oposite, if something fails in linux, ill use my bash and find out whats the problem infact
[16:04] <treaki> (with tail and grep ant all them)
[16:04] <scorpion> I want to trust me
[16:04] <treaki> but on windows i am dammed to reinstall it
[16:04] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: There are tools to diagnose whatever, it's just learning that they exist and getting some practice with them.
[16:04] <scorpion> but when you only an intermediate user looking at the blinking black screen with no gui its a bit scary lol
[16:04] <nacc> primarily (IMO) it's reading logs and understanding them
[16:04] <treaki> but i think this problem could happen as well in windows if you just copy my firefox with the 100 addons or so over to there
[16:04] <scorpion> I have some decent CLI skills on linux
[16:04] <nacc> scorpion: you don't need a GUI to do anything then :)
[16:04] <nacc> scorpion: just login and find logs
[16:04] <treaki> scorpion, just ssh into your machine from another one
[16:04] <scorpion> I can move around, copy files, do some basic compiling,
[16:05] <scorpion> but as SOON as i start getting errors my whole life is over
[16:05] <nacc> scorpion: oh that's more "basic CLI skills"
[16:05] <scorpion> For example
[16:05] <treaki> i have used my computer a cupple of days before rebooting with a frozen screen do to broken grafic hardware;)
[16:05] <treaki> have a look at some basic unix tutorial
[16:05] <treaki> i have started back then with this one
[16:06] <treaki> http://rowa.giso.de/german/
[16:06] <scorpion> I tried to compile the quake 3 engine on the raspberry pi, it failed because it was looking for a dependant file in a certain place, that the developers of Raspbian had moved around, and if i had any clue what I was doing I would've been able fix that
[16:06] <treaki> its in german language, but i think you can just look up all the topics there to get a basic understanding of how to use the commandline
[16:06] <scorpion> literally only one file stopping me from compiling but I don't know how to include it
[16:06] <treaki> and if you once got used to it, you want miss it anymore and are installing cycwin on any windows you need to use for your job ;)
[16:07] <Giora> Hey is it possible to install gnome3 on ubuntu without compiz?
[16:07] <scorpion> And trying to google a solution wont work with this particular problem.
[16:07] <zootopia2> hi there ..
[16:07] <EriC^^> Giora: yes
[16:07] <treaki> scorpion, and whats the error message of that copy procces
[16:07] <treaki> and which software are you using to copy it?
[16:07] <Malsasa_> zootopia2, hello.
[16:07] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: Maybe the C or C++ channels for that sort of thing (specifying where a file is).
[16:07] <treaki> we can try to investigate if you like till my ubuntu is downloaded and installed...
[16:08] <zootopia2> I need help ..
[16:08] <scorpion> https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=178843&p=1139194
[16:08] <nacc> scorpion: there are better channels than this one for programming related help
[16:08] <treaki> zootopia2, dont ask to ask, just ask
[16:08] <ChaiTRex> treaki: I think WSL is giving Cygwin a run for its money.
[16:08] <scorpion> I posted my issue here, and NO ONE. Literally no one replied.
[16:08] <scorpion> not here, on that link I mean.
[16:08] <zootopia2> I move my home partition.
[16:08] <zootopia2> and now get this in dmesg
[16:08] <zootopia2> cgroup: new mount options do not match the existing superblock, will be ignored
[16:09] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: Yeah, most people here won't know, so they won't answer.
[16:09] <nacc> scorpion: not really an ubuntu issue if raspi forums are empty
[16:09] <scorpion> treaki, check the link I posted
[16:09] <treaki> ChaiTRex, i hate win10, and on my workplace there is still windows 7, and cygwin runs portable from a stick
[16:09] <ChaiTRex> scorpion: For example, I wouldn't know since I'm not proficient with C or C++>.
[16:09] <nacc> scorpion: the error is mssing libraries
[16:09] <EriC^^> zootopia2: show "sudo blkid" and "cat /etc/fstab"

[16:09] <treaki> of cause its not perfect, but its open source, so ill keep using it ;)
[16:09] <scorpion> yes a missing library
[16:09] <ChaiTRex> treaki: Ahh, good point.
[16:09] <Giora> scorpion: use any utility to find that file and pass -I<Path to folder> to gcc
[16:09] <nacc> zootopia2: tht's not an error, it can be ignored
[16:09] <punkboy> hi
[16:09] <nacc> scorpion: many missing libraries
[16:09] <nacc> scorpion: so isntall the missing libraries
[16:09] <treaki> ah i missed that because of it startet with raspi ;)
[16:09] <scorpion> i see hundreds of people with quake 3 on their pi and when I go to compile iu get that
[16:10] <treaki> your hollipi scorpion ?
[16:10] <nacc> scorpion: did you install all the needed dependnecies?
[16:10] <zootopia2> I changed fstab ..
[16:10] <scorpion> But heres the thing, I was following a tutorial using a fresh install of raspbian, it should've had all nessecary libraries
[16:10] <pynki> scorpion, see the pm

[16:10] <treaki> why compiling it the in the first place, isnt there a package in raspian with that engine?
[16:11] <scorpion> Yes I am Hollipl
[16:11] <zootopia2> I didn't change the PARTUUID ?
[16:11] <scorpion> i made that post
[16:11] <nacc> scorpion: um, there's no reason for all the libraries to beinstalled, and i don't know what tutorial you followed
[16:11] <akik> scorpion: did you make a web search for your problem? https://joshua14.homelinux.org/blog/?p=1715
[16:11] <treaki> https://packages.debian.org/sid/ioquake3
[16:11] <nacc> zootopia2: wht is your actual issue?
[16:11] <treaki> there, should be there on raspbian to
[16:12] <treaki> https://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianRepository page isnt loading but they have anytime less instead of more
[16:12] <tgm4883> I usually recommend a reinstall when I see "I've tried 15 different tutorials"
[16:12] <nacc> tgm4883: +1
[16:12] <zootopia2> i get a delay on boot and a complaint from dmsg: 'cgroup: new mount options do not match the existing superblock, will be ignored'

[16:12] <scorpion> This is the quake3 tutorial i followed
[16:13] <scorpion> sorry nacc
[16:13] <tgm4883> scorpion: sorry, your post cracks me up. There's no way to "I'm following the process precisely" when you "tried 15 different tutorials"
[16:16] <zootopia2> nacc: Well maybe I didn't notice before, a watch pot :)
[16:17] <zootopia2> 'watched pot' takes ages to boil ..
[16:17] <nacc> zootopia2: yeah, so the delay -- if you change your fstab back, does it go away?
[16:17] <ChaiTRex> zootopia2: One time I watched a pot, and the metal didn't start boiling until next week.
[16:18] <zootopia2> I tried replacing the UUID with /dev/sda2 .. no effect .. it's to do with cgroups ...

[16:55] <sorinello> Hello. Did anybody had issues with resolving local hostnames on 17.04 ? resolv.conf is nameserver 127.0.0.53, internet resolving works, but not the LAN. Any idea what could be the issue ?
[16:56] <compdoc> never seen the address 127.0.0.53 used before
[16:57] <nacc> compdoc: it's systemd-resolved, iirc
[16:57] <nacc> compdoc: the new default
[16:57] <sorinello> compdoc, yeah, I have set NetworkManager to 192.168.0.1, but resolv.conf is still 172.0.0.53
[16:58] <nacc> sorinello: do you have a LAN nameserver?
[16:58] <sorinello> nacc, yes, it's on my router.
[16:59] <sorinello> if I change resolv.conf to 192.168.0.1 everything works OK. Local and internet
[17:00] <nacc> sorinello: you need to probably edit /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
[17:00] <sorinello> nacc, yeah, instead of DNS= I've put DNS=192.168.0.1 .. and after a reboot no resolving works whatsoever
=== virtualriot is now known as sweetheart
[17:02] <tgm4883> sorinello: setting NM to 192.168.0.1 would mean that resolv.conf still has the .53 address, that is correct
[17:02] <sorinello> tgm4883, yes, that is correct. But seems wrong :)

[17:05] <tgm4883> sorinello: well for starters, making sure you're up to date. 172.0.0.53 is not the right address
=== revanthbs is now known as revanthbs_
[17:05] <tgm4883> Should be 127.0.0.53
[17:06] <sorinello> tgm4883, nameserver 127.0.0.53
[17:06] <sorinello> tgm4883, my bad, thpo. It is nameserver 127.0.0.53
=== revanthbs_ is now known as revanthbs
[17:07] <tgm4883> sorinello: can you resolve local FQDN?
[17:08] <sorinello> tgm4883, no, just internet ones.
[17:08] <tgm4883> sorinello: you connected to any VPNs?
[17:08] <sorinello> tgm4883, if I tell dig to use @192.168.0.1, it resolves local addresses. No, not connected to any VPN's, no wireless, only cable, simple static setup
[17:09] <tgm4883> sorinello: what's the output of "nmcli device show | grep IP4.DNS"
[17:11] <sobersabre> hi

[17:15] <tgm4883> sorinello: hmm, that all seems like it should be working then
[17:15] <tgm4883> sorinello: is 192.168.0.1 just a dumb router?
[17:15] <tgm4883> sorinello: just wondering if you can see DNS logs on it
[17:16] <nacc> sorinello: note also (sorry was afk) you cn run `systemd-resolve` with options to see what it's doing
[17:16] <sqll> what is the problem?

[17:19] <sorinello> tgm4883, nacc yes, one of the hosts (windows machine is resolved after 20 seconds of waiting) .. other linux hosts do not resolv at all

[17:22] <sorinello> ioria, server can't find balcora: SERVFAIL
[17:22] <ioria> sorinello, what's in /etc/resolv.conf ?
[17:22] <sorinello> ioria, nameserver 127.0.0.53
[17:23] <sorinello> ioria, if it help, pinging the host from windows cmd works instantly
[17:23] <jushur> sorinello: that should be 127.0.0.1:53 i belive
[17:23] <ioria> sorinello, resolv.conf will be overwritten so you can try a  sudo sh -c "echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 > /etc/resolv.conf"
[17:23] <sorinello> ioria, I know. But this does not solve the issue
[17:24] <nacc> jushur: no, not with systemd-resolved
[17:24] <sorinello> at the next reboot the resolv.conf is overwritten
[17:24] <ioria> sorinello, ok, but it works ?
[17:24] <nacc> sorinello: so in your current configuration, network names, work, but LAN names don't?
[17:24] <sorinello> ioria, not all local hostnames
[17:24] <nacc> sorinello: can you paostebin the output of `sytemd-resolve <hostname>` in both cases?
[17:25] <sorinello> nacc, exactly, lan names don't resolve

[17:28] <tgm4883> jushur: his IP is correct. Please read up on systemd and dnsmasq
[17:28] <akik> is the 127.0.0.53 the address for systemd-resolve or dnsmasq? before the dnsmasq process held 127.0.1.1

[17:43] <ioria> sorinello,  your /etc/hosts is correct ? i mean, well formatted
[17:44] <jushur> sorinello: dns domain is not a ip number
[17:44] <nacc> jushur: good catch, that's weird
[17:44] <nacc> jushur: sounds like a misadvertising DHCP server, maybe?
[17:45] <deemo> al203-cr: unexecutable because it was binary only readable. I could have checked this. >:-(
[17:46] <jushur> nacc: yes, or added entries in networkmanager options i supose could make that happen to.
[17:49] <nacc> jushur: right
[18:01] <jushur> sorinello: you have domainname set somewhere, to 192.168.0.1 wich is wrong. should be a "name" of some kind. like localdomain
[18:03] <sorinello> jushur, from NetworkManager UI, I have put 192.168.0.1 on DNS Servers and Search Domains
[18:06] <jushur> sorinello: only do that to dns not domains
[18:07] <jushur> sorinello: only dns server, that is
[18:08] <nacc> sorinello: ah, so user error :)
[18:09] <nacc> sorinello: your DNS server is not your domain name
[18:09] <jushur> sorinello: when you hold your mouse pointer over the field where you write in the setting you see a tooltip popup. read it. and you will understand why your computer cannot find other computers
[18:09] <sorinello> jushur, just done that, DNS Domain is now not listed at all (I left the field blank in NetworkManager), but still the same problem
[18:09] <nacc> sorinello: does systemd-resolve --status still say it's the domain name (it might need a reload or restart()
[18:09] <sorinello> nacc, no, I don't have a Domain Name at all now

[18:13] <sorinello> same :(
[18:15] <jushur> sorinello: and your router is set up so it will serve internal ips by computername.domainname requests?
[18:17] <jushur> sorinello: like you set a domainname on the routers LAN/WIFI interface and then use that on your local computers to.
[18:17] <sorinello> jushur, I will have to debug my dnsmasq (running openwrt)
[18:18] <jushur> sorinello: should be somewhere in the dhpcd config for your lan in openwrt

[18:23] <snjdfj> QUESTION!
[18:23] <snjdfj> How do I install SoftEther VPN host on 16.04?
[18:26] <tomreyn> snjdfj: unsupported / not in ubuntu, check with the developers.
[18:26] <snjdfj> ...
[18:27] <snjdfj> What's the suggested way for installing compiled applications on ubuntu?
[18:27] <tomreyn> you don't, unless they're packaged ;)
[18:28] <snjdfj> ,,,'
[18:28] <tgm4883> snjdfj: is it a single binary file?
[18:28] <snjdfj> That doesn't answer my question
[18:28] <tgm4883> snjdfj: if it is, you can stick it in ~/bin
[18:28] <snjdfj> tgm4883: Looks like it might not be.
[18:28] <snjdfj> That's the issue.
[18:28] <snjdfj> I'd rather not package it mysql
[18:28] <snjdfj> myself*
[18:28] <tgm4883> snjdfj: you'd need to look at the install docs for the application
[18:29] <snjdfj> No third party PPA's exist?
[18:29] <tgm4883> snjdfj: third party PPAs for what?
[18:29] <nacc> !ppa | snjdfj: you would need to search for them yourself
[18:29] <ubottu> snjdfj: you would need to search for them yourself: A Personal Package Archive (PPA) can provide alternate software not normally available in the offical Ubuntu repositories - Looking for a PPA?

[18:30] <snjdfj> blegh
[18:30] <snjdfj> I guess I'll just use OpenVPN instead of L2TP
[18:30] <jushur> snjdfj: https://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/7._Installing_SoftEther_VPN_Server/7.3_Install_on_Linux_and_Initial_Configurations
[18:30] <snjdfj> FreeRADIUS is too painful to work with to be worth it for L2TP
[18:30] <tgm4883> snjdfj: not really sure what you're expecting here
[18:31] <snjdfj> Just hoping I could do it painlessly
[18:31] <snjdfj> Outside of Windows VPN's can be pretty painful IMO
[18:31] <tgm4883> FreeRADIUS isn't painful IMO
[18:32] <tgm4883> I've had zero issues with openvpn in the past
[18:32] <tgm4883> setting up both the server and the client
[18:32] <snjdfj> My goal is native intigration
[18:32] <snjdfj> Hence not using OpenVPN
[18:33] <tgm4883> define "Native Integretion"
[18:33] <snjdfj> It's already part of the OS
[18:33] <snjdfj> OpenVPN requires extra software on the client, L2TP doesn't
[18:33] <ferd> Does anyone know about Panda Wireless/Ralink support on 17.04? My wireless adapters don't seem to be working on a fresh install
[18:34] <tgm4883> snjdfj: installing packages from the archive makes it not native?
[18:34] <ducasse> snjdfj: part of which os?
[18:34] <snjdfj> tgm4883: wat
[18:34] <DArqueBishop> Uh. Ubuntu has OpenVPN binaries available. I'm not sure how much more "part of the OS" you can get.
[18:34] <snjdfj> ducasse: OSX, Windows, Linux, *BSD
[18:34] <tgm4883> snjdfj: You install packages from the archive and it works....
[18:34] <daverGS> Hey, anyone here have some time to help me figure out some graphics issues with 16.04 LTS and a GTX 1060  :)
[18:35] <snjdfj> [11:33] <snjdfj> OpenVPN requires extra software on the client, L2TP doesn't
[18:35] <snjdfj> Platforms outside of Linux do exist.
[18:35] <nacc> snjdfj: there are two different statements you are making, it seems like. One is wehther openvpn is part of Ubuntu (it is). The other is about having to install a package or not.
[18:35] <tgm4883> snjdfj: ok, you have fun then...
[18:35] <nacc> snjdfj: you're in the ubuntu channel!
[18:35] <snjdfj> yes I know.
[18:35] <snjdfj> I'm mentioning the reason I wanted L2TP is native integration
[18:35]  * tgm4883 doesn't spoonfeed users
[18:35] <snjdfj> I don't need to get a external program.
[18:35]  * snjdfj doesn't need spoonfeeding
[18:35] <snjdfj> I'm trying to avoid the painful parts of setting up a VPN
[18:36] <DArqueBishop> Realizing this is kind of offtopic, I'd like to point out that in my career I've never worked anywhere that didn't use a third-party package for VPN access.
[18:36] <snjdfj> Little tidbit not mentioned in many documents is OpenVPN's server wont generate certs on 16.04 due to a missing config
[18:37] <snjdfj> DArqueBishop: my goal is to not have to setup more software on more devices.
[18:37] <daverGS> Has anyone had any luck getting graphics switching properly on 16.04 with a GTX 10 series?
[18:38] <A1Recon> I want to reinstall Ubuntu 16.04 on my PC which was dual-booted with Win10/Ubuntu16.04. UEFI is enabled. I am using a LiveUSB and I am currently in the menu where "i have to select the partition where Ubuntu has to be installed". And I have to select the location for bootloader. I have a few screenshots, can someone check if everything is correct?
[18:38] <snjdfj> daverGS: last time I checked, graphics switching is pretty broken in Linux, at least with the nvidia / intel hybrid setup in laptops. Can't comment on desktops
[18:38] <A1Recon> If someone wants to help me regarding my problem, do mention/ping me.
[18:38] <daverGS> snjdfj: I'm currently on a laptop and boy am I seeing some weird stuff :(
[18:38] <snjdfj> daverGS: I wish you mutch luck.
[18:39]  * snjdfj slowly backs away
[18:39] <ducasse> !pm | A1Recon
[18:39] <ubottu> A1Recon: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can help you, benefit from your questions and answers, and ensure that you're not getting bad advice.
[18:39] <daverGS> snjdfj: I don't blame you for hiding, I've spent 10+ hours trying to get this p and running
[18:39] <snjdfj> Realistically though in the future I suggest you avoid dual GPU laptop's for Linux. I'm assuming you can use bumblebee
[18:39] <ycyclist> So, I had two video cards, just one actually running X I thought, and everything was fine.  Then somebody needed the one I wasn't using, so I took it out, and now my mouse doesn't work in X.  It works in the bios menu, but when Ubuntu boots, the mouse arrow is not present.
[18:39] <tomreyn> A1Recon: i suggest that you discuss how you would like to do the partitionming now and that you just post the link to the screenshot.
[18:39] <snjdfj> daverGS: https://www.bumblebee-project.org/
[18:39] <snjdfj> I presume you're after this.
[18:39] <A1Recon> I have been using Ubuntu for 4 years now and yes Nvidia/Intel GPU switching is messed up.
[18:40] <tgm4883> daverGS: this is a new install?
[18:40] <snjdfj> daverGS: my best suggestion is to disable one of the two GPU's
[18:40] <ycyclist> So how do I get X to recognize my house?
[18:40] <snjdfj> :/
[18:40] <daverGS> Yeah fresh laptop, I'm using bumblebee to handle disabling of the nvidia GPU for the power benefits, and Prime for the actual GPU selection
[18:40]  * snjdfj hugs daverGS
[18:40] <pavlos> daverGS: this may help, read the comments ... http://tipsonubuntu.com/2016/08/24/nvidia-367-44-support-titan-x-pascal-gtx-1060/
[18:40] <daverGS> But the laptop only boots like 1/5 times, and only when Nvidia Persistence Daemon fails on startup
[18:40] <snjdfj> you're in for a world of pain, broken software, and nightmares.
[18:41] <daverGS> Not to mention the external monitor issues
[18:41] <snjdfj> daverGS: You can do what most do and just disable the nvidia GPU
[18:41] <tgm4883> daverGS: I wonder if it's worth trying 17.04, there were some improvments with hybrid graphics. I haven't really used it since 14.04 days but I had a AMD card anyway
[18:41] <snjdfj> You can usually do it in the BIOS / UEFI
[18:41] <daverGS> snjdfj: My only concern with that is whether external monitor support is in, I've heard there are problems with that
[18:42] <daverGS> Although that might only be in the dual GPU scenario
[18:42] <daverGS> if it thinks it's Intel-only, it might behave
[18:42] <snjdfj> daverGS: depends if you have a muxer internally
[18:42] <tomreyn> afaik all of what you just discussed works fine with the open source driver stack
[18:42] <daverGS> but I'd ideally like to have the 1060 for when I'm booting windows
[18:43] <snjdfj> daverGS: depending on wether or not you have a muxer your external monitor will be connected to one of the two GPU's
[18:43] <snjdfj> if you have a muxer you get into the fun world of who gets to control the port.
[18:43] <tgm4883> daverGS: can you still use vgaswitcheroo to disable the nvidia card in Linux?
[18:44] <daverGS> tgm4883: I haven't tried! so far I've only tried various Prime/bumblebee configs
[18:44] <snjdfj> I'm just going to be lazy and use PiVPN
[18:44] <tgm4883> daverGS: IIRC I believe I did that previously to conserve power. If you're just looking at using the intel card in linux might be worth looking at
[18:45] <snjdfj> daverGS: Nvidia support under linux can be very finicy
[18:45] <snjdfj> Intel iGPU support is amazing though
[18:45] <snjdfj> I also suggest you get powertop
[18:46] <daverGS> I think my ideal scenario is Intel-only in Linux, but full graphics switching still working in windows
[18:46] <snjdfj> that's possible
[18:46] <daverGS> I've been testing with powertop to check if the nvidia GPU is powered down in Intel mode
[18:46] <daverGS> I want to get the most out of this 94WHr battery
[18:46] <snjdfj> daverGS: https://askubuntu.com/questions/172609/how-to-disable-discrete-gpu-using-nvidia-drivers#184436
[18:47] <snjdfj> I can't really help you since my laptop is iGPU only, but hopefully that helps
[18:47] <daverGS> I'll take a look, thanks!
[18:47] <snjdfj> Your GPU will be disabled in Linux but when you boot Windows the Nvidia GPU will be online with the igPU
[18:47] <A1Recon> Just in case someone wants to look at the screenshots... Here they are http://imgur.com/a/8EzNO. Should there be something about the UEFI option? Where should i install the bootloader?
[18:47] <daverGS> as a fun fact, when I'm in Intel-only mode, lspci freezes my entire machine :/
[18:47] <ycyclist> Still trying to find something on my disappearing mouse.
[18:47] <A1Recon> Ping/Mention me, if anyone wants to help.
[18:48] <snjdfj> A1Recon: 1. Those aren't screenshots, 2. use gummiboot
[18:48] <ycyclist> Funny how searching for X windows these days yields you Windows.
[18:48] <daverGS> pretty sure that's just related to the total mess that is the switchable graphics setup
[18:48] <snjdfj> ycyclist: wayland is the future.
[18:49] <snjdfj> It's fun watching a Xeon churn out certs
[18:49] <b_p> does anybody know how linux kernel checks the address validity? I mean, how can a page-fault be differentiated from a seg-fault?
[18:49] <snjdfj> b_p: not Ubuntu related but
[18:49] <snjdfj> http://wiki.osdev.org/Page_fault
[18:50] <snjdfj> http://wiki.osdev.org/Calling_Global_Constructors
[18:50] <snjdfj> A PageFault IIRC is an actual interupt
[18:50] <b_p> thanks a lot snjdfj, can you suggest me a more appropriated channel?
[18:50] <snjdfj> SegFault is something handled by your compiler / C lib
[18:50] <snjdfj> b_p: #osdev, #linux
[18:51] <ducasse> A1Recon: if sda2 is your efi partition (looks like it), that is where the bootloader goes. do you get anything from 'ls /sys/firmware/efi' in a terminal?
[18:51] <tomreyn> A1Recon: from these screenshots its not clear what your goal is
[18:53] <daverGS> snjdfj: do you think that simply disabling nvidia in the grub cmdline would work?
[18:53] <daverGS> for disabling the nvidia gpu
[18:53] <A1Recon> tomreyn,  want to reinstall Ubuntu 16.04 on my PC which was dual-booted with Win10/Ubuntu16.04. UEFI is enabled. I am using a LiveUSB and I am currently in the menu where "i have to select the partition where Ubuntu has to be installed". And I have to select the location for bootloader. I have a few screenshots, can someone check if everything is correct?  < I posted this a few moments ago
[18:53] <b_p> thanks, i have thought that there was something like an hardware check even for the SegFault
[18:53] <snjdfj> daverGS: I couldn't tell you
[18:53] <nacc> b_p: no, you are confusing two 'fault' terms
[18:53] <ducasse> A1Recon: do you get anything from 'ls /sys/firmware/efi' in a terminal?
[18:53] <snjdfj> Last time I touched Nvidia and Linux it was a mess.

[19:13] <ducasse> eelstrebor: odd, that's all i had to do
[19:13] <ducasse> user605: why did you not create a partition?
[19:13] <Seveas> user605: how are you trying to look at the data?
[19:14] <pavlos> user605: the line under partition should be be /dev/sdb1
[19:14] <user605> ducasse, I am trying to recover after windows hammed up the disk.
[19:14] <user605> Seveas, just by navigating to it with file explorer.
[19:15] <Seveas> user605: ok, can you run these commands and pastebin the result: mount; sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb
[19:15] <user605> Seveas, I see that it is missing a mount point.
[19:16] <Seveas> user605: it might be. That screenshot doesn't say much, but those commands will give us information to dig furhter.
[19:16] <user605> Seveas, okay.  one second.
[19:17] <user605> Seveas, exactly as shown  "mount; sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb"  ?
[19:17] <Seveas> yeah

[19:19] <onomatopiea> How do you share a folder over the network with ubuntu. Should I be securing htat?
[19:20] <ducasse> onomatopiea: share to what kind of client?
[19:20] <onomatopiea> ducasse: It would be a windows one
[19:20] <onomatopiea> ducasse: It's a bit odd. There's an LDAP server all windows users authenticate against
[19:20] <user605> Seveas, My mistake.... :)    https://pastebin.com/d3ns5bGV
[19:20] <ducasse> onomatopiea: then samba, in which case please don't ask me :)
[19:21] <onomatopiea> But the linux machines have no central authentication. It's all just local users
[19:21] <sorinello> jushur, are you still around ? so resoling will work only if those clients use DHCP ? or if I set static addresses should be enough ?
[19:21] <onomatopiea> ducasse: Unauthenticatd samba though I imagine..
[19:21] <A1Recon> ducasse It didn't work. I am being taken to grub terminal when I chose "UEFI: Jetflash 16GB". A bit of a backstory > Last night i was running my ubuntu 16.04 and playing around with blueman and hciconfig to get a bluetooth speaker to work properly. Then suddenly POOF!. Abrupt shut down. I thought my system must have overheated but nope. It wasn't, it didn't feel hot enough near the fans. I powered on the Laptop again and what greeted me was the
[19:21] <A1Recon> grub terminal. So I thought I would reinstall Ubuntu anyway since I had been facing some odd small problems with it. I googled and came across this PPA named yannubuntu/boot-recovery which could fix the boot. It also could generate a Boot Info summary file which would help to see if there were any problems. So I generated the boot-recovery by logging in using a 16.04 LiveUSB created on etcher.io on the Win10. And tried installing Ubuntu over the
[19:21] <A1Recon> previous install on /dev/sda5/ and here we are.
[19:22] <Seveas> autra: according to that output, /dev/sdb is not mounted. sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt
[19:22] <Seveas> err.
[19:22] <Seveas> user605: according to that output, /dev/sdb is not mounted. sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt
[19:22] <jushur> sorinello: all computers/devices needs to use the same localdomain name, and the router need to be configured to handle that kind of resolving.
[19:22] <Seveas> then browse to /mnt in your file explorer thing
[19:23] <Seveas> user605: I'm guessing you browsed to /dev/sdb before. That's entirely pointless as you might have guessed by now :-)
[19:23] <blip-> hi, upon every login i get a a window saying an internal error has occurred.  Looking at details shows Xorg is supposedly crashing.  The only side-effect seems to be that my laptop's brightness control stops working directly after logging in
[19:23] <blip-> any thoughts?
[19:24] <A1Recon> ducasse so now my plan is to log into Win10 again.... check if the Ubuntu16.04 ISO was okay or not. Use Etcher or Rufus to recreate the LiveUSB and try again.
[19:24] <user605> Seveas, I can see the drive, it is mounted, but the data isn't there.
[19:24] <user605> Even though gparted states "used".
[19:24] <Seveas> user605: did you run the mount command?
[19:24] <ducasse> A1Recon: try that. when booting from the usb there should also be a 'check medium for errors option'
[19:25] <user605> Seveas, yes.... nothing has changed.  Can still see the drive, nothing on it.
[19:25] <Seveas> user605: ok, time for the next commands: mount; sudo ls -la /mnt
[19:26] <A1Recon> ducasse will you be here for the next 2-3 hours?
[19:26] <user605> Seveas, OH!  wait.   from commandline I went to /mnt did a ls.... I see a lost+found folder!
[19:27] <user605> bash: cd: lost+found/: Permission denied
[19:27] <ducasse> A1Recon: actually, i'm just about to log off. nearly bedtime here. i'm sure someone can help you, though.
[19:27] <A1Recon> okay then...
[19:27] <A1Recon> thanks
[19:27] <A1Recon> its 1Am here anyway
[19:27] <Seveas> user605: if all you see is a lost+found, then there is no data on the disk.
[19:28] <Seveas> user605: last resort: sudo find /mnt/lost+found
[19:28] <Seveas> if that has any files, your disk was corrupt and fsck managed to rescue the contents of some files. If that finds nothing, the disk is empty.
[19:29] <user605> Seveas, I can see my files in there tho....  sudo ls lost+found/#44040193
[19:29] <user605> There are 4 # dirs.
[19:29] <Seveas> ok, then fsck did rescue some things...
[19:29] <Seveas> now it's up to you to find out what's what :)
[19:30] <blip-> how can I restore X11/Xorg packages and settings to install-state ?
[19:30] <user605> Seveas, can I just copy those folder over to the mounted drive?
[19:31] <Seveas> user605: they're on the mounted drive
[19:31] <user605> Seveas, okay... mv them?
[19:31] <daverGS> snjdfj: just noticed that the hosted files for the 'disable discrete gpu' are gone :(
[19:31] <kunji> blip-: Theoretically by purging and the reinstalling them, though I wouldn't like having to do that on my system.
[19:31] <kunji> *then
[19:33] <ycyclist> Anyway, my Ubuntu which was working, now doesn't have a mouse in X.  Is there a way to reconfigure X to get it back?
[19:33] <blip-> kunji, does apt-get install --reinstall suffice?  or remove --purge needed then install
[19:33] <ycyclist> I had an extra video card in the beast, and when I pulled it out for someone else to use, the house stopped appearing in the desktop.
[19:33] <Seveas> user605: sudo mv /mnt/lost+found/* /mnt
[19:34] <ycyclist> When I boot to bios, the mouse appears there, but not in the Ubuntu desktop.
[19:34] <Seveas> user605: and for easier looking at them, sudo chown them to your login
[19:34] <ycyclist> And of course I cannot get to system settings to fix it.
[19:34] <ducasse> blip-: you'd need the purge
[19:34] <blip-> thanks
[19:35] <user605> Seveas, mv: cannot stat '/mnt/lost+found/*': No such file or directory
[19:35] <kunji> blip-: I think reinstall would leave configuration files?  But I'm not certain of that.  I'm also not sure if the ones when installing necessarily match those of a default install.
[19:35] <blip-> im gonna do that to all *xorg* packages i see in installed
[19:35] <Seveas> user605: ah yeah, because you can't access it. sudo -i to get a root shell and then just mv instead of sudo mv :)
[19:35] <blip-> i can't even find /etc/X11/xorg.conf... i gues things have changed a lot over the years lol
[19:35] <kunji> blip-: Why do you need to do this?
[19:35] <ducasse> ycyclist: 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg'? guessing here.
[19:36] <ycyclist> Ok.  Thanks...trying in a second
[19:36] <kunji> ducasse: Maybe would also be better for blip-'s case?
[19:36] <blip-> kunji, upon login Ubuntu shows an error window saying Xorg crashed (even though everything looks fine).  After that brightness control stops working.  problem just started yesterday
[19:36] <ducasse> blip-: xorg.conf is not there by default, x does auto-configure now.
[19:36] <ycyclist> xorg is not installed.
[19:37] <ducasse> kunji: i doubt it would reconfigure everythhing that is relevant, but worth a shot.
[19:37] <kunji> blip-: Update recently?  Maybe you can find just which package is causing this
[19:37] <user605> Seveas, GOT THEM!  Thank you, appreciate your time.   Going to play around.... may be back if I blow it up.  lol
[19:38] <ducasse> ycyclist: try with xserver-xorg instead
[19:38] <sorinello> jushur, go it to work, but when I ping, it resolves only after 10 seconds, and the results don't seem to be cached
[19:38] <ycyclist> Ok
[19:38] <kunji> blip-: Maybe check the contents of /var/log/apt/history.log
[19:39] <user605> Seveas, can that lost+found dir be deleted now?
[19:39] <ycyclist> I got this:  /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: xserver-xorg is not installed
[19:40] <scorpion> hey guys i tried to install kde plasma on ubuntu 14.04 by running sudo apt-get install kde-standard
[19:40] <PleaseHelpMe> it seems Ubuntu's ability to move around thousands of files is much less than windows. Several times "files" has crashed on me and the operation wsa cancelled halfway through.
[19:40] <scorpion> and when i reboot into kde i get only a background with my shortcuts and no KDE
[19:40] <Seveas> user605: no, you'll want to keep it. It's where fsck will put files that are recovered
[19:40] <chris9> hey there, anyone know anything about installing printer drivers for a bizhub c3350?
=== Carl_Sagan_ is now known as JeSus_
[19:40] <PleaseHelpMe> I have a older with 10,000 images. Is there something I'm missing in trying to cut and paste the first 2,500 out? Ubuntu doesn't seem to like that, while windows would manage it after a loading bar filled
[19:40] <PleaseHelpMe> folder*
[19:40] <scorpion> any ideas what went wrong for me??
[19:40] <Seveas> chris9: is that one of those canon monstrosities?
[19:41] <slashdotever> hi iam frustrated about not beeing able to install libboost1.5-dev how is this possible. tried every option i googled
[19:41] <chris9> Seveas: yeah. printer scanner copier stapler
[19:41] <Seveas> chris9: ah no, konica minolta. Sorry, never used those.
[19:41] <slashdotever> iam trying to install alien which depends on libboost
[19:42] <chris9> seveas: well, I'm having a driver issue, maybe you could help?
[19:42] <slashdotever> i have been away from linux for some years but didnt expect this difficulty on installing a package
[19:42] <scorpion> how do I properly add kde plasma to ubuntu 14.04
[19:42] <Seveas> slashdotever: ubuntu has a newer libboost than that
[19:42] <ducasse> scorpion: plasma was not available for 14.04 iirc, did you add a ppa?
[19:43] <chris9> basically, I install the drivers, and it tells me a filter is missing. no other info
[19:43] <blip-> kunji, ducasse:  being the idiot I am, while trying to purge xserver/xorg packages - it needed to remove xubuntu-core and xubuntu-desktop.  I removed those manually (non-purge).  Now I can't reinsall them, broken packages :/
[19:43] <scorpion> no i ran sudo apt-get install kde-standard
[19:43] <scorpion> after running sudo apt-cache search plasma
[19:44] <slashdotever> iam trying sudo apt-get -f install yum-utils alien
[19:44] <ycyclist> Okay, I installed that, ,then did the command and my mouse is now back.  Thank you.
[19:45] <slashdotever> https://thepasteb.in/p/nZhlv8pKWzpfY
[19:45] <slashdotever> this where problem starts
[19:45] <Seveas> slashdotever: which ubuntu version, and which ppa's did you add?
[19:46] <Seveas> this looks a bit on the old side
[19:46] <slashdotever> ubuntu@ubuntu-VirtualBox:~$ cat /etc/issue
[19:46] <slashdotever> Ubuntu 15.04 \n \l
[19:46] <ducasse> slashdotever: that's eol
[19:46] <Seveas> yeah, that ain't supported.
[19:46] <slashdotever> how can i upgrade it?
[19:47] <Seveas> reinstall will be quicker. but you can try sudo do-release-upgrade a few times for 4 upgrades :)
[19:47] <scorpion> well somehow, i ran apt-get purge kde-standard, rebooted, kde plasma booted up, i logged in and the plasma desktop appeared >>>>> WTF
[19:47] <blip-> kunji, ducasse :  nvm, got things fixed. rebooting
[19:47] <kunji> blip-: That's what I was afraid of.... T.T
[19:47] <ducasse> slashdotever: you'd need to upgrade at least twice, just reinstall if you can
[19:47] <slashdotever> ok thanks
[19:48] <kunji> blip-: Ah, I didn't keep up with the chat, that's good news
[19:48] <daverGS> does anyone know how I can tell Ubuntu to use my iGPU for the HDMI port?
[19:49] <jushur> sorinello: https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp u read that?
[19:49] <kunji> daverGS: I don't, but specifying the gpu and possibly cpu/computer model may help someone else give a good answer.
[19:50] <daverGS> It's a Gigabyte Aero 14wv7, which has a GTX 1060 and an i-7700HQ
[19:50] <sorinello> jushur, yes, I was reading that page
[19:51] <kunji> daverGS: Maybe it needs Bumblebee or whatever it is called for that?
[19:52] <nigletos> yo
[19:52] <scorpion> i spent 20 bucks on a motherboard, 20 bucks on an ssd, 25 bucks on a radeon HD 7570 and 15 bucks on a q9450 and installed ubuntu and i'm pulling 120 fps on left 4 dead 2
[19:52] <scorpion> sweetness :]
[19:52] <kunji> daverGS: https://bumblebee-project.org/
[19:53] <daverGS> kunji: ideal case is using iGPU only, I want the nvidia gpu disabled when in linux
[19:53] <scorpion> why?
[19:53] <scorpion> o.0
[19:53] <nigletos> how everyone doing
[19:53] <kunji> daverGS: But be aware that getting that working is not a topic I know anything about, so I won't be help if things break.  As far as I'm aware Bumblebee should allow for that.
[19:53] <ycyclist> Say anybody know what's going on here:??Temporary failure resolving 'archive.ubuntu.com'
[19:54] <daverGS> what's in your /etc/resolv.conf
[19:54] <scorpion> hmm actually its more like 150 fps... this ain't bad at all lol
[19:54] <ycyclist> My network connections appear to be alright.
[19:55] <ycyclist> The browser can get anything anywhere.
[19:55] <ycyclist> I just in fact went to archive.ubuntu.com from my browser.
[19:57] <Seveas> ycyclist: so try another apt-get update :)
[19:57] <ycyclist> Looks like there is an infinite loop in the apache directory that gives archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu/ubuntu/ubuntu...
[19:58] <ycyclist> That from my browser.
[19:58] <kunji> daverGS: Installation for Ubuntu here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee#Installation  But maybe you don't even need Bumblebee, when talking about power they mention some modules, reading on: https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Power-Management  So maybe you can use this vga_switcheroo directly or this bbswitch module.
[19:59] <User602> Seveas, So both drives are identical hardware. One is NTFS and the other is ext4.  I noticed the size differs 978G to 917G, is at attributed to the file system type?
[19:59] <kunji> daverGS: Ah, here we go: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics
[19:59] <ChaiTRex> ycyclist: That's because Ubuntu is recursive.
[19:59] <Seveas> ycyclist: that doesn't cause dns problems though.
[19:59] <Seveas> User602: depends on where you look at the size, but yes, that may very well be.
[20:00] <kunji> daverGS: Open source drivers only for that one though
[20:00] <Seveas> User602: though I do find a 60gb difference somewhat excessive. How do you look at the size?
[20:00] <User602> Seveas, just doing as df -h.   In gparted they seem off too though with diff numbers.
[20:01] <scorpion> is there a reason why i can't sudo apt-get install inix    on kubuntu 14.04?
[20:01] <ycyclist> Seveas:  Perhaps so, but it is looking for something that is not visible from the browser.  After apt-get update I get the same error.
[20:01] <nacc> !info inix trusty | scorpion
[20:02] <ubottu> scorpion: Package inix does not exist in trusty
[20:02] <nacc> scorpion: no such package in ubuntu at all
[20:02] <kunji> scorpion: What is inix even.....?
[20:02] <User602> Seveas, 978.09GB to 931.51GB in gparted.
[20:03] <pavlos> ycyclist: can you add nameserver 8.8.8.8 to your resolv.conf and try again?
[20:04] <akik> User602: i think that different comes from the default 5% allocation for root user. you can find the value with tune2fs
[20:04] <ycyclist> Did it.  Same problem.
[20:05] <User602> akik, even though these are just secondary data drives, not containing os?
[20:05] <akik> User602: sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sdXn | grep "Reserved block count"
[20:05] <akik> User602: yes it's for ext4 like that
[20:06] <akik> User602: you can change it to 0% if you want
[20:07] <ycyclist> The internet says akik is not an abbreviation, but another spelling for quartz.
[20:07] <User602> akik, what is the benefits of leaving as is?
[20:07] <akik> User602: well, only root can write to the disk when you reach the limit
[20:08] <akik> User602: you can change it to 0 with "sudo tune2fs -m 0 /dev/sdXn"
[20:09] <pavlos> ycyclist: is your ip static or dhcp?
[20:09] <User602> akik, I'll leave it.  Thank you.
[20:09] <ycyclist> dhcp inside a large and security sensitive organization which tortures people to death for mentioning their name.
[20:10] <User602> akik, FYI...  sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sdc | grep "Reserved block count just returned ">"
[20:10] <ycyclist> That being said, the end of the resolv.conf is a search on their dns.
[20:11] <pavlos> ycyclist: move the 8.8.8.8 at the top of the file and test with, ping -c2 8.8.8.8
[20:11] <akik> User602: you need to add " to the end
