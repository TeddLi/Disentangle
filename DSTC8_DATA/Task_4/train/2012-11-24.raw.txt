[15:22] <bazhang> Xylon, all on ONE line
[15:22] <Mukhthar> Funkt : back up your database by phpadmin
[15:22] <Seveas> Funkt, you shouldn't use xampp on ubuntu... regular mysql puts its databases in /var/lib/mysql, back up thata directory
[15:23] <arabi> escott how can i kill the process
[15:23] <Xylon> In short, im dual booting ubuntu with windows. Im using a usb pen drive, i pick the option to install it over my windows. It reboots but wont boot now
[15:23] <Xylon> black screen
[15:23] <Xylon> so thoughts?
[15:23] <escott> arabi, kill 3615
[15:23] <bazhang> Xylon, within windows is a WUBI install
[15:23] <Xylon> WUBI is?
[15:23] <Funkt> thank you im using lampp, and i cant see /var/lib/mysql
[15:23] <conall> does anyone know what is the maximum ram ubuntu 12.10 allows?
[15:23] <Funkt> any ideas?
[15:24] <bazhang> installed from within windows Xylon
[15:24] <arabi> kill 3615
[15:24] <arabi> bash: kill: (3615) - No such process
[15:24] <arabi> here is the response

[15:24] <Xylon> okay
[15:24] <Laban> MonkeyDust: But isn't it a client thing? I can't control the DNS server.
[15:24] <Xylon> meaning i gotta run it from within windows?
[15:24] <arabi> now is is gone without lilling i think
[15:24] <bazhang> Xylon, that is not a dual boot
[15:24] <arabi> lemme check
[15:25] <Laban> (dns is built into home-router)
[15:25] <Xylon> exactly
[15:25] <Xylon> so could you be precise?
[15:25] <Xylon> on what i should be doing right now?
[15:26] <bazhang> Xylon, using the enter key less
[15:26] <arabi> now it is working guys thanks escott, bye

[15:29] <bonez2046> Is it possible to manually remove a stanza from /var/lib/dpkg/available  pointing to a package that is neither installed nor wanted later?
[15:29] <TheMadDrizzle> Unfortunately, No.  But i'm willing to learn
[15:29] <bonez2046> or would that be dangerous to remove ?

[15:32] <LucidLuna> @xylon you could try running a live cd and installing grub to /dev/sda (or whatever your primary hd is)
[15:32] <Xylon> lucidluna, i dont really think so, i thought that was part of the installation

[16:41] <ActionParsnip> g00053: particularly handy on SSDs ;)
[16:42] <g00053> :D
[16:42] <ActionParsnip> g00053: its probably possible in some way with Firefox, but I haven't used it in a long while, I'm sure the procedure is similar (If you don't use it either then you don't have to worry)
[16:43] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, hang on, been a while since i messed with it
[16:43] <Hans_Zero> dcherniv_ it's a first time for me ^^ thank you in advance
[16:43] <g00053_> whoops
[16:43] <g00053_> ActionParsnip, nah i don't use firefox
[16:44] <dr_willis> ActionParsnip:  i think theres a typo in your commands you gave..  you got /run/google-chrome  then /run/chromium ;)
[16:44] <ActionParsnip> do'h
[16:44] <ActionParsnip> g00053_: ^
[16:44] <g00053_> got it
[16:44] <ActionParsnip> g00053_: you get the idea
[16:44] <ActionParsnip> dr_willis: thanks man :)
[16:45] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, aw man i disabled it in my kernel here, but if you have /dev/fb then you can use fbset to set the resolution and such
[16:45] <Hans_Zero> I don't think I have /dev/fb
[16:46] <dr_willis> ActionParsnip:  does chromoim and google-chrome share the same cache?
[16:46] <Anubis> hi there
[16:47] <ActionParsnip> dr_willis:  Look in ~/.cache  and see if the folder is the same.
[16:47] <ActionParsnip> dr_willis: not 100% sure tbh
[16:47] <Hans_Zero> note: it's still the same error (monitor saying "out of range") when I switch with ctr+alt+f1 to the cmd
[16:47] <Anubis> i'm trying to configure chromium to use a polipo but for some reason it doesnt work
[16:47] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, usually has a number after it like /dev/fb0
[16:47] <g00053_> dr_willis, i don't believe it does
[16:47] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, wow really
[16:47] <sevenforall> I have a dualscreen set-up, and the workspace preview (when I ctrl + arrow) used to take that into account. However, now it just shows a 16:9 ratio for each workspace, while it should be 32:9. Any idea how to fix that?
[16:47] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, hm then framebuffer not gonna help
[16:48] <dr_willis> i dont see any chromium named dir. :) but i did get an error when i ran chromoim due to  not setting up all your commands first
[16:48] <Hans_Zero> if I /dev/f tab->tab it only get's me /dev/fd/0
[16:48] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, probably something with this newfangled KMS thingy
[16:49] <Hans_Zero> dcherniv_ yes the xrandr stuff di work for the graphical environment but not the nongraphical one and I need a cmd to install graphics drivers so the xbmcbuntu does display anything at all apart from a notice that tells me to install some opengl drivers
[16:49] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, kernel basically initializes your graphics card without help of the X server
[16:49] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, i dont know where the resolution for that is set
[16:49] <Hans_Zero> ok
[16:49] <Hans_Zero> thanks so far
[16:49] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, you can try to boot with grub option nomodeset
[16:50] <Hans_Zero> yeah or maybe I'll start into runlevel 3...
[16:50] <Hans_Zero> thank you dcherniv_
[16:50] <dr_willis> ubuntu dosent really use runlevels
[16:50] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, or that boot into recovery mode and install graphics drivers
[16:50] <dr_willis> !text
[16:50] <ubottu> To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[16:50] <Hans_Zero> dr_willis does --single still work though?
[16:50] <Hans_Zero> thanks ubottu
[16:50] <dr_willis> Hans_Zero:  i always use the text mode option, i think 'single' does work.
[16:51] <Hans_Zero> ok text is fine with me though
[16:52] <Hans_Zero> lol it can't display grub
[16:53] <Hans_Zero> I think I'll ask if someones got a usefull pciex graphics card and then try again with this pc... it's no help without one I think
[16:54] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: what video chip do you use?
[16:54] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, adjust GFX_MODE in /etc/default/grub and update-grub2
[16:54] <dr_willis> theres some options in /etc/default/grub to tell grub to ise a old fashioned text based menu
[16:55] <dcherniv_> Hans_Zero, or uncomment this line GRUB_TERMINAL=console
[16:57] <Hans_Zero> ok I'll try that

[17:01] <Hans_Zero> ActionParsnip that is a usefull advice :)
[17:01] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: it doesn't display by default, doesn't mean it CAN'T be made to show
[17:02] <Evil_Eric> quiet=splash
[17:02] <ActionParsnip> Evil_Eric: ask here, the channel will reply
=== ok is now known as Guest94614
[17:03] <Hans_Zero> ActionParsnip dosn't work monitor still says "out of range"
[17:03] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: does the system have a make and model?
[17:03] <Hans_Zero> yes it does
[17:03] <Evil_Eric> well i have an issue with shutting down when i try to shut down using the GUI it shuts down to a certian point then freezes and dosent power down
[17:04] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: what is it please, that'd be more useful than simply saying 'yes it does'
[17:04] <Hans_Zero> Aspire E380... note the modell comes with a pciex graphics card which is not working anymore so I'm using the onboard graphics atm
[17:04] <Hans_Zero> needed to look it up first
[17:04] <Hans_Zero> (brand is asus)
[17:05] <yeats> Evil_Eric: I've seen that - selecting "shut down" again usually does it.  Annoying but not anything I've followed up on :-/
[17:05] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/desktop/0000/Acer/AspireE380/AspireE380sp2.shtml    couldnt use that to find the spec...so when people ask details, you could tell them?
[17:05] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: seems to be an nvidia onboard video chip
[17:05] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: add the boot option:    nouveau.blacklist=1
[17:06] <Hans_Zero> yes seems to be
[17:06] <Hans_Zero> again I can't add boot parameters as long as I can't see a grub
[17:06] <Evil_Eric> yeats , i cant select shutdown a 2nd time cause it shuts down at a point where the gui isnt present
[17:06] <genericus> Evil_Eric have you tried shutting down using the console?
[17:06] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: why couldn't you find that link online to get the video chip as you had a model name, rather than saying you didn't know the video chip. You had all the info necessary to find it online.....
[17:07] <rex> evil_eric -> try from comman line sudo poweroff
[17:08] <Evil_Eric> you mean sudo shutdown -P now
[17:08] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: is the onboard video set to the primary video chip?
[17:08] <pablord> Hey, I have a question: I know the sufix in the files in /etc/apt.conf.d is to make apt read them in order, but, can I put the same as other file does have? How do I choose a number?
[17:08] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: in the BIOS?
[17:08] <Hans_Zero> ActionParsnip yes it is
[17:08] <Hans_Zero> and there is no other video chip
[17:08] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: so, why could you not find the inormation I found? Genuine question?
[17:08] <rex> yes
[17:08] <usr13> jaylkay: More-than-likely is the best answer we can give, (unless someone watching right now is actually running the TG-3468 (v1 or v2).
[17:09] <Hans_Zero> I could've found it I didn't (yet) search for it
[17:09] <jaylkay> okay
[17:09] <Hans_Zero> I'm having trouble with showing up grub not the graphics driver
[17:09] <Evil_Eric> rex the point of this is to shut down through the gui not by command line anyhow
[17:10] <Evil_Eric> hi there linuxguy
[17:10] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: are you trying to install the OS or is this on an installed OS?
[17:10] <Evil_Eric> funny seeing you here
[17:10] <Hans_Zero> ActionParsnip this is an installed os (xbmcbuntu which is basically xubunut as far as I know)
[17:11] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: can you boot to the install CD ok?
[17:11] <dr_willis> xbmcbuntu had issues last i tried it.. its very easy to install xbmc on a real ubuntu install.
[17:11] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: if you let the OS boot for 10 mins, then press CTRL+ALT+F1   do you get a prompt?
[17:11] <qwd> Ubuntu 12.04 AMD64. I'm not getting any sound. Rebooting doesn't work and afaik I haven't done any changes. Would appreciate help troubleshooting.
[17:11] <rex> evil_eric. -> what itr shows during shutdown?
[17:11] <Hans_Zero> ActionParsnip yes I can and yes I installed it from the livecd
[17:11] <dr_willis> Hans_Zero:  check out openelec if you want a MultiMedia distro  its basically a mini xmbmcubuntu type setup
[17:12] <Hans_Zero> actionParsnip no I don't get a prompt the monitor says out of range... the graphics card drivers work fine the resolution is not supported by the monitor
[17:12] <usr13> jaylkay: It's the same (and sometimes worse) trying to buy hardwre for a Win7 64bit box.  I know.  I had to get a WiFi card for one at the VFW post and I found 2 that didn't work.  There were 32bit drivers but not 64bit.  You could install the card, install drivers (wouldn't even designate whether it was 32 or 64bit, and you could install a driver that turns out it was 32bit and just didn't work).
[17:12] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: ahh so you can then log in there. Then run:  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[17:12] <Hans_Zero> ok I got grub :)
[17:12] <Evil_Eric> it dosent show any errors just your normal stuff and i cant screen shot it due to it being shut down and if its logged somewhere i dont know where so please point me in the direction to get the logs and ill get them up on pastebin for you
[17:13] <ActionParsnip> qwd: what is the output of:   wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh --upload
[17:13] <dr_willis> Hans_Zero:  grub  can be set to use differnt modes.. some monitors just dont like some of the res/modes that grub can use.
[17:13] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: add the boot option:   nouveau.blacklist=1
[17:13] <Hans_Zero> I set grub to console and now it shows
[17:13] <usr13> jaylkay: But I think your chances are very good - that one will be ok.
[17:13] <Hans_Zero> ok now I can hopefully start linux in text mode
[17:14] <qwd> ActionParsnip: http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=24cc3bf8ca311f89d09b1063fc6550bbb63c35e1
[17:14] <jaylkay> alright
[17:14] <jaylkay> I'll se
[17:14] <jaylkay> e
[17:14] <rex> /var/log/syslog.0
[17:14] <Hans_Zero> which line do I add this again? the one with linux or the one with initrd ?
[17:14] <andybrine> anyone here know how to install gnome3 remix on ubuntu 12.10?
[17:15] <usr13> !text | Hans_Zero
[17:15] <ubottu> Hans_Zero: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[17:15] <rex> gedit /var/log/kern.log
[17:15] <Hans_Zero> usr13 append in a new line or append to the last line?
[17:15] <Evil_Eric> thanks rex gimme a min to post it
[17:15] <usr13> Hans_Zero: At the last of the kernel line.  Space and then   text
[17:15] <ActionParsnip> qwd: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1383051/
[17:16] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: get fully updated and install the nvidia-current package
[17:16] <Hans_Zero> nvm usr13 got it
[17:16] <Hans_Zero> thank you
[17:17] <Hans_Zero> ok cmd is now working... now I can update graphics drivers @ActionParsnip
[17:17] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[17:18] <qwd> ActionParsnip: Thanks!
[17:18] <Hans_Zero> now I can check what kinda grapghics chip I got (nvidia...) and then install apropriate drivers...
[17:18] <ActionParsnip> qwd: all ok?
[17:18] <genericus> andybrine if you just want Gnome 3 then "sudo apt-get install gnome"
[17:18] <ActionParsnip> genericus: Gnome3 is already installed
[17:19] <genericus> ActionParsnip Including Shell? I don't keep up with Ubuntu much
[17:19] <Hans_Zero> ok ActionParsnip system is up to date and nvidia-current is also up to date
[17:19] <ActionParsnip> andybrine: install gnome-panel   log off then log in to the new session
[17:19] <dr_willis> Hans_Zero:  lspci should show.   lspci | grep VGA (or grep vga)
[17:19] <ActionParsnip> genericus: gnome-shell is in the official repos too
[17:19] <qwd> ActionParsnip: Yeah, I didn't even have to reboot. I've had this problem for days so thanks a lot!
[17:19] <andybrine> thanks guys, I have installed gnome sheel
[17:19] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: try:   sudo nvidia-xconfig    then reboot
[17:20] <andybrine> its weird that I cant apply any themes
[17:20] <Hans_Zero> dr_willis it shows the graphics card correctly
[17:20] <ActionParsnip> qwd: your sound may have needed the later alsa, or resetting the sound config by deleting the pulse file and folder
[17:20] <andybrine> have you come across this at all?
[17:20] <ActionParsnip> andybrine: how is that weird...not knowing how to do something isn't "weird"
[17:21] <andybrine> you assume that i have never done it before
[17:21] <andybrine> lol
[17:21] <andybrine> i have downloaded and applied themes which have worked perfectly
[17:21] <ActionParsnip> andybrine: what shell / desktop are you using?
[17:22] <dr_willis> Hans_Zero:  id hope lspci shows the card correctly. ;) the issue is if the drivers work correctly with the card..
[17:22] <Hans_Zero> ok ActionParsnip I got sudo nvidia-xconfig and rebooted still no opengl support
[17:22] <andybrine> I am using the latest shell and ubuntu 12.10
[17:22] <Hans_Zero> dr_willis it shows the graphics card correctly
[17:22] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: but do you get a desktop?
[17:22] <ActionParsnip> andybrine: are you using Unity shell?
[17:23] <Hans_Zero> ActionParsnip I got a desktop before... it consists of a message box telling me that it needs opengl (which is the xbmc frontend)
[17:23] <andybrine> im currently running gnome3
[17:23] <Evil_Eric> hey REX you still around
[17:23] <ActionParsnip> andybrine: that doesn't tell us the shell
[17:23] <rex> yeah
[17:23] <Evil_Eric> can i pm you
[17:23] <ActionParsnip> andybrine: Unity is a shell for Gnome3, so when you use Unity, you are using Gnome3
[17:24] <ActionParsnip> andybrine: Gnome3 has been the default desktop since Oneiric

=== Guest94614 is now known as ok_wait
[17:24] <Hans_Zero> OK I'm happy so far my linux is now working appropriately...  now I need opengl support for my nforce430 chipset graphics
[17:25] <dr_willis> Hans_Zero:  if you are using xbmcbuntu  i would suggest trying an actual ubuntu install and installing xbmc. it may work better
[17:25] <ActionParsnip> andybrine: lets make it easy, does your desktop look like this: http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Unity_5.12_on_Ubuntu_12.04.jpg
[17:25] <Hans_Zero> yes I thought about that dr_willis
[17:25] <dr_willis> Hans_Zero:  technically this channel does NOT support xbmcbuntu ;)  and last i used xbmcvbuntu - it was not as up to date as ubuntu in some areas
[17:25] <andybrine> I am using gnome shell on the latest version of ubuntu
[17:26] <ActionParsnip> andybrine: ok Gnome shell is the shell then
[17:26] <andybrine> lol, yes :s exactly what i said originally
[17:26] <andybrine> lpl
[17:27] <Hans_Zero> dr_willis true but I'm not having trouble with the xbmc part but the underlying stuff like grub and everything and you all helped well and I got the ubuntu part running now I'm looking for graphics driers which again I think is part of ubuntu...
[17:27] <rex> evil_eric check this --- > http://askubuntu.com/questions/103015/how-do-i-check-if-last-shutdown-was-clean
[17:27] <Evil_Eric> thanks rex im on it
[17:27] <Hans_Zero> dr_willis I could of course switch to nvidia support now
=== g_byers[Away] is now known as g_byers
[17:27] <dr_willis> Hans_Zero:  if  You really need a live xbmc setup try openelec --> http://openelec.tv/
[17:27] <dr_willis> its updated more often.
[17:28] <ActionParsnip> andybrine: http://www.noobslab.com/2011/11/themes-collection-for-ubuntu-1110-unity.html      http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/07/a-list-of-best-15-ubuntu-1204-themes.html
[17:29] <dr_willis> I wonder when someone will shoehorn that netflix on ubuntu thang into xbmc on ubuntu. ;) that would be handy
[17:29] <Hans_Zero> dr_willis I worked with openelec on a rapsberry pi and was disappointed with the lack of some stuff and thought maybe xbmcbuntu was better
[17:29] <dr_willis> Hans_Zero:  given the specs of the Pi. ;) that fact it worked decently well is amazeing.. but my Pis are on backorder.
[17:30] <sergio> Hi, I upgraded ubuntu to the newest release, but now, I only see my desktop, the panel on the left no longer appears.
[17:30] <rex> evil_eric ----> i think its a bug because on my lappy i am unable to use restart feature. It simply go blank and i have to press poweroff button for sometime to shutdown
[17:30] <dr_willis> well its nap time for me.. bbl
[17:30] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: I'd install lxde so you can at least use a desktop to setup the OS then switch to the XBMC nonsense.
[17:30] <rex> restart feature is now working in 12.10 in my netbook
[17:30] <Evil_Eric> hahaha im able to restart but not use the shutdown feature
[17:30] <Hans_Zero> dr_willis I think the new version with even more ram should work even better
[17:31] <rex> what version you use?
[17:31] <Evil_Eric> 12.04
[17:31] <ChrisWere> Hey guys, could you help me with my wireless Internet connection. It's so much slower on Ubuntu than it is on Windows.
[17:31] <Evil_Eric> rex does that lappy use intel drivers?
[17:31] <Hans_Zero> ActionParsnip good Idea but I kinda wanted to use xfce...
[17:32] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: that is fine too
[17:32] <Hans_Zero> since this is already a xubuntu
[17:32] <rex> yes jus graphic
[17:32] <badboy4life> hello
[17:32] <Evil_Eric> thats the issue then
[17:32] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: you may need to add stuff to xorg.conf to make the driver load properly
[17:32] <rex> in 12.04 i have restart problem but not in 12.10 try this version
[17:33] <Evil_Eric> cause when im on my ati i dont have the issue but the 2nd reboot from the intel side it dose this everytimr
=== Gallomimia_ is now known as Gallomimia
[17:33] <Hans_Zero> ActionParsnip is there no magical Ubuntu script that installs proprietary nvidia drivers and does everything I need to do auto-magically?
[17:33] <badboy4life> I'm sorry I am new to ubuntu, but I need urgent answer about transferring files from my pc to iphone :)
[17:33] <ChrisWere> Anyone about to help me with my wireless problem? It's pretty speedy in Windows but not in Xubuntu 12.04
[17:33] <rex> means not supporting intel
[17:33] <rex> fully
[17:33] <Hans_Zero> I thought that was one of the 3 killer features of ubuntu
[17:33] <Evil_Eric> yeah
[17:34] <Evil_Eric> same bug for both of us
[17:34] <hs366> hi
[17:34] <ChrisWere> Hans_Zero: Arn't you using gtk-jockey?
[17:34] <rex> then we have to wait and hope next kernel will solve the problem
[17:34] <Hans_Zero> ChrisWere I don't even know what that is
[17:34] <kamidi> Hand_Zero: Software Sources -> Additional Drivers
[17:35] <Evil_Eric> yep and in this case it will break my graphics and ill have to do a fresh install and upgrade to get it right
[17:35] <Hans_Zero> kamidi can you talk me through the cmd version ?
[17:35] <rex> yeah
[17:35] <Evil_Eric> switchable graphics ='s fail on linux
[17:35] <kamidi> Hans_Zero: I have ATI/AMD and i don't know specifics of nVidia driver installation
[17:36] <Hans_Zero> thanks kamidi
[17:36] <Evil_Eric> i have amd/intel
[17:36] <ChrisWere> Hans_Zero: the "Additional Drievrs" program should help you with nVidia drivers. Have you seen that program?
[17:36] <kamidi> Evil_Eric: Even if graphics fail, you don't have to do fresh install in most cases
[17:37] <delac> any way to get e160e working on 12.04?
[17:37] <Hans_Zero> ChrisWere is there a cmd line version of it? I have to set up a graphical environment before I do stuff like that first
[17:37] <Evil_Eric> i know its just easyer to do a fresh install in order to get it working better
[17:37] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: yes, the nvidia-current installs it all but if your screen is cheap it will not report EDID and you will need to set this up yourself
[17:37] <Hans_Zero> thanks ActionParsnip
[17:37] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: I need one as the defalts detected by my screen are whack so I override with the xorg.conf file
[17:37] <kamidi> Evil_Eric: i had problems too with automatic installation (Software sources). i had to use terminal to install some dependencies and after that reinstall fglrx. everything worked fine after that
[17:37] <Hans_Zero> so I already got the correct drivers and only need to modify the xorg stuff myself?
[17:37] <rex> yeah fresh install resolve most of the issue
[17:37] <hs366> can i save my irc password on xchat (ubuntu)
=== tMobile4a03 is now known as tyteen4a03
[17:37] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: I can pastebin my fileif you want
[17:38] <ChrisWere> Hans_Zero: try install nvidia-current from the command line. Although you won't see the effects of it untill your in an x environment.
[17:38] <Hans_Zero> thatl'd be nice thank you
[17:38] <Hans_Zero> ChrisWere I got that allready
[17:38] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1383104
[17:38] <kamidi> rex: in my case, problem wouldn't have gone away even with fresh install
[17:39] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: you will need to run:    gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf     to get write access
[17:39] <ChrisWere> Is anyone about to help with my wifi problem? It seems a lot slower on Ubutnu but not in Windows
[17:39] <kamidi> ChrisWere: what wifi you have?
[17:39] <Hans_Zero> thanks ActionParsnip... I at least knew this much from my 3 years linuxing
[17:40] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: I cover the bases
[17:40] <ChrisWere> kamidi: What do you mean what wifi do I have?
[17:40] <Hans_Zero> brb need to check through both of the config files
[17:40] <kamidi> ChrisWere: I had problems with RaLink and i sorted it out by downloding sources and building them from their site and
[17:40] <rex> kamidi : not all issue are solved in fresh install. for 12.04 i have done 2 to times fresh install then most of the problem are solved
[17:40] <ChrisWere> kamidi: My drivers are included in the kernal. I bought the wifi card specifically because of that.
[17:41] <kamidi> rex: yes i know. i have had some luck in past too but now i try to solve problems without resorting to fresh install which is not so convenient
[17:42] <Evil_Eric> hey rex ive looked into something and it could be the wi-fi card also
[17:42] <kamidi> ChrisWere: mine was too but there is bug (RaLink RT3062) which caused it to be really slow

[17:44] <rex> chriswre --> now add these lines at last -->options ath9k nohwcrypt=1
[17:44] <ActionParsnip> Hans_Zero: the ID is just a prettiness, You can change it if you want, just the identifier needs to be unchanged
[17:44] <ActionParsnip> rex: why not run:    echo "options ath9k nohwcrypt=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf > /dev/null
[17:44] <ChrisWere> rex: that opens up an empty file
[17:44] <Hans_Zero> yes I was just looking for sync ranges If I need to adjust them

[18:15] <ActionParsnip> usr13: ~/.config is in all flavours of Ubuntu, regardless of DE, may apps use it to hold configs
[18:15] <Wiz_KeeD> really?
[18:16] <Wiz_KeeD> download it from dropbox instead of using the repository?
[18:16] <Wolseinstein> Any one?
[18:16] <Wiz_KeeD> :O
[18:16] <kristenbb_> can someone please help me to change the language in 12.04?
[18:16] <Evil_Sleeps> yep for sure its the intel graphics
[18:16] <s1lence> Wolseinstein: you should be able to acess his files if there's nothing wrong with the HDD itself. RAW format is for cameras though.
[18:16] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: its just easier, chrome isn't in the repos
[18:16] <genericus> Wiz_KeeD Official Chrome isn't in the repos but Chromium is

[18:18] <usr13> ActionParsnip: Yes, there is xfce4 and xfce4-session
[18:18] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: it is

[18:19] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: it installs in terminal instead, otherwise zero
[18:20] <ActionParsnip> insomniac_lemon: you'll need your backups to restore the data
[18:20] <Wiz_KeeD> so it's basically the same thing i see
[18:20] <insomniac_lemon> ActionParsnip, I didn't format it, can't I get the data back?
[18:20] <usr13> Ok, I stand corrected. rm -rf ~/.config/xfce4;rm -rf ~/.config/xfce4-session  #To set [only] xfce back to default
[18:21] <ActionParsnip> insomniac_lemon: why do you not have a backup if the data is important?
[18:21] <Wiz_KeeD> and quick question, why isn't chrome in the official repositories?
[18:21] <Wolseinstein> any pastebin site ?
[18:21] <s1lence> Wolseinstein: paste.ubuntu.com
[18:21] <insomniac_lemon> ActionParsnip because it was my storage drive
[18:21] <ActionParsnip> insomniac_lemon: you may find success with foremost, I suggest you look into a backup. Wht if the drive's IDE fails, where is your data?
[18:22] <ActionParsnip> insomniac_lemon: think about it......

My question is should these be defined in /.htaccess and if so, what are the sites-avilable & sites-enabled directorires used for?
[18:23] <usr13> Wiz_KeeD: Good question.  I would guess that it is prolly because Firefox is more mainstream, and it's a bit of a complication to have both.

[18:24] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: just because its default installed doesn't make it "closer" whatever that means.
[18:24] <ActionParsnip> dsa: why not just install the desktop OS?
[18:25] <Wiz_KeeD> did anyone have a problem when setting up multiple monitors that on the second monitor there is a gap on the right which you cannot eliminate?
[18:25] <usr13> Wiz_KeeD: I for one, find it not useful.  I do fine with Firefox and don't really need chrome or chromium   (But chromium IS in there, so...)

[18:29] <Wiz_KeeD> Wolseinstein, about?
[18:29] <Anonynom> gordonjcp, i know.. but my wired network is an inner one in the household, which i use for local services.
[18:29] <Anonynom> while the wireless is the internet access.
[18:29] <usr13> Anonynom: You could set the wired interface to static IP and no gateway....

[18:31] <Anonynom> usr13, in layman terms? :P
[18:31] <MonkeyDust> let's hear it, jcarmbruster
[18:31] <usr13> jcarmbruster: This is the right place.  (Just ask....)
[18:32] <ActionParsnip> delac: did you look for the 8 character hex ID from:    lsusb
[18:32] <jcarmbruster> okay, I'm using Windows XP, and my attempts to download have failed twice. It just hangs after 20 minutes. Suggestions?
[18:32] <genericus> Wolseinstein does the drive show up in Nautilus (the file browser)?
[18:33] <MonkeyDust> jcarmbruster  did you get it here? http://www.ubuntu.com/download
[18:33] <dcherniv> jcarmbruster, torrent
[18:33] <usr13> Anonynom: Ok.  Let's say that our router issues dynamic IPs to clients from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.200  You could use 192.168.1.99 and below, or 192.168.1.201 and above.
[18:33] <jcarmbruster> Yes, i got it there.
[18:33] <Wolseinstein> genericus,  how do i see nautilus ?

[18:34] <genericus> Wolseinstein by default it is on the launcher named "Home folder", it has a folder icon
[18:34] <usr13> Anonynom: Using an IP that is outside the DHCP pool will help you to avoid [possible] IP conflicts on your LAN.
[18:34] <delac> ActionParsnip: yes, the odd part is that the line claims the device is e220 while the print on the device says it is e160e
[18:34] <Anonynom> usr13, I see~
[18:34] <Global-447> buenas
[18:34] <ActionParsnip> delac: the print on the device is irrelevant
[18:34] <Global-447> emmm
[18:34] <delac> ActionParsnip: although it seems many huawei devices are recognized as e220...
[18:34] <usr13> Anonynom: Check your router's config to see where the pool is.
[18:34] <dsa> ActionParsnip, really i just want to mess with it.. either way like i said is behaving badly =/ i'll try lightdm and see but you are probably  right and i'll end up installing desktop version and install stuff manually as i go
[18:34] <ActionParsnip> delac: use the 8 character hex id to find guides

[19:15] <Cosmin> hello, can someone help me with gcc on ubuntu? i just started to use these and i need to learn alot
[19:15] <ActionParsnip> dsa: you may need an xorg.conf file to get 3D accelleration setup
[19:15] <Wiz_KeeD> c ya guys thanks for your help!
[19:15] <ActionParsnip> Cosmin: install build-essential to get a compiling environment :)
[19:15] <Cosmin> i build it
[19:15] <Cosmin> installed it*
[19:16] <s1lence> Cosmin: man gcc :)
[19:16] <ninp0> Cosmin, what ya tryin to do
[19:17] <dnewkirk> Cosmin: GCC has an extensive manual at the website for GCC. To really learn how to use the compilers, it's best to do a bit of reading there. It may be hard to answer complex questions via IRC :/
[19:17] <dsa> ActionParsnip, mmm nice then i'll have to search a bit more..

[19:21] <ActionParsnip> Cosmin: which file?
[19:21] <Cosmin> i made for the beggining a simple program that i have saved on the desktop
[19:21] <ActionParsnip> Cosmin: you don't have to put it anywhere special, you can compile in terminal

[19:21] <Cosmin> yea

[19:32] <dsa> ActionParsnip, you were right at least there is no xorg.conf in here

[19:33] <arvislacis> I need libxatr.acker1 (without dot) package, can anyone help?
[19:34] <arvislacis> With version number 8.0.4-ubuntu0.2
[19:34] <stupid-by-defaul> hello.. got litle work for some one..
[19:34] <kieppie3> I have a HTPC that was running (essentially) headless for a while now, serving up only XBMC. I recently upgraded to 12.10, which broke the display (ATI). I've tried resolving the issue, but getting nowhere. thought I'd use this opportunity to install ubuntu-desktop, but stuff's still borked. I've tried removing & purging & reinstalling x11, xserver, fglrx & orther display resources. anyone able to offer me any help, please?
[19:35] <blueribbon> ActionParsnip: omg omg omg omg it worked omg
[19:35] <blueribbon> :D
[19:35] <dcherniv> kieppie1, what driver fglrx or built in?
[19:35] <arvislacis> Any help for me?
[19:35] <drecute> dcherniv: no?
[19:36] <ActionParsnip> arvislacis: is the system a desktop OS?
[19:36] <dcherniv> drecute, as far as i know theres no way
[19:36] <dsa> ActionParsnip, so i wont probably need to install drivers,  just get good xorg.conf settings and it should work?
[19:36] <arvislacis> Yes
[19:36] <drecute> dcherniv: not even chroot
[19:36] <ActionParsnip> arvislacis: are you running Hardy?
[19:36] <arvislacis> No
[19:36] <arvislacis> Precise
[19:37] <kieppie3> hi dcherniv: GPU is an ATI Radeon 4350 HD. I've tried both the native & the ATI prop driver, but doesn't seem to work. I really want to scratch all display & start anew, but it seems there are remnants of stuff left behind
[19:37] <drecute> dcherniv: everytime I install zend server on the same system running php-fpm, zend server crashes the php-fpm
[19:37] <drecute> dcherniv: hence, i think i can use chroot to isolate the problem
[19:37] <ActionParsnip> arvislacis: http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/libxatracker1
[19:37] <arvislacis> ActionParsnip, I need to get deb package of libca.tr.acker
[19:38] <drecute> dcherniv: how will that be a problem?

[19:39] <arvislacis> ActionParsnip, Could you please get 8.0.4-0ubuntu0.2 version, rename it and send to me?

I tested my sound card on an older version of ubuntu I have, and it worked, its all working now, except on this ubuntu I am now, which is the most updated, here is the command: sudo add-apt-reposito
[20:27] <cheesecakes> just passwd will set the root password when you are the root user
[20:27] <d4rkh4nd8> okay awesoem thank you again
[20:28] <cheesecakes> anytime
[20:29] <Wiz_KeeD> or should i use the software center?
[20:31] <AndreeeCZ> ActionParsnip, im sorry. The GPU is there, its just not stated the vendor or model.
[20:31] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: i already fixed it when i'd come back....
[20:31] <ActionParsnip> !rootpass
[20:32] <Jaclyn> Hi
[20:32] <cheesecakes> ActionParsnip: fixed what?
[20:32] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: the password issue
[20:32] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: or were you advising someone how to reset their password in root prompt?
[20:32] <cheesecakes> oh i was helping d4rkh4nd8
[20:33] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: please don't advise how to set the root password
[20:33] <cheesecakes> may i ask why?
[20:33] <cheesecakes> i think it is a good security measure
[20:33] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: its not supported, advised or necessary in ubuntu
[20:33] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: its worse, you have another account active, not better at all
[20:34] <cheesecakes> but isnt root active by default?
[20:34] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: the account is disabled for a reason
[20:34] <cheesecakes> or am i confusing distros
[20:34] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: by people I am very sure know more about Linux than you do
[20:36] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: if the user forgets their password, easy access to root console is really handy. If they also forget their root password then guess who has to dig them out?
[20:36] <Jaclyn> Is anyone willing to help me with two hardware problems and a wine problem?
[20:36] <AceBlade258> Jaclyn: hardware
[20:36] <cheesecakes> the recovery mode would help
[20:36] <AceBlade258> let's start there
[20:37] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: they will need the root password to log in there, which has been forgotten....
[20:37] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: think
[20:37] <cheesecakes> ahh
[20:37] <cheesecakes> then the shadow file comes into play
[20:37] <cheesecakes> lol you are right sorry
[20:37] <Jaclyn> ok. Well, I upgraded from 11.10 to 12.10, and now ubuntu refuses to register anything plugged into one of my USB ports, and says that I have 1.7GiB of RAM when I have 2GB
[20:38] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: if you want to set it on your system that's fine. But don't advise average users who may be new to Linux how to do it
[20:38] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: it makes more work for supported
[20:38] <cosmicfires> what's a good usb tv stick to use with ubuntu?
[20:38] <AceBlade258> Jaclyn: Only one usb port?
[20:38] <Jaclyn> Yup
[20:38] <Jaclyn> Just one
[20:38] <cheesecakes> ok cool will remeber this
[20:38] <Jaclyn> It has power, but if I plug a mouse or a keyboard or anything into it, it doesn't work.
[20:38] <ActionParsnip> Jaclyn: did you upgrade to Precise in between?
[20:38] <Jaclyn> Yes
[20:39] <cheesecakes> will not recommend setting the root password
[20:39] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: thanks :)
[20:39] <Jaclyn> I used the update manager to go from 11.10 > 12.04 >12.10
[20:39] <ActionParsnip> Jaclyn: do you have an onboard video chip?
[20:39] <Jaclyn> Yes
[20:39] <AceBlade258> Jaclyn: ram isn't a big deal, are you using/do you have integrated graphics?
[20:39] <cheesecakes> no problem
[20:39] <Jaclyn> BEcause I have a crappy 2006 laptop
[20:39] <ActionParsnip> Jaclyn: its using the system ram for the video RAM
[20:40] <Jaclyn> ok.
[20:40] <AceBlade258> Jaclyn: you can change the ammount used in the bios
[20:40] <Jaclyn> Hmm
[20:40] <Jaclyn> Well
[20:40] <Jaclyn> That's fine
[20:40] <Jaclyn> I just wanted to know where it was
[20:40] <AceBlade258> Jaclyn: however, you should leave it where it's at, 256 is a decent graphics ram
[20:40]  * Jaclyn planned on leaving it there
[20:41] <AceBlade258> sorry, i tend to not read as i type
[20:42] <Jaclyn> issok. But what's going on with the USB port?
[20:42] <ActionParsnip> Jaclyn: do you have a usb keyboard?
[20:42] <Jaclyn> Yes
[20:42] <Wiz_KeeD> guys, can anyone tell me how to install java oracle on ubuntu 12.04 lts?
[20:42] <Wiz_KeeD> the safe way :)
[20:42] <ActionParsnip> Jaclyn: does the numlock key light if you press the numlock key?
[20:42] <Wiz_KeeD> there is always multiple ways of doing it and i'd hate to mess things up on a fresh install
[20:42] <Jaclyn> No.
=== Sierr[a]AR is now known as SierraAR
[20:43] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html
[20:43] <Wiz_KeeD> using ubuntu software?
[20:43] <Jaclyn> If I plug my mouse into the port it lights up for a second and then turns off
[20:43] <ActionParsnip> Jaclyn: sounds like the USB ports are disabled. Are they enabled in BIOS?
[20:43] <Jaclyn> YEs
[20:43] <Jaclyn> If I boot up windows the USB ports work just fine
[20:43] <Jaclyn> It's just that one USB port
[20:43] <xjkx> is there any way to restore ubuntu to..as if it was just installed now, removing everything added, just like brand new again without burning cds, and losing /home
[20:43] <Wiz_KeeD> ActionParsnip, isn't java 8 out?
[20:44] <Jaclyn> The other two USB ports work just fine
[20:44] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: yes, its on that ppa too....
[20:44] <Wiz_KeeD> so should i replace 7 with 8?
[20:44] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: yes........
[20:45] <Wiz_KeeD> it has some freakish terminal menu instead of a nice gui ActionParsnip :))
[20:45] <Wiz_KeeD> from where to accept the terms and conditions
[20:46] <brontosaurusrex> xjkx: if home is on separate parition then yes
[20:46] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: use TAB and ENTER to accept the license
[20:46] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: not freakish at all
[20:46] <xjkx> brontosaurusrex: no, its not. I dont mean reinstall, just restore it
[20:46] <Wiz_KeeD> yes i did that, was just wondering why it has that old-school interface to it
[20:46] <xjkx> its broken now
[20:46] <Wiz_KeeD> when in some examples it showed a proper gui comming up when installing java
[20:46] <brontosaurusrex> xjkx: i see, dunno about that
[20:47] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: lots of things have a text interface
[20:47] <MonkeyDust> tip for future reference: hardinfo is a nice gui tool
[20:47] <Wiz_KeeD> maybe the java7 was different idk
[20:48] <Jaclyn> So. Do you have any idea why my USB port would do that? It was working just fine before I upgraded.
[20:49] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: its an installer using the tar.gz from the java site, the deb is just a jandy way to install it. Nothing more
=== matt_ is now known as Guest58851
[20:49] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: you can do it manually using the archive, the deb just does it for you
[20:50] <BluesKaj> Jaclyn, if you run lsusb , does it show ?
[20:50] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: the java will also update as the PPA is updated
[20:51] <Mrokii> Hello. I want to create an encrypted archive with Archive manager but I can't seem to active encryption of the filelist itself.
[20:51] <Guest58851> Hey, I was wondering if anyone could help me here. My Problem is: I have a D-Link DWL-G570
[20:51] <Guest58851> And, I cant seem to connect to a network
[20:51] <Mrokii> I mean, the option to encrypt the filelist in Archive Manager is ghosted.
[20:52] <conall> Is there any way I can sync a folder to another partition easily WITHOUT ENCRIPTION?
[20:52] <Jaclyn> It shows 5. I have three USB ports, a card slot, and A CF slot. Do you think the other two are those?
[20:52] <Reptile_Skillz> Hey, I was wondering if anyone could help me. My Network card is working, It can list the nearby networks... But it wont connect to them, even with the correct password! Could someone please help me?
[20:53] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: what are you connecting to them to achieve?
[20:53] <Reptile_Skillz> A Conenction to surf the web
[20:53] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: is it running a proxy software?
[20:54] <Jaclyn> BluesKaj: It shows five.
[20:54] <Reptile_Skillz> Nope.
[20:54] <luckyphuq> conall: use GRSYNC (a frontend for rsync)
[20:54] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: do other systems connect to it ok?
[20:54] <BluesKaj> Jaclyn, can you paste the output in pastebin
[20:54] <conall> thanks luckyphuq
[20:54] <Jaclyn> k
[20:54] <Reptile_Skillz> ActionParsnip, Yes, But same problem.. I dont get it.
[20:55] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: can you ping 8.8.8.8 through the system?
[20:55] <Reptile_Skillz> ActionParsnip,  Yeah, One sec. let me try that
[20:56] <Reptile_Skillz> ActionParsnip,  Nope. It doesnt let me connect.. It keeps on saying Conenction for about 10 minuites before fail.
[20:56] <Jaclyn> BluesKaj: http://pastebin.com/VZhLBYeQ
[20:56] <Wiz_KeeD> everything worked ActionParsnip thank you
[20:56] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: check routing then
[20:57] <n0sq> some stuff won't play in firefox from usatoday.com - don't know what i'm missing
[20:57] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: no wrries. The PPA makes life a lot easier
[20:57] <kgs> topper4125: here? :)
[20:57] <Reptile_Skillz> ActionParsnip,  I have. Ive also rebooted my Router And Modem.
[20:57] <Wiz_KeeD> i saw these instructions on some other site using google but i never got which way is the best to go
[20:57] <Wiz_KeeD> using software center, apt-get from repositories, adding other repositories and then isntalling, using debs to install
[20:57] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: why are you using a system to get web access if you have a router?
[20:57] <Wiz_KeeD> there are so many ways
[20:58] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: there are lots of ways to do many things in any OS
[20:58] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah well installing in ubuntu has many of them :))
[20:58] <Reptile_Skillz> ActionParsnip,  No, I have a Wireless Router, And Im too far away to use a cable. I only have 1 cable in the house, And my Wireless card on my dekstop )Non Built In) Doesnt work
[20:59] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: did you setup the connection sharing in the other OS correctly?
[20:59] <Reptile_Skillz> ActionParsnip,  Yeah, I Did. My dad is even stumped on this one
[20:59] <BluesKaj> Jaclyn, that looks very normal , perhaps your mouse only works with USB2.0 , the others appear to be the older USB version 1.1
[20:59] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: can you ping the sharing system ok?
