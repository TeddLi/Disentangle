[00:53] <Nikon> I'm in windows at the moment and i dont have a issue
[00:54] <Ari-Yang> Nikon, what kind of graphics does your laptop have?
[00:54] <wilee-nilee> themanwithnoface, the kernels and grub are updated through the ubuntu repos in any release, however they may not ne the latest released to the public, but the ones the developers have setup to run in ubuntu
[00:54] <Nikon> Ati
[00:54] <Ari-Yang> Nikon, what card?

[00:55] <Ari-Yang> hmm
[00:55] <Matisse> melanie, try    dmesg | grep -C3 irq    .... but if that gives you 1000 lines... it wont be helpful :)
[00:55] <Ari-Yang> Nikon, the only thing that comes to my mind of ATI/AMD laptops overheating with ubuntu is the open source radeon driver...which is known for making laptop's hot
[00:55] <themanwithnoface> wilee-nilee: ahhh i see i see, so like defaults , right?  ok, .. poop. i just upgraded to 3.9 .. lol ah well. how do i find out what the newest stable version of grub is? im on the homepage..
[00:55] <wilee-nilee> themanwithnoface, why are you worried about grub?
[00:55] <Nikon> Ari-Yang: i was concered about the kernal, 3.0 if i remember correctly has problems with over heating
[00:56] <downbeam> Matisse, i dont need the disk to boot i just need it to run an iso image
[00:56] <Nikon> i was going to try and install 11.04

[00:56] <melanie> Matisse: it gave no lines
[00:56] <wilee-nilee> Nikon, 11.04 is eol and not supported
[00:56] <Ari-Yang> Nikon, yeah, that's why I upgraded to kernel 3.10...
[00:56] <Ari-Yang> Nikon, though when I installed ubuntu on this laptop, I could install it, it didn't overheat :/
[00:56] <Matisse> melanie, then just paste  dmesg
[00:57] <Nikon> wilee-nilee: i was going to install 11.04 to install then update to the lts
[00:57] <Ari-Yang> Nikon, I dunno, maybe install an older version of ubuntu then install 12.04...

[00:58] <Ari-Yang> subcool, need more details, too vauge...
[00:58] <jrib> subcool: give details when you ask your question (use a pastebin for errors, logs, commands, etc.)
[00:58] <subcool> -f install causes the system to try to install the package
[00:58] <Matisse> downbeam, ok, then i cant help you. the others might need more information about what your trying too
[00:58] <{{> let's see how long it takes until netsplit
[00:58] <Matisse> wilee-nilee, which ubuntu version do you have with libreoff 4.0 ?
[00:58] <themanwithnoface> wilee-nilee:  so now i'm sticking with 13.04 until the next LTS.. and trying to update everything, i have GRUB 2.00-13ubuntu3
[00:59] <subcool> java-jre is not updating... it erros
[00:59] <jrib> subcool: 1) -f install is not a command 2) give full input and output in a pastebin
[00:59] <wilee-nilee> themanwithnoface, the grub in the ubuntu repos is considered stable I have never had a problem with it. I am sensing a b it of a flailing about here am I correct. ;)
[01:00] <Ari-Yang> Matisse, you may know that libreoffice 4.0 may not be in ubuntu's official repos (which tend to have stable things). Though you can get a 4.0 repo with a stable version
[01:00] <themanwithnoface> wilee-nilee:  hmm?  lol  what do you mean?  i am a hypochondriac with computers that's for sure... :(
[01:00] <Ari-Yang> Matisse, can't remember which is more stable between 4.0 and 4.1
[01:01] <wilee-nilee> themanwithnoface, Ah, you have to be careful with an OS your given enough power to brick easily is all.
[01:01] <Matisse> Ari-Yang, i just want to know if 4.0 is stable with 12.04  ... and i think that wilee-nilee   uses something newer
[01:01] <subcool> Ok- here is something. And its not something ive seen before http://paste.ubuntu.com/6038602
[01:01] <melanie> Matisse: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6038603/
[01:01] <Ari-Yang> Matisse, whatever is marked as stable, is most likely stable for all ubuntu versions...
[01:01] <wilee-nilee> is pretty tough but you have to use informed information and correct techniques
[01:01] <Matisse> melanie, still trying? let me help
[01:01] <wilee-nilee> it's*
[01:02] <Matisse> melanie, dmesg > log-dmesg.txt
[01:02] <Ari-Yang> Matisse, latest stable is 4.1.0, which should be stable on all ubuntu versions
[01:02] <Ari-Yang> just try it
[01:02] <Ari-Yang> and if things go wrong, you can always uninstall it, Matisse.
[01:02] <Matisse> ok, thx
[01:03] <Ari-Yang> yw
[01:03] <melanie> Matisse: the pastebin link i posted should work... but the output of dmesg isn't looking too helpful
[01:03] <Matisse> melanie, nothing useful in there :)  are other things working?
[01:04] <themanwithnoface> wilee-nilee:  i see...  noted and thanks friend :)  i'm really just procrastinating on my C work...
[01:04] <wilee-nilee> themanwithnoface, I would not update it out of what the distro provides in general unless there is an obvious fail.

[01:05] <Matisse> melanie, did the same. worked for me
[01:05] <themanwithnoface> wilee-nilee:  hmm yeah some issues arose earlier with some program... can't remember... might have been the vim upgrade or something
[01:06] <Matisse> melanie, maybe you only got the end of dmesg
[01:06] <Matisse> try to output into a file and look if theres more
[01:10] <Ari-Yang> [21:06:22] <Matisse> melanie, maybe you only got the end of dmesg ---> she is not here.. she quit saying 'brb'

[02:08] <kabamaro> ok  uddy
[02:08] <kabamaro> buddy
[02:11] <kairos> So my system keeps going into low graphics mode on boot
[02:12] <BenyaminL> halo
[02:13] <histo> kairos: what kind of graphics card?
[02:13] <kairos> histo: None
[02:13] <BenyaminL> Hmmm, anyone know is the LTS 14.04 will be the stable one with XMIR?
[02:15] <histo> kairos: That's interesting then how do you have video output?
[02:15] <holstein> kairos: you have some graphics card.. what is the brand?
[02:15] <histo> BenyaminL: yes 14.04 will be the next LTS
[02:15] <holstein> kairos: have you set a custom xorg.conf?
[02:16] <histo> !releases | BenyaminL
[02:16] <ubottu> BenyaminL: Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months. Each version is supported for 9 months to 5 years. More info at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases & http://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases
[02:16] <kairos> histo: Heh. Sorry. I meant integrated
[02:16] <kairos> holstein: No.
[02:16] <histo> kairos: okay, well it still has a chipset so lspci | grep VGA    will shed some light on the matter
[02:16] <SonikkuAmerica> BenyaminL: Also, 14.04 will be Lubuntu's first LTS.
[02:16] <dr_willis> mir still needs a lot of work from what im reading.
[02:17] <BenyaminL> @Histo :no, i mean will it stable with XMIR?
[02:17] <holstein> mir or no, 14.04 should be LTS
[02:17] <histo> BenyaminL: Don't know you'd have to ask the dev team. I think as we approach 13.10 we will get a better idea.
[02:17] <SonikkuAmerica> BenyaminL: Xubuntu is the only *buntu that will have XMir
[02:17] <kairos> histo: sprunge.us/FQRS
[02:17] <kairos> Sorry if that's wrong. Can't copy or paste
[02:17] <dr_willis> mir and stable.   :-(  who can tell at this point
[02:17] <SonikkuAmerica> BenyaminL: (if they decide to put it in)
[02:17] <kabamaro> how do i unrar .rar files?
[02:17] <kabamaro> when i apt-get install unrar
[02:17] <kabamaro> no packages found
[02:18] <SonikkuAmerica> kabamaro: Get p7zip-full
[02:18] <jrib> !info unrar | kabamaro
[02:18] <ubottu> kabamaro: unrar (source: unrar-nonfree): Unarchiver for .rar files (non-free version) - binary program. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1:4.2.4-0.3 (raring), package size 116 kB, installed size 265 kB
[02:18] <jrib> kabamaro: make sure you have multiverse enabled
[02:18] <histo> kairos: What do you mean by low graphics mode?
[02:18] <BenyaminL> @SonnikkuAmerica : really good :) but i face many problem on 13.04 lubuntu, is it safety upgrade to 13.10 and to 14.04?
[02:18] <histo> kabamaro: unrar-nonfree I believe it's called
[02:18] <dr_willis> unrar --help     for the syntax
[02:18] <kairos> histo: I get a popup that says something along the lines of switching to low graphics mode
[02:19] <xmetal> i need to readup more on LTS's
[02:19] <histo> Kabaka: unrar-free
[02:19] <kairos> It has several options. Troubleshoot, start in low-graphics mode, reoncifugre, etc
[02:19] <kairos> reconfigure*
[02:19] <BenyaminL> @SonikkuAmerica : i heard xubuntu using x11?
[02:19] <histo> kairos: What version of ubuntu are you booting and how?
[02:20] <kairos> histo: 12.10 via TTY
[02:20] <SonikkuAmerica> BenyaminL: Let me check with the Xubuntu party. There might be too much helium in their balloons.
[02:20] <aMoniker> How can I tell which version do-release-upgrade will upgrade to?
[02:20] <aMoniker> I want to move from 11.10 to 12.04... I don't want 13.04 by mistake
[02:21] <histo> kairos: I have no idea what menu you are speaking of perhaps you can take a picture of it and post to imgbin or somewhere

[02:21] <SonikkuAmerica> aMoniker: You can only upgrade to the next version by that method.
[02:21] <BenyaminL> SonikkuAmerica : Ok Bro, i'll back for the other news :) i wana take breakfast *watching the conjuring :)
[02:21] <dr_willis> aMoniker:  it should  go  lts to lts..  or nonlts to next release
[02:21] <xmetal> hmm LTS's allow you to update to the lastest software packages without having to upgrade the entire OS?
[02:21] <SonikkuAmerica> BenyaminL: ... Breakfast? Eastern Hemisphere?
[02:21] <aMoniker> SonikkuAmerica: What's the next step from 11.10?
[02:21] <histo> aMoniker: it will only upgrade to the next release. If youa re running LTS you can go LTS > LTS
[02:21] <histo> aMoniker: 12.04
[02:21] <SonikkuAmerica> aMoniker: Read what histo said.
[02:21] <aMoniker> histo: ok good, thanks
[02:23] <histo> xmetal: No not the latest.
[02:24] <kairos> histo: No, I can't. I can't run programs while that menu is open
[02:25] <histo> kairos: with your cell phone or digital camera
[02:26] <histo> kairos: is this the installation cd or an installed system that you are booting?
[02:27] <kairos> histo: Installed
[02:28] <kairos> Just started happening after a reboot a while ago
[02:29] <histo> kairos: what happens after you make a selection?

[02:32] <kairos> histo: When I select 'Enter low-graphics mode for one session', it says the display is going to restart. It just hangs, though. When I select 'reoncigure configuration', I get two options: Use default config, or use my backed-up config. Nothing happens when I select either of those. Troubleshoot the error gives me xserver log file, with no way to paste it. However, I don't see any errors or anything that would cause this
[02:33] <AcidRain2012> somsip, im watching the video now. its just bashing unity
[02:33] <somsip> AcidRain2012: it's not a support issue, so it's OT at best
[02:34] <AcidRain2012> ot?
[02:34] <AcidRain2012> off topic
[02:34] <AcidRain2012> got ya
[02:34] <histo> kairos: Is this a unity message like GUI based or grub based message text based?
[02:34] <somsip> AcidRain2012: yes. Try #ubuntu-offtopic for general chats
[02:34] <somsip> AcidRain2012: thanks
[02:34] <histo> kairos: before or after you login?
[02:34] <kairos> histo: GUI. And before.
[02:36] <histo> kairos: What were you doing just prior to this starting?
[02:37] <kairos> histo: I had exited i3 to try a new WM, and my system hung. I reboot, and this happened.
[02:37] <histo> kairos: is your hard drive full?

[02:43] <majornick> hey yall. Ubuntu 13.04 here. wondereing if anyone knows of a app for recording my voice in a tweaked way. i want to do a podacast anonymously. i have several mics. i just need an app that can record my voice in an alternate persona. anyyone know of an app that can do this?
[02:44] <nerdtron> record as normal voice and then pass a filter in audacity to alter your voice
[02:44] <majornick> ok so record normal and then "audacity" is the app i use to filter the audio?
[02:45] <Gnarly> yes, that can adjust the timbre and the like in the same program
[02:45] <nerdtron> majornick yes, you can install it from the software center
[02:45] <majornick> great!
[02:45] <histo> majornick: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=899218
[02:46] <nerdtron> BTW, majornick audacity can't save MP3 by default... I think it needs a LAME.dll ( at least in windows) to be able to export MP3. other formats are good to go
[02:46] <histo> majornick: http://lobstertech.com/voice_changer.html
[02:48] <majornick> i am on Ubuntu 13.04 so i hope audacity works for me as i dont need real time changing. thanks. i got confused when i looked before because everyone wants real time changing for skype or whatever. looks like audacity will work for what i need. thanks again
[02:49] <wilee-nilee> Has not the LTS Enablement Stack for 12.04 been set up for 64 bit?
[02:51] <kairos> Great. Timed out.
[02:54] <kairos> histo: Ugh. This is weird. lightdm nor slim worked, but kdm is
[02:54] <kairos> Also I don't have mouse support. Nice.
[02:54] <histo> kairos: were you perhaps messing with file permissions also?
[02:54] <kairos> No
[02:55] <histo> kairos: weird. Something has gone wrong with your config files most likely.
[02:55] <kairos> Which ones should I take a look at, do you think?
[02:55] <histo> wilee-nilee: what enablement stack?
[02:56] <POo> lol

[03:03] <NeverHere> kabamaro, what do you mean certian server name? like a domain name?
[03:04] <kabamaro> its running on a wrong ip address
[03:04] <kabamaro>  * Starting web server apache2                                                  apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 100.70.226.126 for ServerName
[03:04] <kabamaro> 100.70.226.126
[03:04] <kabamaro> thats local
[03:04] <kabamaro> so its not working when i use it
[03:05] <NeverHere> not sure, never heard of apache doing that before
[03:05] <nerdtron> kabamaro what is your /etc/hosts contain?
[03:05] <NeverHere> usually localhost is 127.0.0.1
[03:05] <NeverHere> you can find out with hostname command

[03:10] <histo> kabamaro: I can't even get a ping response from that ip btw
[03:10] <histo> kabamaro: also you IP is owned by microsoft so that's rather odd
[03:11] <kabamaro> yeah its firewalled
[03:11] <kabamaro> yes man, microsoft is hosting it
[03:11] <kabamaro> nvm i fixed it
[03:11] <kabamaro> it was a firewall problem
[03:13] <kabamaro> can you help me with 1 more thing?
[03:13] <kabamaro> i have postfix installed but its not sending emails
[03:15] <kabamaro> should i have port 25 UDP/TCP or only TCP?

[03:18] <NeverHere> histo, eh whut lol doesn't postfix recieve the email on the server and forward to the correct inbox of the user?
[03:18] <nerdtron> kabamaro sending newsletters if you don't own a mail domain is considered spam
[03:18] <NeverHere> like sendmail

[03:21] <wizard_> evening, everyone. I made a stupid mistake. I was updating drivers on one of my boxes and accidentally installed nvidia drivers on a box with Intel 4600. now I get a black screen when I log in using Unity. I'm on the fallback gui at the moment
[03:23] <usr13> wizard_: sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:23] <majornick> wizard_: oh your fine. these guys will have you sorted out in no time
[03:24] <wizard_> "no such file or directory" when I tried that
[03:24] <usr13> wizard_: Uninstall the Nvidia driver.
[03:24] <majornick> usr13: thats what i was thinking lol
[03:24] <usr13> wizard_: How did you install it?
[03:25] <usr13> wizard_: did you use the package manager?
[03:25] <wizard_> I actually did. before I did, I was getting a blank screen. I could see my desktop background but nothing else. after uninstalling it I have a black screen lol
[03:25] <wizard_> I used the terminal. give me a sec and I'll pull up what I did
[03:25] <majornick> wizard_: so now install the correct driver?
[03:26] <wizard_> sudo apt-get update
[03:26] <wizard_> sudo apt-get upgrade
[03:26] <usr13> wizard_: ls -ltr /var/lib/dpkg/info/   #Will show you the latest packages last.
[03:26] <wizard_> sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[03:26] <wizard_> ok let me give that a try. thanks so far by the way, everyone
[03:26] <usr13> wizard_: sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current
[03:26] <majornick> && sudo apt-get install intel-current?
[03:27] <wizard_> intet-current doesn't seem to be a thing. let me see if it's named something else
[03:28] <majornick> wizard_: no
[03:28] <majornick> dont listen to me
[03:28] <majornick> wizard_: i am a noob thts why i put the question mark after that
[03:28] <usr13> majornick: no
[03:28] <wizard_> oh lol
[03:28] <wizard_> I already removed nvidia-current
[03:28] <wizard_> sudo apt-get remove nvidia
[03:29] <wizard_> either way
[03:29] <usr13> wizard_: lspci   #Tell us the line that describes your video card.

[03:33] <usr13> wizard_: lspci |grep VGA
[03:33] <majornick> usr13: he caught the typo
[03:34] <usr13> majornick: Why would he use imagebin?
[03:34] <mhr> okay, so this is it http://www.mediatek.com/_en/07_downloads/01_windows.php?sn=501, but I can't figure out how to download the file! (which is called RT539x PCIe)
[03:34] <usr13> majornick: Rather than pastebin ?

[03:35] <wizard_> ok, everything is copied. want me to paste it here or would that be too much spam?

[03:56] <TheRC51> Ben64: Didn't work. Still went straight to Windows 8
[03:56] <StaticSilva> TheRC5, I had the same problem. Not really sure how I fixed it.
[03:56] <Ben64> TheRC51: then either you didn't set the correct drive to boot, or grub isn't installed, or maybe a secret third option
[03:57] <TheRC51> Correct drive was set. I know that for sure.
[03:57] <TheRC51> Grub should have installed with Ubuntu. No errors came up.
[03:57] <Ben64> !boot-repair
[03:57] <Ben64> hmm...
[03:57] <wizard_> hey, I'm back. looks like I'm back to a blank desktop with only my background visible when I choose unity as my DE
[03:57] <Ben64> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[03:58] <Ben64> you could try that from a livecd/usb and see what it says
[03:58] <wizard_> if worse comes to worse I'll back my files up on an external drive and reinstall. not the end of the world
[03:58] <TheRC51> Boot from live usb?

[03:58] <Ben64> yeah
[03:58] <TheRC51> Ok I will try that.

[04:01] <StaticSilva> more like*
[04:02] <usr13> wizard_: I think you just need to reset unity.
[04:02] <usr13> wizard_: unity --restart
[04:03] <lotuspsychje> Ben64: !recovery maybe?
[04:03] <wizard_> will that work from the DE I'm currently in?

[04:07] <dec0d3r> TheRC51, this might help http://askubuntu.com/questions/83771/recovering-grub-after-installing-windows-7
[04:07] <StaticSilva> I would, but then my games would look terrible
[04:08] <b_> dec0d3r he is on win 8 though
[04:08] <b_> staticsilva have you tried it?
[04:09] <Ari-Yang> StaticSilva, then dual boot?
[04:09] <Ari-Yang> boot into windows when you want to game and boot into ubuntu for everything else?
[04:09] <dec0d3r> i'm noob on win 8, but wouldn't it be the same?
[04:09] <StaticSilva> When I tried dual booting I ended up mostly using Windows for everything and not using Ubuntu
[04:09] <Ari-Yang> StaticSilva, and using a virtual machine for gaming may not be so great.... unless you're on a high power machine I guess
[04:09] <Ari-Yang> StaticSilva, then just stick with Windows? *shrugs*
[04:10] <StaticSilva> Its mostly though because I'm used to it
[04:10] <StaticSilva> But I hate WIndows

[04:15] <Ari-Yang> ^ TheRC51
[04:15] <Ari-Yang> you might be interested? *shrugs*
[04:15] <TheRC51> Currently going through one. Thanks though Ari-Yang . I'll try yours if this current one doesn't work.
[04:16] <StaticSilva> Might have to try that tutorial gain
[04:16] <StaticSilva> again, all though it seems like something always goes wrong that isn't explained in it
[04:17] <wizard_> heh, I guess I'm just not having luck tonight
[04:18] <StaticSilva> The biggest problem I have though is figuring out how to disable Secure Boot in my Bios
[04:19] <StaticSilva> By the way is that tutorial about dual booting when each OS is on a different drive?
[04:19] <Silver_Arrow> I just installed qtsixa to try and use a PS3 Sixaxis controller for a game in wine. How can I tell if the problem is the system not recognizing the controller, or just the game?
[04:19] <b_> staticsilva read it and see man
[04:19] <b_> lol
[04:22] <TheRC51> Got onto step 4. These are the instructions
[04:22] <TheRC51> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install grub-pc sudo grub-setup /dev/sda     # NOTE THAT THERE IS NO DIGIT sudo umount /boot
[04:23] <TheRC51> But I ran into an issue running sudo grup-setup /dev/sda
[04:23] <TheRC51> The error said the command was not found
[04:23] <wizard_> no luck with "unity --restart". I may just start from scratch
[04:24] <TheRC51> any ideas Ben64
[04:24] <StaticSilva> So besides Ubuntu, what Distros do you guys use?
[04:25] <Ari-Yang> StaticSilva, there are dozens of Linux distros...
[04:25] <Johnny_Linux> NOT WINDOZE
[04:25] <Johnny_Linux> oops
[04:25] <Ari-Yang> remember StaticSilva this is a support channel for off topic stuff join #ubuntu-offtopic
[04:26] <StaticSilva> oh ok. didn't know
[04:26] <TheRC51> Ari-Yang did you see the recent error that I mentioned?
[04:28] <Ari-Yang> TheRC51, nope, and not really an expert when it comes to this. Though if I were you, I'd google the error and find threads and topics about it to see if there are any answers that may help me.
[04:28] <TheRC51> Yeah, i'm currently doing that now. Thanks though.

[04:59] <reveal> Hello all, I am in need of installing an EOL version of Ubuntu, Ubuntu 11.04 i386 desktop. My school teacher will only allow this version to be used with lab assignments. I tried to use wubi but it fails even if i modify the manifest to replace old-version. Is there a way to get natty with wubi
[05:01] <uw> good luck with that one
[05:02] <reveal> yeah ive read lots of posts no success
[05:02] <qin> reveal: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/11.04/ what prevents you from using live system?
[05:02] <toketokensen> anybody have any luck installing on an hp envy h9?  ubuntu installs just fine with or without uefi and secure boot enabled but boots to a black screen and can't install grub
[05:02] <toketokensen> any ideas?
[05:02] <AcidRain2012> no no qin. u jail the user into a directory. root has to have ownership of it. and permissions have to be set. that is pretty secure ftp :o
[05:02] <reveal> qin: id prefer the less headache route of install with a gui inside windows less afraid to jack stuff up
[05:03] <toketokensen> i don't want windows 8 ever
[05:03] <reveal> does anyone know wif there are any SUPER major revisions from 11.04 to current
[05:03] <toketokensen> lke even with a clean wipe/install it doesn't work
[05:03] <Ben64> reveal: 11.04 is no longer supported, you can do what you want, but you're on your own with it
[05:04] <reveal> Ben64: Yeah I saw that but with it being no longer supported can't use wubi
[05:04] <MH53_Intel> gui install from windows sounds like more of a headache to me fwiw ;)
[05:04] <Ben64> wubi is not a good solution anyway
[05:04] <wilee-nilee> toketokensen, This thread may help. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2147295
[05:04] <Ben64> reveal: you should use 12.04 or 13.04, as they are still supported here
[05:04] <reveal> Yeah.
[05:04] <qin> reveal: get unertbootin, usb drive, install foolproof system; wonder if unetbootin will install line natty...
[05:05] <reveal> I tried the pen drive ubuntu method
[05:05] <reveal> slow as malasys
[05:05] <qin> reveal: hehe
[05:05] <reveal> Ben64: do you know if there are any realy changes between the 11.04 to 13.04
[05:05] <Ben64> tons of changes
[05:06] <reveal> i emailed my teacher tell him im not going to install an outdated distro on my computer and be vulnerable to people
[05:06] <Ben64> smart idea
[05:06] <reveal>  the i386 version of Ubuntu 11.04 are the only official distributions for this class. These are the only distributions that the labs have been tested against and verified to work with. These are also the only distributions for which students can expect any instructor support. Students attempting to use any other distributions or distribution versions may find that the labs do not work correctly for them. Such students, if they ask for help, will only be told

[05:35] <gbushprogs> the easy way to fix that permanently is to put the export command at the end of your .bashrc file. That's the dirty way to do it.

[05:48] <magnetron> hi, how would i restrict which usb devices can be recognized on which ports? i want to put my computer at a physically secure location and extend the USB to a certain point, but i only want a specific device being able to connect to that USB port
[05:49] <jpds> magnetron: udev rules.
[05:49] <magnetron> jpds: good. would i have to edit all the udev rules for all supported devices, to be able to restrict them?
[05:49] <jpds> magnetron: Of course, someone could fake the USB ID of a device.
[05:50] <magnetron> jpds: yes, but as long as they don't fake another type of USB device, i don't care
[05:50] <jpds> magnetron: No, you create a file with some rules that say: "allow *this* device" and another telling it to ignore the rest.
[05:50] <reveal> Ben64: I installed ubuntu 12 not a big fan of the gui LOL
[05:50] <jpds> magnetron: I've done it before, but can't remmeber the syntax off the top of my head.
[05:51] <gbushprogs> james: I would think any process running with your credentials could edit your $PS1
[05:51] <jpds> magnetron: You'll want to put this in /etc/udev/rules.d .

[05:55] <james-ubc> i'll do this tmr
[05:55] <james-ubc> thanks
[05:55] <gbushprogs> reveal -- not if it's executing a change to the $PS1 variable after /etc/profile has already executed and .bashrc has already executed. Seems like something could be added to /etc/profile to execute another file and change $PS1
[05:56] <gbushprogs> In which case, in light of /etc/profile and .bashrc there's a few places to hide a "(precise)" in there somewhere.
[05:57] <gbushprogs> oh well, chances are he logs in tomorrow and it doesn't do it, ROFL, I love computers

[06:32] <usr13> MikeD412: Your hard drive.
[06:32] <MikeD412> my c drive is my hdd
[06:32] <usr13> MikeD412:  So what does "c drive" mean?  (Think about it....)
[06:33] <user258467> I click on an Icon on my dock and nothing happen is there a log for that problem?
[06:33] <usr13> MikeD412: Continue with the install.
[06:34] <usr13> MikeD412: So, by now, you realize that your "c drive" is *not* your hdd.  Right?
[06:35] <MikeD412> yeah
[06:35] <usr13> MikeD412: Your Hard Drive consists of several partitions, (the "c drive" is what MS Windows calls one of them).

[06:37] <MrSassyPants> update-rc.d , but what's the menu-based one called?
[06:38] <usr13> MrSassyPants: It is the way you introduce new init scripts to your system.
[06:39] <MrSassyPants> usr13, er, yea, but iirc there was some menu based thing where you got a list of start scripts
[06:39] <MrSassyPants> and you could just toggle them on and off
[06:40] <MrSassyPants> rcconf! that was it
[06:40] <usr13> !upstart | MrSassyPants

[06:41] <usr13> !info rcconf | MrSassyPants
[06:41] <ubottu> MrSassyPants: rcconf (source: rcconf): Debian Runlevel configuration tool. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.5ubuntu2 (raring), package size 20 kB, installed size 108 kB

[06:45] <nowayride> Hey guys, any ideas on this? I installed mumble and during the audio setup input got mangled, my mic is only receiving nothing or very loud (like yelling into the mic) input, tried even uninistalling mumble/pulseaudio, running full updates, reinstalling, nothing
[06:46] <nowayride> It's not just mumble, it's reflected in the input setting screen, the meter only moves when it's overly loud
[06:46] <ese> hi, i got skype and ubuntu precise 32bits, in windows 7 runs good, am 100% sure am giving the right credentials but in ubuntu does not crash or anytrhing, it just hangs and does not login, i can login with my browser, any ideas?

[06:49] <ese> no, dual boot grub in win 7 and ubuntu precise 32bits

[06:52] <ese> usr13,  not in skype but in my browser am in, skype in my windows 7 partition logs in fine.

[06:54] <usr13> ese: http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/
[06:54] <ShapeShifter499> I have java 7 and 6 installed but only the java 6 plugin shows up in firefox, how do I get the java 7 plugin to work?   I run ubuntu 13.04 64bit
[06:55] <usr13> ese: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[06:55] <ese> http://community.skype.com/t5/Linux/Can-t-sign-in-Ubuntu-12-04/td-p/838226
[06:55] <ese> usr13,  yes my box is uptodate
[06:56] <usr13> ese: Did you rm ~/.Skype  ?
[06:56] <ese> usr13,  i was wonder if you guys come on with the solution, because i been googloing some time now, nothing i can found about it
[06:57] <ese> yes i try rm -rf .Skype and login with my hotmail and my skype accounts same problem
[06:57] <usr13> ese: hotmail?
[06:57] <usr13> ese: (I don't know about hotmail or what it has to do with skype.)
[06:58] <smaudet> ShapeShifter499: remove the java 6 plugin, or better yet, java 6 if you don't need it
[06:58] <ese> yes ...the new skype have two options, login with skype credentials or msn credentials, i choose both with no luck
[06:58] <smaudet> ShapeShifter499: otherwise make sure java 7 is default, with update-alternatives
[06:58] <usr13> ese: Sounds like skype is broken.
[06:58] <ese> usr13,  my msn is a hotmial account
[06:58] <usr13> ese: Yea, got it.
[06:59] <usr13> ese: Just sounds like skype is broken,  Maybe they will get around to fixing it sometime soon...
[06:59] <ese> usr13,  yes, looks like because i been looking for an answer but nothing so far
[06:59] <ShapeShifter499> smaudet, ohh I forgot about "update-alternatives", yea I need java 6 for some android stuff
[06:59] <sett> i had to remove pulseaudio and everything worked fine, today i wake up and it's installed again wtf
[06:59] <ese> one guy sugest running with root but i dont want to do that
[07:00] <usr13> ese: Try downloading from http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-linux-beta-ubuntu-32
[07:00] <usr13> ese: Re-install?
[07:00] <ese> usr13,  i may try running from root skype for testing, hmmm
[07:00] <usr13> ese: Really?  Why would you do that?
[07:01] <sett> what music player is most used now? any advice? just need names
[07:01] <usr13> ese: In other words, no, don't.
[07:01] <ese> usr13, one post suggest running from root, and looks like he run it ok, but i dont want to run skype with root
[07:01] <quick-> sett: Rythombox
[07:02] <quick-> sett banshee
[07:02] <usr13> ese: Yea.  Don't do it.
[07:05] <usr13> ese: My notion is this;  Microsoft will see that skype works ok on the Microsoft Windows platforms.  They will not worry so much about how it runs on Ubuntu. (Maybe if [Ubuntu] users want skype bad enough, they will convert to Microsoft platforms.) (I may be over critical, but just my notion.)
[07:05] <ese> usr13,  i installed skype-beta, am rebooting because i elso install something else thats is asking me to reboot, brb thanks
[07:05] <usr13> ese: Other than that, I'd say try uninstalling it and download directly from skype.com and re-install.

[08:00] <legend321> Is Medibuntu illegal to use? Lately i tried everything to eliminate static sounds coming out from ubuntu(including downloading ubuntu restricted extras), but it was of no use. Then i downloaded and installed some packages from medibuntu and it fixed my problem.
[08:01] <smaudet> legend321: legal gray area
[08:01] <cfhowlett> legend321, not illegal ....
[08:01] <smaudet> legend321: although there is plenty of non-gray stuff in medibuntu
[08:02] <ghost_> ubottu : I get the following output sorry, ubuntu 13.04 has experienced an internal error.if you notice further problems, try restarting the computer
[08:02] <ubottu> ghost_: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[08:02] <MindSpark> bibi32: what do you mean get the group? are you trying to setuid?
[08:02] <MindSpark> ghost_: when do you get this error?
[08:02] <MindSpark> this sounds like a windows error to me :P
[08:03] <smaudet> ghost_: that is the automated error management
[08:03] <legend321> smaudet: Is medibuntu officially supported by ubuntu?
[08:03] <roninn> where does 2>&1 go?
[08:03] <smaudet> smaudet: depends. I'm not official ubuntu, just a volunteer. Are volunteers official? Medibuntu is volunteer.
[08:03] <MindSpark> roninn: redirects stderr to stdout
[08:04] <legend321> ok
[08:04] <ghost_> MindSpark : every time I turn on the laptop
[08:04] <roninn> stdout is hmm where? :|
[08:04] <MindSpark> ghost_: which part? after booting?
[08:04] <MindSpark> ghost_:  or before loading the startup screen?
[08:04] <MindSpark> roninn: on your screen :)
[08:04] <smaudet> ghost_: if you want you should be able to choose a 'more details' option, and you should have some sort of error notification show up in your task bar
[08:05] <MindSpark> roninn:  http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/io-redirection.html
[08:05] <smaudet> ghost_: there is some program which is dying at every boot.

[08:06] <bibi32> MindSpark: I mean that when I create a file in a directory, it isn't owned by my group, but group of the parent directory
[08:06] <MindSpark> bibi32: then the setgid bit is set on the parent dir
[08:06] <ese> i found out that skype leaves a zombie process to PPid in init 1!  [skype] <defunct>   if belongs to init 1: cat /proc/22164/status | grep -i ppid -> PPid:	1  ...how can you kill a zombie with parent to init 1 without halting your box? i think this is a major bug for skype 32bits!

[08:07] <gordonjcp> oh, no factoid for that
[08:07] <bibi32> MindSpark: so this has nothing to do with umask?
[08:07] <ese> gordonjcp, yes, this flaw is big on skype
[08:08] <gordonjcp> ese: you could try contacting the authors, but it's unlikely they'll ever fix it
[08:08] <gordonjcp> ese: well the zombie processes don't really cause a problem as such
[08:08] <gordonjcp> ese: it's not the biggest problem Skype has
[08:08] <smaudet> ese: where bad program are concerned, contact authors. Where authors are unavailable, obtain source. Where source is unavaible, stop using that program.
[08:09] <nowayride> Pidgin really enjoys leaving zombies too
[08:09] <MindSpark> bibi32: not sure if you can set gid/uid using umask. But you just need to chmod u-s or chmod g-s on the parent dir
[08:09] <smaudet> And purge all copies of it from your hdd

[08:09] <MindSpark> bibi32: man chmod, then look up SETUID AND SETGID
[08:10] <smaudet> nowayride: last step, stop using Skype and use something else
[08:10] <nowayride> Probably the only legit step with SKype
[08:11] <smaudet> Its not anti-Microsoft, just anti-bad programs.

[08:29] <blazemore> lesser_panda: Sort of, but less clunky
[08:29] <bibi32> my umask is 0002, when I create a file it is 664, shouldn't this be 775?

[08:30] <smaudet> lesser_panda: xda forums seems to full of people who know android
[08:31] <MindSpark> ghost_: I recommend you delete the .cache dir in your homedir and login again
[08:32] <MindSpark> if this doesn't work, move the .config dir to something like .config-old and see if the error goes away, if it does, it's some misconfiguration
[08:32] <smaudet> MindSpark: I suppose, but there are literally hundreds of reasons it could be erroring
[08:32] <smaudet> You can't cover every case just because someone doesn't give more details.
[08:33] <smaudet> The best you can really say in that case is "re-install ubuntu"
[08:33] <MindSpark> smaudet: like you said, probably a config problem. But just to make sure it is, that's a quick and sloppy method to find out
[08:33] <smaudet> Which I do not recommend
[08:34] <smaudet> MindSpark: I've had very few problems with my .config files, maybe I'm just lucky
[08:34] <MindSpark> smaudet: there's no need to reinstall anything if X loads and he can log in and everything.
[08:34] <smaudet> usually when stuff goes kerplut a package maintainer did something stupid
[08:34] <smaudet> And the config is buried in the system somewhere, or there's another compatability
[08:34] <smaudet> compatability issue
[08:34] <smaudet> So yes, re-install is about the only pat-way of ensuring that 'out of the box' 'just works'
[08:35] <MindSpark> smaudet: this is a user specific configuration issue. I am almost sure if he uses a different user the error won't popup again.
[08:35] <smaudet> Since that's at least supposed to be QA'ed and working
[08:35] <smaudet> MindSpark: you don't even know that
[08:35] <smaudet> Its likely, yes
[08:35] <smaudet> But you could just be wasting his time and configuration
[08:35] <MindSpark> smaudet: we're trying to troubleshoot and think together here
[08:35] <cfhowlett> MindSpark, easily tested.  create a new user and see
[08:35] <ghost_> smaudet : yes that is my error, http://itsfoss.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screenshot-from-2013-03-26-205909.png
[08:35] <MindSpark> that's why I recommended to move the configuration to another name
[08:36] <smaudet> MindSpark: its not a bad suggestion, but its a rather drastic one
[08:36] <MindSpark> why drastic?
[08:36] <smaudet> Because it removes all your configuration? (most of it anyways)
[08:36] <MindSpark> you move your config dir into confi.old. If it doesn't work, you move it back and as if nothing happened
[08:36] <smaudet> You're throwing out the baby with the bathwater
[08:36] <MindSpark> huh?
[08:37] <smaudet> If he's made any changes
[08:37] <smaudet> he loses the good ones with the bad ones
[08:37] <timfrost> bibi32: For a umask of 002, a file with 664 is correct, because the EXEC bit isn't set by default
[08:37] <ghost_> MindSpark : how to delete cache in my homedir
[08:37] <MindSpark> smaudet: did you read what I suggested?
[08:37] <smaudet> And if he can't find the old config error, likelyhood is he won't know how to find the 'good' stuff
[08:37] <smaudet> even if he keeps a backup
[08:37] <smaudet> yes, you said to move to config.old and login again
[08:38] <MindSpark> smaudet: correct, that's 100% safe
[08:38] <smaudet> MindSpark: safe, but still overly destructive, IMHO
[08:38] <smaudet> for a new user at least
[08:38] <MindSpark> smaudet: not destructive at all
[08:38] <smaudet> ghost_: good, can you press 'Show Details' and tell us what it says?
[08:39] <smaudet> MindSpark: I only see it as non-destructive if you return .config.old to .config, in which case the problem is back.
[08:40] <smaudet> So I guess you know where the problem is or isn't at that point, but it doesn't solve the problem.
[08:40] <MindSpark> smaudet: exactly, and that is how I troubleshoot
[08:40] <MindSpark> smaudet: once you know where the problem is, you get into more details
[08:40] <MindSpark> that's how you pinpoint a problem
[08:40] <smaudet> MindSpark: great, but that's roundabout
[08:40] <smaudet> You need details to find a problem
[08:40] <MindSpark> is the problem in the interior, the motor or the chassis?
[08:41] <MindSpark> oh the motor? then which part of the motor
[08:41] <MindSpark> etc...
[08:41] <smaudet> That is one way to find a detail, but a not very efficient way
[08:41] <smaudet> imo
[08:41] <blazemore> Is it possible to pass a flag to ./configure to have that flag applied to all occurences of gcc? the flag in question is -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
[08:41] <ghost_> smaudet : please wait I'm restarting my system
[08:41] <MindSpark> smaudet: hmmm... interesting. So there is a definitve guide to fix problems?
[08:42] <smaudet> MindSpark: if your check engine light comes on, are you going to check the tires first? Of course not.
[08:42] <smaudet> You use the details the system gives you first
[08:42] <smaudet> Not ones you think might be the problem.
[08:42] <MindSpark> blazemore: depends on the configuration script I guess?
[08:42] <clue_h> i'd check the tires
[08:42] <clue_h> tyres
[08:42] <MindSpark> lol
[08:42] <smaudet> psh
[08:43] <MindSpark> blazemore:  you could just edit the ./configure script and hardcode the option inside
[08:43] <smaudet> MindSpark: and yes, actually, there is, its called Occam's Razor, and its the method I used to say config issues are the most likely
[08:44] <MindSpark> smaudet: I'll look that up, thanks, maybe I'll be able to prevent the next world war
[08:44] <smaudet> MindSpark: http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html
[08:45] <MindSpark> smaudet: reading on wikipedia, will read your link as soon as I am done, thanks!
[08:45] <MindSpark> hmm in fact, yours looks better
[08:46] <smaudet> In this case I'm saying the simpler method is just to hit 'Show Details' and see the problem report
[08:46] <timfrost> blazemore: many configure scripts pick up "CFLAGS' or similar environment variables and pass them to the make command.  Try 'CFLAGS=-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2'
[08:46] <smaudet> Not run 100 tests to find where the config issue is :P
[08:47] <MindSpark> smaudet: I never said he shouldn't open the logs. I also never suggested 100 test ;)
[08:47] <MindSpark> test
[08:47] <MindSpark> tests
[08:47] <smaudet> MindSpark: purposeful exaggeration to make a point ;)
=== GingerGeek[Away] is now known as GingerGeek
[08:48] <MindSpark> but I am assuming he will find a 0x4340873 memory overrun in the log which won't give enough info. Just me though, I never had apport or even X to begin with when I started my journey
[08:50] <smaudet> MindSpark: usually in my experience the apport logs are pretty nice
[08:50] <smaudet> I would recommend your approach on Windows since you do get more random error dumps of memory there ;)

[09:23] <ghost_> MindSpark : why.,?
[09:24] <MindSpark> ghost_: ok, this is a daemon error, not sure what bamf does, but you should start with googling something like "bamfdaemon crashed"
[09:24] <MindSpark> that's what I am doing right now
[09:26] <smaudet> ghost_: here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bamf/+bug/1063544
[09:26] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1063544 in bamf (Ubuntu) "bamfdaemon crashed with SIGSEGV in g_desktop_app_info_new()" [High,New]
[09:26] <ghost_> MindSpark : whether this has to do with compiz effect that I give.,?
[09:26] <MindSpark> ghost_: you need to know what is crashing first
[09:27] <MindSpark> http://askubuntu.com/questions/260734/what-does-bamfdaemon-do
[09:27] <MindSpark> again, I recommend you try to clear the cache folder as a start
[09:27] <MindSpark> open a terminal
[09:27] <MindSpark> type cd ~
[09:27] <MindSpark> then mv .cache .cache-old
[09:28] <ActionParsnip> MindSpark: 'cd'   on it's own goes to $HOME too :)
[09:28] <MindSpark> then logout and login again
[09:28] <MindSpark> ActionParsnip: yea :) I typed that at first
[09:28] <smaudet> ghost_: the link I sent you means your issue is known, current, and will be resolved ASAP
[09:29] <MindSpark> ghost_: or simply open your file manager locate the .cache file (you might need to reveal hidden files) and rename it to something else
[09:29] <ghost_> what should i do guys.,??
[09:30] <smaudet> ghost_: how much memory does your computer have?
[09:30] <MindSpark> yes it looks like a confirmed bug on launchpade
[09:30] <MindSpark> pad
[09:30] <qin> Problem with apt, output of apt-get instal -f and lsb_release -a; apparently there is some problem with libjack package. http://paste.ubuntu.com/6039694/
[09:30] <smaudet> This is a guess, but the crash reason is as stated in the bug report 'SegvReason: writing NULL VMA'
[09:31] <smaudet> Which means some memory access is failing, just a guess but perhaps you have very little memory
[09:32] <ghost_> smaudet : may be 320 GB, for ubuntu 32 GB
[09:32] <smaudet> VMA is a virtual memory location; I don't know anything about VMA but it sounds like 'extra' memory the linux system creates when it runs short
[09:32] <smaudet> ghost_: do you know the amount of RAM? Not hard drive space
[09:33] <smaudet> ghost_: how old is the computer?

[09:38] <smaudet> ghost_: that may be part of your problem then, those specs are a little low for ubuntu 13.04
[09:38] <smaudet> I'd recommend at least 2 GB ram
[09:39] <smaudet> I run 4 GB
[09:39] <karab44> hello
[09:39] <smaudet> ghost_: of course if it works for you and you are just getting an annoying popup, it might be worth your time just to not re-install
[09:40] <karab44> is there a friendly tool to check what modules has been installed on ubuntu desktop? I mean like deamons apache/php /posftix and other stuff like that
[09:40] <ikonia> karab44: dpkg -l
[09:40] <smaudet> ghost_: its not a serious issue though, its just annoying and you can ignore it, likely completely safely

[09:41] <christos_> i bought a wifi usb .. i have the cd drivers for linux but i cant install it and i want help ... i am using 12.04 lts
[09:41] <karab44> ikonia: thanks!
[09:41] <ikonia> christos_: ok, so ask what you need help with
[09:41] <smaudet> ghost_: ubuntu recommends 13.04 for 'new' computers
[09:41] <christos_> how can i install it
[09:41] <smaudet> 12.04 is what I run
[09:41] <smaudet> and is for older computers
[09:41] <ikonia> christos_: what does the documentation say ? are you sure you need to install it ?
[09:42] <ghost_> smaudet : owww., your computer is macintosh ?
[09:42] <smaudet> ghost_: nope, dell
[09:42] <christos_> ikonia: i am connenting usb with pc but cant do my to connect with wifi
[09:42] <ikonia> christos_: what does the documentation say ? are you sure you need to install it ?
[09:43] <christos_> ikonia:  yes bcs linux cant find it as wifi usb
[09:43] <ikonia> christos_: 1.) what does the documentation say 2.) because it can' find it out of the box doesn't mean you need to install anything (although it may)
[09:44] <karab44> by the way... ubuntu 12.04 desktop wont install on my PC. I have installed 1204LTS server but I want to overwrite it. I tried livecd, now liveusb hags on first ubuntu logo. Weird thing is that live cd works from USB, but won't install.
[09:44] <karab44> Oh! It just said Unable to find a medium containing a live file system.
[09:45] <smaudet> christos_: I'm not going to be around much longer
[09:45] <christos_> ikonia:  ok how can i know that isb is working correctly
[09:45] <christos_> ?
[09:45] <smaudet> but I'd look at the model, and see what drivers there are for it
[09:45] <ikonia> christos_: what does the documentation say about it
[09:45] <d3vZer0> hi all
[09:45] <christos_> ikonia:  what do you meann the read me file?
[09:45] <smaudet> christos_: if your wireless is working, you should see some wifi output from ifconfig
[09:45] <karab44> do I have to format my disk drive first?
[09:45] <smaudet> e.g. ifconfig | grep eth1
[09:46] <auronandace> ikonia: christos_  usb wifi is the ralink: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsVarious#USB
[09:46] <smaudet> christos_: did you have to install anything when you used it on windows?
[09:46] <christos_> ikonia:  i have done ifconfig and i have 3 parts 1.eth0  2. lo 3.wlan0
[09:46] <nerdtron> karab44 which disk drive? the internal drive where ubuntu server is installed? no you don't have to format it before booting
[09:46] <smaudet> christos_: its working then
[09:46] <smaudet> unless you have another wifi card
[09:46] <nerdtron> it will be formated when you install Ubuntu anyway
[09:46] <smaudet> wlan0 is your adaptor
[09:47] <smaudet> eth0 is probably your ethernet link
[09:47] <karab44> nerdtron: I have two disks one is SSD / and 2x WD 500GB RAID0
[09:47] <karab44> and I install on SSD, where is 1204LTS already
[09:47] <christos_> smaudet: for windows i have to and i neeed it for here i think
[09:47] <karab44> but I want to overwrite it.
[09:47] <smaudet> christos_: if its working, you should be able to see the wifi networks by opening the NetworkManager
[09:48] <karab44> and no menu appears, only ubuntu logo with dots changing color
[09:48] <nerdtron> karab44 when you choose erase everything and install ubuntu, the hard drive will be formated again
[09:48] <smaudet> christos_: well then it could be the wrong driver was selected for it
[09:48] <karab44> but no menu is shown, I have no choice
[09:48] <christos_> smaudet:  i cant find NetworkManager
[09:49] <smaudet> ikonia: what is NetworkManager called in gui land?
[09:49] <nerdtron> karab44 press the arrow keys up or down to see the text mode and post the last lines
[09:49] <smaudet> nm-applet is the package I believe
[09:49] <ikonia> gnome-network-manager
[09:49] <ikonia> it's part of the desktop
[09:49] <ikonia> smaudet: yes, thats the actual applet on screen
[09:49] <karab44> nerdtron: I have only choice Run Live system/ Install ubuntu so I choose install ant then nothing happens. Just logo and dots...
[09:50] <smaudet> christos_: following ikonia's suggestion, I'd look for gnome-network-manager
[09:50] <smaudet> if you don't see the network icon in the upper right corner
[09:50] <ikonia> shouldn't need to look for anything, it's already installed on the desktop
[09:50] <karab44> nerdtron: live system works fine. I boot from USB.
[09:50] <karab44> nerdtron: Ill try to get some logs
[09:51] <nerdtron> karab44 when you are in live mode, click the install option in the desktop
[09:51] <karab44> okay
[09:51] <christos_> smaudet: in the software ceneter i have downloaded the manager but in my pc i cant find it
[09:51] <amigo> guys, how to tell exim4 to send mail with full name sender? FROM: Jhon Doe <jhon@doe.com>
[09:52] <smaudet> christos_: well, assuming you manage to find the manager (there should be some icons in your menu bar, upper right)
[09:52] <smaudet> it could be that the wrong driver is installed, in that case you will have to find the right one, install, then sudo modprobe -r baddriver
[09:52] <smaudet> sudo modprobe gooddriver
[09:53] <smaudet> may need to restart NetworkManger e.g. sudo service network-manager restart
[09:53] <christos_> smaudet:  from where i can do wifi check
[09:53] <smaudet> http://s2.hubimg.com/u/2986461_f496.jpg
[09:54] <smaudet> If you can see in the upper right there is a small wifi icon
[09:54] <smaudet> next to the volume
[09:55] <smaudet> also check auronadace's link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsVarious#USB
[09:55] <smaudet> see if your card is in there or not, if it is install that driver
[09:56] <smaudet> And if that doesn't work you can try using fw-cutter
[09:56] <nl287> strange
[09:57] <nl287> Reading package lists... Error!
[09:57] <nl287> Segmentation fault
[09:57] <smaudet> Although that doesn't always work well, and I'm not ready to sit here debugging it the rest of the night
[09:57] <smaudet> christos_: good luck
[09:59] <karab44> nerdtron: I am processing installation, I will let you know is it succeed
[10:00] <karab44> nerdtron: and yes, through USB live mode
[10:01] <karab44> probably I know, what could be the problem. My bios beta makes USB stuff not always work. After boot/reboot they get big lag.
[10:01] <karab44> this is how it finish when you experiment with uefi
[10:01] <vice_> Hi! How can i do link open source in skype permanent? It always asks me, and theres no checkbox or smth
[10:02] <smaudet> !offtopic | vice_
[10:02] <ubottu> vice_: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[10:04] <nerdtron> karab44 maybe the "hang" state you get in the logo and the dots, you'll just have to wait a few minutes
[10:04] <nerdtron> sometimes it is very slow
[10:05] <smaudet> karab44: custom bios wat? I'd get rid of that beta bios if I were you.
[10:05] <nerdtron> karab44 I always turn off uefi,,,,,it doesn't bring anything except troubles :)
[10:06] <karab44> nerdtron: I did wait quite long and patient and I get "Unable to find a medium containing a live file system" message
[10:07] <karab44> but now it just started to work conditionless. First time with liveUSB, now installator shown on booting
[10:08] <karab44> smaudet: unfortunately, producer released beta - first uefi bios for my mobo.
[10:08] <nerdtron> you sure you "burned" the usb correctly? or rather is your ISO good? better try it other computers just to be sure
[10:08] <nerdtron> karab44 oh it started the installation?? let's wait for the result
[10:09] <karab44> I set time zones and other stuff, it didn't showup before.
[10:09] <karab44> So it should be fine now
[10:10] <qin> Problem with apt, output of apt-get instal -f and lsb_release -a; apparently there is some problem with libjack package. http://paste.ubuntu.com/6039694/
[10:11] <karab44> during the installation - is computer name a place where I set a full qualified domain name?
[10:11] <karab44> It is where I set name and username and passwords
[10:12] <christos_> anyone who know about bluetooth?
[10:12] <aeon-ltd> christos_: just ask the actual question anyway
[10:13] <Shootingiron> Hello, is there a free irc chat client with spell check available for ubuntu?
[10:13] <christos_> can i send a file via bluetooth with out the other device accept my request?
[10:13] <cfhowlett> christos_, pretty sure that the receiver has to verify permission
[10:13] <Shootingiron> christos: sounds suspicious. =)
[10:15] <nerdtron> karab44 yes computer name is the hostname only and not the FQDN, you can always change it after install
[10:16] <aeon-ltd> christos_: there are some devices i've used that can skip the verification for 'known' devices. why would you need this? if you own the device usb would be much faster and reliable
[10:16] <christos_> ok
[10:16] <karab44> nerdtron: you mean in these hosts and hostname files?
[10:16] <karab44> it shouldnt be a big problem
[10:16] <nerdtron> Shootingiron XChat spell checks while you are typing :)
[10:17] <karab44> Ok installation completed
[10:17] <nerdtron> karab44 yes, hosts and hostsname, don't forget to run sudo hostname restart and logout login to see changes
[10:17] <karab44> it boots in 3 seconds :)
[10:17] <karab44> 2,5 maybe
[10:17] <karab44> very fast
[10:17] <christos_> for ex. i want to send a message for my bday  .. and with request it will take more time so with out answer for myy request i will send my invitation .. can i?
[10:17] <Shootingiron> nerdtron: Thanks .. are some of these clients only available in certain desktop environments?
[10:17] <peppo> hi! how do I show my network mounts (NFS) in the left launcher panel? both of my currently mounted nfs shares were showing before, but now they're gone.
[10:18] <aeon-ltd> christos_: use bluetooth to send a message? seriously?
[10:18] <nerdtron> Shootingiron i'm using Xchat in Ubuntu and Xubuntu and KDE...all is well
[10:18] <christos_> its free !
[10:18] <nerdtron> christos_ but it is very short range
[10:18] <aeon-ltd> christos_: also limited to about 30 meters
[10:19] <christos_> its ok but can i?
[10:19] <Shootingiron> Nerdtron: very nice, thanks for your time. =)
[10:19] <karab44> okay, it works flowless
[10:19] <aeon-ltd> christos_: no the reciever needs to be set to auto accept
[10:19] <christos_> hmmm
[10:19] <aeon-ltd> christos_: you cannot forcibly push unlike radio broadcasting
[10:19] <nerdtron> peppo while you view the shared folder, create a book mark for it..what file manager are you using?
[10:20] <peppo> nerdtron, nautilus I guess. it wasn't a bookmark before and it still showed a network mount folder icon in the launcher panel
[10:20] <peppo> (the left thingy)
[10:20] <nerdtron> karab44 congrats..glad to hear that
[10:20] <christos_> hmm i heard that a friend did this  ...
[10:20] <karab44> okay, let's try something completely different. Is there a fast and nice way to make snapshots of this system to let's say another drive?
[10:21] <karab44> nerdtron: thank you. It's up to you :)
[10:21] <nerdtron> karab44 i have no idea.. it think similar to Mac time machine is "back in time"
[10:21] <karab44> I mean installation works thanks to you :)
[10:22] <aeon-ltd> christos_: you know how this looks right?
[10:22] <nerdtron> karab44 you're welcome....
[10:22] <christos_> wich ?
[10:22] <peppo> nerdtron, a bookmark how? there's no such context menu item
[10:22] <karab44> ok but I thing about like system image like snapshot in virtualbox.
[10:22] <aeon-ltd> christos_: what it sounds like you want to do
[10:22] <karab44> when something go terribly wrong I just summon good system.
[10:23] <nerdtron> peppo hmmm i think you should go up one folder up the directory, then drag the folder you want to the left pane
[10:23] <peppo> nerdtron, nope, it doesn't add it, it just shows that it can open the folder with nautilus
[10:23] <nerdtron> karab44 i don't think that exists yet in live systems...I believed the answer to that is Cclone your hard drive...
[10:23] <edheldil> Hi all, has anybody experienced a problem with timed waking up sleeping syscalls on precise? E.g. in iostat, there's { alarm(1); ... ; pause(); }, but the SIGALARM frequently comes after several (e.g. 5) seconds. Consequently, iostat sometimes waits much longer than expected between  outputs. Similar for ping, that does { setsockopt(fd, SO_RECVTIMEO, 1); recvmsg(fd); } - the EAGAIN comes not after 1sec, but sometimes after sever

[10:24] <nerdtron> peppo sorry..need to go ....
[10:24] <christos_> aeon-ltd:  i want to send invitation for my b-day to my friends via bluetooth but i dont want to answer me to my request for the msg bcs it will take more time..
[10:24] <karab44> nerdtron: it is a good point.
[10:24] <aeon-ltd> christos_: that sounds like a lie
[10:24] <karab44> I heard about clonezzila but I was just wondering is something build into ubuntu and I could for example make automated launch periodicly
[10:25] <peppo> anyone know how to force the unity launcher to start showing network mounts again?
[10:25] <christos_> aeon-ltd:  bluetooth msg are free if i start to call to all my friends i will waste my money
[10:25] <edheldil> I suspect that could be caused by dynamic ticks and AMD cpu, but so far disabling dynticks did not improve the scheduling
[10:25] <aeon-ltd> christos_: at <30 meters you could just ask them, or use paper
[10:26] <christos_> aeon-ltd:  its more action with mob ... where is the lie what can i send.. its not pc just a mob
[10:27] <aeon-ltd> christos_: if your friend did this then ask them, if you have 2 devices keep trying to do this, afaik it isn't possible without accepting a prior message then setting it to auto-accept future messages
[10:28] <christos_> aeon-ltd:  okk thanks its this that i want to hear :)

[10:51] <HypnotiX> how can i see why ubuntu takes 2-3mins to load after login ?
[10:52] <blazemore> HypnotiX: Does it do it for every user?
[10:52] <HypnotiX> im the only user
[10:52] <blazemore> Try the guest user
[10:53] <HypnotiX> ok brb
[10:54] <wanttolovedjango> How do I can install sqlite on ubuntu ?
[10:54] <aeon-ltd> wanttolovedjango: not in the repos?
[10:55] <wanttolovedjango> Is sqlite3 a gui for sqlite ?
[10:55] <nl287> wanttolovedjango: apt-cache search sqlite
[10:55] <HypnotiX> for guest its almost instant for my user its ~2mins
[10:56] <aeon-ltd> HypnotiX: what starts after login?
[10:56] <blazemore> OK HypnotiX on your user, take a look in the startup applications. disable them all, and renable them one by one until you find the one causing problems
[10:57] <HypnotiX> in the startup i have dropbox, chrome, and a bit of terminal code i run to remap a key for my mouse
[10:57] <blazemore> Which one of them is causing the delay?
[10:57] <HypnotiX> i will try now
[10:57] <jonascj> Hi all. Could somebody tell me having a LVM swap partition or having a swap file on a lvm partition is as good as a normal partition? I don't know the internal mechanics of LVM but having those very flexible volumes could suggest that the logical volumes (i.e. my swap partition) would not be contiguous on disk.
[10:57] <ikonia> jonascj: no different
[10:58] <HypnotiX> ok it was dropbox
[10:58] <HypnotiX> its instant without it
[10:58] <jonascj> ikonia: empirical fact or does LVM ensure contiguous partitions?
[10:58] <HypnotiX> sigh
[10:58] <alt^255> Hi. I'm installing ubuntu 12.04.1 and in the past hour I'm getting a signature mismatch with package libjs-json

[10:59] <blazemore> alt^255: have you tried running sudo apt-get update first?
[10:59] <wanttolovedjango> Where is the place of sqlite file on ubuntu ?
[10:59] <ikonia> jonascj: it should order data from the VG against PE block sizes per LV,
[10:59] <alt^255> blazemore: yes, several times. It all worked in the last install, an hour ago.

[11:00] <HypnotiX> blazemore: thanx
[11:00] <alt^255> blazemore: I'd rather not run custom scripts if possible. apt-get -u dist-upgrade forced the install and things are OK now, I'm just paranoid.
[11:00] <jonascj> ikonia: okay thanks, i'll take your word for it and read up on LVM another day :)
[11:00] <blazemore> alt^255: Take a look at what it does
[11:00] <wanttolovedjango> can anyone help
[11:02] <alt^255> blazemore: I see. I guess I'm not the first to ask such questions ;)
[11:03] <jonascj> uh, one last: swap file vs. swap partition. Any good points? They perform the same as far as I can read, but any manageability arguments?
[11:03] <blazemore> alt^255: It's a nuclear approach (those commands) - but it does sort out nearly all packaging problems
[11:03] <blazemore> jonascj: Not much to consider in terms of performance - up to you whether you find it easier to manage
[11:03] <alt^255> blazemore: I understand. Still I wonder what happened in the past hour..? Except the NSA doing runtime data injection to read all my mail.. oh, no, wait..
[11:03] <alt^255> thanks.
[11:05] <jonascj> blazemore: I was just looking for arguments like: "you can live resize your swap file but not a regular partition"
[11:07] <jonascj> blazemore: but perhaps there are none. I'll give it a good chance that the only manageability differences are the tools you use, resize2fs vs dd and so on.

[11:31] <jackson_> hello!
[11:37] <support_> I need help in solving some right access problem. I formatted my external hdd (2 Tb) in ext4, now I can't copy anything there and so on without having sudo rights. How can I change that?
[11:40] <CatKiller> support_: sudo chown -R username:username /mnt/MyHardDrive
[11:40] <CatKiller> where "username" is your own
[11:40] <support_> and if I'll reconnect it to other PC?
[11:41] <CatKiller> support_: Other Linux running machine?
[11:41] <support_> yes
[11:41] <support_> with other user as default
[11:41] <CatKiller> support_: Well then the userid might not match and you may not access it ok
[11:41] <CatKiller> support_: The problem sharing filesystems
[11:41] <CatKiller> support_: A solution is to simply create a common group on both nodes
[11:41] <CatKiller> a group that has the same group id
[11:42] <CatKiller> and add both users to that group
[11:42] <CatKiller> and change the mode to username:groupname
[11:42] <CatKiller> and make sure you also "chmod -R g+w /mnt/myHardDrive"
[11:42] <CatKiller> that will ensure that both users have access to it
[11:43] <support_> I think I tried chown... but I'll try again
[11:43] <support_> I also set 666 right recursively is it correct?
[11:43] <karab44> ubuntu does not mount my raid drive. It says there is no partition table. What partition table do I have to create as I want to format it later use for NTFS partition?
[11:44] <CatKiller> support_: It's overkill
[11:44] <karab44> there are some options like msdos
[11:44] <support_> ?
[11:44] <CatKiller> support_: This will solve your problem and is the right way to do
[11:44] <CatKiller> http://superuser.com/questions/175987/how-can-i-automatically-set-write-permissions-on-mounting-a-usb-drive-in-linux
[11:44] <wanttolovedjango> How do I can change my ssh password ?
[11:45] <support_> well It didn't, the problem I described occured after I made that
