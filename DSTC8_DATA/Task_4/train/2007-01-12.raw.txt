[09:21] <bakert> JoshJ - can bg be called with a process id or something like that???
[09:21] <FactTech> Flannel OK, so basically the "saved session" is the equivalent of the "startup" folder in Windows.
[09:22] <bakert> JoshJ i'll check the man page
[09:22] <JoshJ> hm
[09:22] <JoshJ> dunno
[09:22] <JoshJ> man bg gets no results for me
[09:22] <JoshJ> so lemme just test that

[09:30] <Flannel> JoshJ: no, you shouldn't do that even.
[09:30] <mnoir> bjames: putty supports scp.  for more fun, install cygwin on yer windows box to turn it into a fake unix box
[09:30] <foobarian> JoshJ, given a process P, 'kill -STOP P; kill -CONT P' then killing the controlling terminal leaves the process running in the background.
[09:30] <tim167> I have /media/cdrom-1, which contains the Edgy Alternate install cd, and I tried /cdrom-1 too
[09:30] <Flannel> JoshJ: sudo -i is the correct method
[09:30] <JoshJ> ah, right
[09:31] <tim167> JoshJ: i mean gksu "sh /cdrom-1/cdromupgrade"
[09:31] <stefg> MerlynC: you have to investigate which modules are actually loaded (lsmod) and compare that to a list of modules which are known to be needed. More time-consuming tahn i can spend ATM
