[05:00] <robertj> aha!
[05:00] <robertj> one last problem with my laptop
[05:00] <farruinn> ssh is already installed
[05:00] <bascule> ubuntu2u: friendly word, if you can't work out how to install it, stay awy from it for a bit, you have all the entertainment you need on that ubuntu machine
[05:00] <robertj> if I put my laptop to sleep, the only button which will wake it is the power button'
=== shad0w1e [~stjrox@ool-182ede79.dyn.optonline.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[05:00] <shad0w1e> well I finally tried out fluxbox like everyone said i should....
[05:00] <robertj> and that causes the machine to shut down ;)
[05:00] <shad0w1e> and I think it should come built into every distro of linux
[05:00] <bascule> learn how to use the shell, all telnet will do is get you another one, it *so* old that you'll get trouble all the time with it
[05:00] <Pluk> robertj, you have fglrx installed?
=== marcin_ant [~marcin@www.e-dev.tele2.pl]  has joined #ubuntu
[05:01] <shad0w1e> nope
[05:01] <shad0w1e> its installed, but no 3d
[05:01] <GammaRay> fluxbox.. yawn
[05:01] <plagerism> thats strange, gedit uses the gnome-print stuff which works with cups, why doesnt abiword use this gui as well??
[05:01] <shad0w1e> well it sucks
[05:01] <shad0w1e> but it should still come build into every distro
[05:01] <lavigj> farruinn: shoot... I don't think that even has it
[05:01] <ubuntu2u> bascule, i dunno i read some article about port surfing and it said to do this and it is legal... i dunno lol
[05:01] <robertj> Pluk: what's that?
[05:01] <Pluk> the ati 3d driver
[05:01] <shad0w1e> like solaris comes with openwin
[05:01] <GammaRay> shad0w1e: why is that?
[05:01] <mpq> will I have to restart to upgrade to hoary?
[05:01] <shad0w1e> because its like 100KB window system
[05:02] <shad0w1e> with the basic: a window system
[05:02] <GammaRay> shad0w1e: icewm would be a betetr choice
[05:02] <bascule> port sufring with telnet i old news, it just raises alarms and gets you in trouble
[05:02] <robertj> Pluk: this is an nvidia laptop
[05:02] <farruinn> lavigj: that sucks :/
[05:02] <robertj> err adapater
[05:02] <GammaRay> shad0w1e: it's lighter than flux
[05:02] <|QuaD|> once hula includes ical, it is going to be awesome
[05:02] <shad0w1e> it's good to have when everything else is dead
[05:02] <farruinn> shad0w1e: I concur, fluxbox rox
[05:02] <Pluk> maybe nvidia;s 3d is bugging acpi too
[05:02] <shad0w1e> fluxbox can't rock
[05:02] <shad0w1e> its a window system
[05:02] <shad0w1e> thats it
[05:02] <bascule> although it is leagal, it is an unfriendly gesture, like walking about a night with a torch looking in windows
[05:02] <lavigj> farruinn: yeah..... I think I need greater than 1.2.8 for ffmpeg
[05:02] <marcin_ant> hi
[05:02] <shad0w1e> It's good to have, but not to use
[05:02] <robertj> Pluk: it works
=== mre [~mre@user-10cm8i3.cable.mindspring.com]  has joined #ubuntu
[05:03] <robertj> its just that pressing the power button signals it to shut down
[05:03] <Pluk> cuz i had the same problem sleep and 3d didnt work at the same time
[05:03] <marcin_ant> does ubuntu use ~/.bash_profile ?
[05:03] <robertj> but my laptop wont wake the machine unless the power button is pressed
[05:03] <farruinn> shad0w1e: whatever, I used to use it all the time
[05:03] <Pluk> same here robertj
[05:03] <GammaRay> and I actually kinda enjoy using icewm :-P
[05:03] <stuNNed> jdub: i mean to burn mpg/ogg/flac to cd as cd tracks
[05:03] <shad0w1e> I'm considdering changing distros to get my stupid fglrx working, unless someone's got some newer tips....
[05:03] <mre> Having a problem with CUPS.  Anyone knowledgable about security issues?
[05:03] <Pluk> only diff is that ia have an ati card
[05:03] <LinuxJones> marcin_ant, yes
[05:03] <marcin_ant> I switched from fedora but I would like to delete this file from ~/
[05:03] <lavigj> farruinn: actually... what the heck. it is saying that it needs Depends: libsdl1.2debian (>1.2.7+1.2.8) but 1.2.7-7 is to be installed, but the only thing like that is cvs...

[05:04] <lavigj> farruinn: maybe this will do it - I think I found a less cutting edge one available
[05:04] <LinuxJones> marcin_ant, what are you trying to do ?
[05:04] <mre> Trying to get past the default CUPS installation security.
[05:04] <ubuntu2u> linuxjones, i want to use telnet for port surfing cuz i read an atricle on it. how do i get net send to work?
[05:04] <mre> Anyone know what user to use?
[05:04] <Pluk> mre, adduser cupsys shadow
[05:05] <stuNNed>  /win 10
[05:05] <marcin_ant> LinuxJones: hmm I just have for example JAVA_HOME in this file
[05:05] <lavigj> farruinn: bingo
[05:05] <stuNNed> oops
[05:05] <mre> cupsys already exists

[05:05] <Pluk> you want to login to localhost:631 right?
[05:05] <shad0w1e> I meant a menu that I can add shortcuts onto, heh heh
[05:05] <mre> yes
[05:05] <marcin_ant> LinuxJones: but I don't have JAVA_HOME in export's output
[05:05] <GammaRay> shad0w1e: edit the file :-P
[05:05] <Pluk> then you have to add cupsys to the shadow group

[05:05] <marcin_ant> LinuxJones: and this is why I wonder if ubuntu uses file
[05:05] <farruinn> shad0w1e: go read the fluxbos website or something
[05:06] <shad0w1e> andalso get rid of that stupid thing on top of all the windows. i hate that thing
[05:06] <Pluk> that way cupsys can check the password and allows login
[05:06] <mpq> will I have to restart the computer once I'm done downloading the hoary upgrade?
[05:06] <LinuxJones> ubuntu2u, don't use telnet use ssh, search gogle for it there are thousands of how-to's for Linux + ssh
[05:06] <shad0w1e> hmm prob a good idea
[05:06] <mre> let me see if there's a group 'shadow'

[05:08] <mre> Beats me.  I just want a printer to work.
[05:08] <marcin_ant> LinuxJones: JAVA_HOME?
[05:08] <stuNNed> shad0w1e: lol
[05:08] <robertj> Pluk: Bug # 6625
[05:08] <Pluk> after that you need to restart cupsys through /etc/init.d/cupsys restart

[05:08] <ubuntu2u> linuxjones, is ssh already downloaded and i just need to install it using terminal or do i have to download it?
[05:08] <buckminst> Ok. Can anyone lend me some advice? During the ubuntu base installation, every time the installer hits a certain point, my laptop just shuts off. no warning, no apparant reason. I'm using an array 4 hoary CD image from the URL in the topic. Any clues?
[05:08] <ramb0> why does ubuntue never prompt me for a root password on install?
[05:09] <MacPlusG3> ramb0: RTFM
[05:09] <mre> user cupsys is now in groups dialout, lp and shadow.  Authrorization still fails.
[05:09] <trans_err> ramb0: because there is none
[05:09] <stuNNed> ramb0: cuz root account is disabled by default, it uses sudo instead, if you want a root account afaik after you log in you sudo passwd
[05:09] <trans_err> MacPlusG3: be kind
[05:09] <Amaranth> ramb0: http://ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RootSudo
[05:09] <Amaranth> we really need a bot
[05:09] <billytwowilly> ever since I upgraded the kernel a couple days ago my laptop has started spinning down the hard drives while plugged in leading to irritating freeze times while it spins up again. How do I fix this?
[05:09] <khaled> yes
[05:09] <LinuxJones> ubuntu2u, >> http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/SSHHowto
[05:09] <khaled> specially for that question
[05:09] <Amaranth> so i could do `root or something and have the bot spit that out
[05:09] <mre> I haven't restarted yet.  I will.
[05:10] <Pluk> after that you need to restart cupsys through /etc/init.d/cupsys restart
[05:10] <MacPlusG3> trans_err: when things are in the FAQ... and *easily* findable in the FAQ
[05:10] <ramb0> stunned: that is clever, why is that?
[05:10] <Amaranth> that and ndiswrapper
[05:10] <shad0w1e> okay I'm gonna go give fluxbox a second shot before opening my mouth
[05:10] <shad0w1e> I'm gonna make it look like the pics on the website
[05:10] <trans_err> MacPlusG3: we may have inhereted a lot of debian, but no need to inheret the attitude
[05:10] <khaled> Amaranth: you have the link to ndiswrapper ?
[05:10] <stuNNed> ramb0: because it's basically a bad idea to use the root account directly, it's too dangerous.
[05:10] <ramb0> o
[05:10] <shad0w1e> u know i got ndiswrapper working without any trouble at all

[05:11] <stuNNed> ramb0: use sudo it will prompt you for your user password or you can create a root account if you wish, but it's not ubuntu policy, at least current, afaik
[05:11] <Amaranth> khaled: Yeah, but I have to google that one. :P
[05:11] <shad0w1e> i created an ubuntu root acount
[05:11] <shad0w1e> just type in
[05:11] <Amaranth> khaled: It's the first result for "ndiswrapper ubuntu" in google.
[05:11] <shad0w1e> sudo passwd root
[05:11] <shad0w1e> then su to switch into root
[05:11] <stuNNed> think just sudo passwd will do it no?

[05:14] <billytwowilly> what is SHA-1 used for?
[05:14] <Pluk> marcin_ant, never ssh as root
[05:14] <Pluk> just ssh as user the su there
[05:14] <marcin_ant> Pluk: on _localhost_
[05:14] <stuNNed> farruinn: so i take it the reason k3b-setup can be dangerous when run with sudo is what it creates in home?
[05:15] <Pluk> ah soz
[05:15] <marcin_ant> Pluk: I want to use "tramp" package in emacs
[05:15] <farruinn> stuNNed: oh, well for gui apps it's usually better to use gksudo or kdesudo (or whatever the kde equivalent is)
[05:15] <trans_err> stuNNed: you have to run k3bsetup2 as root
[05:16] <marcin_ant> Pluk: and open files owned by root with C-x C-f /root@localhost:/etc/fstab (for example)
[05:16] <marcin_ant> Pluk: is this possible when there is no root account?
[05:16] <farruinn> sudo emacs ?
[05:16] <Pluk> hmm dunno
[05:16] <Pluk> 1st thing i always do is enable root account :P
[05:16] <marcin_ant> farruinn: I don't want to fire another instance of emacs
[05:17] <marcin_ant> farruinn: I just want to open single file - as root
[05:17] <farruinn> hm, dunno then.  maybe ask in #emacs?
[05:18] <marcin_ant> farruinn: heh and you propably know their answer
[05:18] <marcin_ant> farruinn: "don't use rootless distro" :)
[05:19] <farruinn> hm, I see
[05:19] <farruinn> you could request a solution on the ubuntu devel mailing list I suppose
[05:19] <jesuel> no root account?

[05:21] <jesuel> thats the first thing i did when i installed ubuntu

[05:21] <farruinn> root isn't disabled, there just ins't a password
[05:21] <marcin_ant> jesuel: but there is no way to ssh to this account on ubuntu
[05:21] <jesuel> marcin_ant, do you have a user account on the system?
[05:21] <marcin_ant> jesuel: user? soure
[05:22] <marcin_ant> s/soure/sure
[05:22] <GammaRay> well root is overrated.. have never missed using it
[05:22] <ubuntu2u> farriunn, hey umm i installed an ssh server how the heck do i use it? i want to be able to telnet to other computation devications
[05:22] <jesuel> so just ssh to the user account and then sudo emacs wheverfile
[05:22] <marcin_ant> jesuel: I don't want to do this
[05:22] <mre> ssh requires a username as well as a host
[05:23] <jesuel> you could enable root to ssh in
[05:23] <jesuel> but i wouldnt do that ;p
[05:23] <farruinn> ubuntu2u: go read some documentation, you don't need a server on your machine to access other computers
[05:23] <mre> e.g., bohunk@xyz.com
[05:23] <marcin_ant> jesuel: because I have my own configuration for emacs as user in  ~/.emacs
[05:23] <|QuaD|> so have you guys seen hula?
[05:23] <mre> that is ssh bohunk@xyz.com
[05:23] <regeya> ?
[05:23] <|QuaD|> ?
[05:24] <regeya> what's hula
[05:24] <marcin_ant> jesuel: and another thing is that when I'll forget that this emacs session is sudo session
[05:24] <ubuntu2u> farriunn shut the hell up! *proceeds to jump off building in monkey suit with cape on* you will never stop me! BTW do i need to have ssh installed on another computer i want to remotely log onto?
[05:24] <|QuaD|> new novell open source project
[05:24] <|QuaD|> was /.'ed earlier

[05:31] <trans_err> tux_: just built it-- no normal crashes yet
[05:31] <shad0w1e> hey does anyone want to give me a crash course on flux?
[05:31] <mpq> what the hell just happened?
[05:32] <trans_err> shad0w1e: right click
[05:32] <regeya> marcin_ant: I guess you failed to notice the lack of 'Ubuntu Developer' nametag on my shirt
[05:32] <tux_> trans_err, maybe that was the problem
[05:32] <shad0w1e> I'm not that bad
[05:32] <jesuel> lol regeya
[05:32] <shad0w1e> i got X-chat open
[05:32] <mpq> I just upgraded to hoary... I think... and everything on the toolbars is gone
[05:32] <tux_> ah, nice
[05:32] <trans_err> tux_: i just rolled up a deb if you want to try her out
[05:32] <tux_> ok
[05:32] <mpq> it said the "trash applet" crashed and now there's nothing else on the toolbar
[05:32] <shad0w1e> but I got a theme : how to install?
[05:32] <tux_> i will build it
[05:32] <marcin_ant> regeya: sorry I just wanted to know if I really need root password to use tramp - nothing more
[05:33] <trans_err> tux_: make sure to grab the xinerama-devs -- for some reason it fails the build if you dont have them
[05:33] <regeya> marcin_ant: I wish I knew what the logic of not setting a root password is, but I don't.  So, my suggestion would be to set a root password, run emacs sudo, or run off and investigate how to get tramp to do what you want to do because not only do I not know, I don't need to know how to do what you want to do.
[05:33] <mpq> you have to be kidding me

[06:50] <delltony> the winedebuger comes up but unfortunately for me i hve no idea how to understand it :(

[06:51] <delltony> i tried that and really didn't like it

[07:04] <ImagistTD>  I had an error when the boot disk was "Loading components of the Ubuntu Installer". Everything goes fine until it comes to "Retrieving nic-extra-modules-2.6.8.1-3-386-di". Then the screen flickers (looks like an infinite loop)
[07:04] <mpq> I think I read somewhere that it would be read-only
[07:04] <diego> mpq: do something like `mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/point/
[07:04] <mpq> if so, it wouldn't help me
[07:04] <diego> mpq: oh...
[07:05] <mpq> I can't install the sims 2 outside of windows
[07:05] <mpq> and I can't run it from the partition in hoary
[07:05] <ImagistTD> I'm running on a Dell Inspiron 1100, Pentium 4, version A06 chipset
[07:05] <diego> mpq: yeah, if you want stable read&write support between win&lin, i think fat is the way to go
[07:05] <mpq> which would require that I uninstall windows
[07:05] <SiRrUs> anyway good night everyone
[07:05] <Mr_Smiley> you can read ntfs partitions fine, just not write
[07:06] <diego> mpq: no..windows comes with an ntfs->fat32 conversion utility i think
[07:06] <mpq> really?
[07:06] <delltony> it does?
[07:06] <mpq> I thought it was only the other way
=== K-Rich [~krich@216-190-167-148.bras01.sho.az.frontiernet.net]  has left #ubuntu []
[07:06] <diego> hehe, i think it does both
[07:06] <delltony> i don't think it is i think its only one way honestly
[07:06] <diego> i'll boot and check if you'll see if .pdf attachments work for you...deal?
[07:06] <mpq> windows doesn't like fat
[07:06] <mpq> so I don't see why it would
[07:07] <heydude> hey- will the live CD - run the same as a normal install- i wanna see how fast the os works
[07:07] <mpq> it won't be as fast as the install
[07:07] <heydude> k
[07:07] <diego> heydude: negative, reading off a cd is much slower than reading off a hd
[07:07] <mpq> because it will be limited by cd read speed
[07:07] <heydude> ok
[07:07] <diego> mpq: deal?
[07:08] <mpq> huh?
[07:08] <diego> if you'll check if .pdf file uploads (such as in a html-based e-mail attachment), i will look for that ntfs->fat32 tool
[07:08] <zenrox> delltony,  it does work bolth ways
[07:09] <mpq> if I convert NTFS to FAT32 will it destroy the data?
[07:09] <diego> preferable
[07:09] <diego> **cough** i mean no
[07:09] <mpq> if I had a choice I wouldn't have windows at all
[07:10] <mpq> but my sister is addicted to the sims 2 and my computer is the only one in the house that can handle it
[07:10] <heydude> can someone help me partition a drive
[07:10] <heydude> im trying to have a dual boot- windows/linux - i dunno what the hell im doing
[07:10] <ImagistTD> I'm going to try something from the documentation again
[07:10] <diego> will someone check the reproducibility pdf attachment issue i'm having (posted in detail 7-8 minutes ago), please?
[07:10] <ImagistTD> I may know what I did wrong
[07:10] <delltony> where in xp? cause i tried it before i know partition magic 8 will do it

[07:11] <heydude> no

=== delltony boots up vmware with xp so i can look at this ntfs conversion you talk about if thats ok
[07:11] <mpq> you downloaded partition magic?
[07:11] <heydude> something like that
[07:12] <mpq> are you sure it's partition magic?

[07:13] <heydude> i downloaded a zip file online with some things
[07:13] <heydude> is there another program i can use
[07:13] <heydude> an open source one?
[07:13] <mpq> partition magic is retail
[07:13] <sulkd> mpq, you don't want fat32.. believe me... fat32 has a 4gig filesize cap
[07:13] <heydude> k
[07:13] <tux_> qtparted on knoppix
[07:13] <tux_> works good
[07:13] <diego> come on, no one in here is nice enough to check if a .pdf http upload works for them on hoary?

[07:14] <mpq> what about fat?
[07:14] <sulkd> ?
[07:14] <delltony> that is true too what sulkd  said
[07:14] <mpq> is there a cap on FAT?
[07:14] <tux_> fat is very limited...
[07:14] <tux_> that is why ms uses ntfs now
[07:15] <mpq> I can't use NTFS outside of windows
[07:15] <tux_> right
[07:15] <delltony> if you have two boxes you can
[07:15] <mpq> I don't have two boxes
[07:15] <linux101> ms should switch to rieserFS
[07:15] <delltony> you can samba into it
[07:15] <sulkd> mpq, yeah.. each file can only be 4 gigabyte... which doesnt suit me since I have some dvdr images
[07:15] <mpq> each file?
[07:15] <tux_> and using ext3 in windows is not really working .. except for reading
[07:15] <mpq> I thought you meant the entire partition
[07:16] <sulkd> mpq, well you can read ntfs just fine..
[07:16] <diego> tux_: ext3 in windows? how?
[07:16] <mpq> but I can't write to it
[07:16] <mpq> which doesn't help
[07:16] <sulkd> mpq, maybe what you need is a flash unit for carrying files between linux and windows
[07:16] <mpq> I have that
[07:16] <mpq> but that's not the point
[07:16] <sulkd> ok
[07:16] <tux_> diego, there is an opensource app called explorerext2 or some such
[07:16] <sulkd> yeah
[07:16] <mpq> the problem is that the I only have windows to run the sims 2
[07:16] <diego> tux_: cool, i'll have to check that out sometime
[07:16] <sulkd> the flash things suck anyway, I think they even are fat formatted
[07:16] <delltony> he is wanting to dual boot windows linux if i understand him right
[07:16] <mpq> if I could run it in linux I could uninstall windows
[07:16] <mpq> but I can't
[07:16] <tux_> diego, handy tool
[07:17] <delltony> mpq then in that cause use that free vmware qeum i thnk it is
[07:17] <tux_> mpq, why uninstall windows...
[07:17] <delltony> case even
[07:17] <mpq> I can't
[07:17] <tux_> just delete the partition
[07:17] <tux_> or rather format it
[07:17] <mpq> if I uninstall windows I can't run games
[07:17] <tux_> lol
[07:17] <zenrox> mpq, i have many games installed
[07:17] <mpq> my sister is addicted to the sims 2 and my computer is the only one that can run it
[07:17] <linux101> thats why i keep windows for the games
[07:18] <delltony> dude like i stated run that vmware program that is the free one i forget the name someone can help me with that
[07:18] <tux_> mpq, that is why i have another system .. just for windows crap... got the system from the dumpster
[07:18] <sulkd> oh come on, we all know that if you want to run games it's best to just use windows and not even bother with cedega..
[07:18] <delltony> but i use vmware personally to play games and what have you
[07:18] <mpq> I can't afford another box
[07:18] <tux_> delltony, i think qemu will do that for you
[07:18] <mpq> if I could I sure wouldn't dual boot
[07:18] <delltony> yeah thats it
[07:18] <delltony> thanks for the name
[07:18] <sulkd> delltony, run games in a windows that is run over an emulator?
[07:18] <tux_> mpq, nice to hear
[07:18] <delltony> yeah i run windows xp full install in vmware
[07:18] <delltony> and the games work fine
[07:19] <sulkd> mpq, can you afford another hdd ?
[07:19] <delltony> haven't tested all games
[07:19] <mpq> no

[07:19] <diego> hi all. i know this SOUNDS stupid but it's what i'm experiencing and is 100% reproducible on my machine. any .pdf i upload becomes corrupt. checked this with attachments on gmail and hotmail. jpg attachment worked fine. i'm on hoary. would someone else be kind enough to see if it's just me? this is important to me as i got a 0 on an assignment i spent 5 hours doing yesterday because i couldn't print it.
[07:20] <mpq> I guess you'd be pretty sure that I'm not in the area
[07:20] <delltony> haha thats a sure way to get no help :)

[07:22] <delltony> diego dcc it to me or whatever

[07:22] <GregoryD> zip your file, unzip on other end
[07:22] <diego> GregoryD: the zipping worked for me...jpg's worked. but why does this happen?
[07:23] <sulkd> diego, bummer..
[07:23] <GregoryD> if it's only a pdf and no other binary, then you shouldn't have a problem ;)
[07:23] <delltony> i thought i read somethign about corruption in open office on the forums
[07:23] <delltony> but i think it was doc files though
[07:23] <diego> i can open the .pdf on my hard drive before sending fine
[07:23] <sulkd> diego, could be some ascii transfer mode shit.. but I kind of doubt it over HTTP
[07:23] <diego> i send it, and it only uploads a portion of the pdf
[07:23] <sulkd> oh
[07:24] <linux101> where do i run make menuconfig in ubuntu?

[07:43] <Dreamer3> |QuaD|: yeah
[07:43] <|QuaD|> it is giving me uninstalled packages too :(
[07:43] <ficusplanet> OmniColos: No.  I'm on a Dell, unfortunately.
[07:43] <ficusplanet> OmniColos: But NetworkManager rocks.
[07:43] <Jeremy_D> i am downloading theme files, how do i install them, i have tried to use the theme installer, but it doesnt seem to be working
[07:44] <|QuaD|> dpkg -l is showing me all packages
[07:44] <Jeremy_D> i am trying to install it by clicking on the XML file, but that doesnt work, theres nothing else to use to install it
[07:44] <lucid> well, I've been a windows user forever
[07:44] <mpq> I've been a windows user until less than two weeks ago
[07:44] <Jeremy_D> why mpq?
[07:44] <lucid> i dabble with linux now and again being a web developer
[07:45] <lucid> but that's about it
[07:45] <Jeremy_D> yeah me as well
[07:45] <mpq> why? Because I installed ubuntu?
[07:45] <OmniColos> I was gonna ask a 1394 question... I got raw1394 running with the mknod hack but it is very sluggish getting dv

[07:45] <OmniColos> and the output is unreadable
[07:45] <DeepSpaceAnt> heydude, 1/2 the time when im away from my comp and i come back, i come back to see that my comp is frozen, what logs do i see to find out whats causing the freezing?

[07:46] <ficusplanet> OmniColos: It's just bulky, ugly, and loud.
[07:46] <mpq> linux is neat
[07:46] <_LC_> hi all
[07:46] <lucid> i love the default theme
[07:47] <mpq> a lot faster than the resource hog that is windoze
[07:47] <jesuel> OoOo,
[07:47] <Jeremy_D> i love kde's default theme
[07:47] <DeepSpaceAnt> heydude, 1/2 the time when im away from my comp and i come back, i come back to see that my comp is frozen, what logs do i see to find out whats causing the freezing?
[07:47] <OmniColos> welll it seems linux perks up any machine :D
[07:47] <Jeremy_D> much more customization
[07:47] <lucid> my friend has been pimping ubuntu for ages, finally got a CD off him
[07:47] <qlo-xael> i have a question and a problem, my question is can i get back to real console mode?
[07:47] <mpq> once I can get my old computer to turn on, I'm going to install ubuntu on it
[07:47] <OmniColos> I'm just happy I dont need osx
[07:47] <qlo-xael> i cant seem to get out of X
[07:47] <lucid> OmniColos, you're running it on ppc?
[07:47] <snowblink> qlo-xael: CTRL+ALT+F1
[07:48] <Jeremy_D> os x is awesome :)
[07:48] <OmniColos> yeah on an ibook 700mhz
[07:48] <Jeremy_D> i am a windows, linux, os x user :)
[07:48] <qlo-xael> thanks, second, when i installed it, i dont remember ubuntu asking for a root password
[07:48] <Jeremy_D> same with some distributions of linux
[07:48] <OmniColos> awsome OSX may be but I am not at home on it
[07:48] <snowblink> qlo-xael: root is locked. Use sudo
[07:48] <lucid> how do i get out of gnome/x so i can install this stupid thing vmware needs?
[07:48] <_LC_> Can anyone help me with an installation problem? Have installed & re-installed quite a few times - whenever I reboot, the machine hangs on the "GRUB loading, please wait..." msg?
[07:49] <ficusplanet> OmniColos: So ubuntu seems to work well on that iBook?  How about suspend and such?  I ask because I have a friend with the same machine.
[07:49] <lucid> can i kill -9 gnome?
[07:49] <Jeremy_D> wow this is a bit hectic, there needs to be different rooms for all this lol
[07:49] <DeepSpaceAnt> heydude, 1/2 the time when im away from my comp and i come back, i come back to see that my comp is frozen, what logs do i see to find out whats causing the freezing?
[07:49] <OmniColos> suspend is wierd... I am still playing with it... and I think I messed up installing powerfrefs :D
[07:49] <ficusplanet> lucid: Just do ctrl+alt+f3 and then telinit 3 to kill x

[07:55] <OmniColos> no UDMA
[07:55] <Jeremy_D> ficusplanet, I mean it makes me feel much more comfortable with linux, knowing that there is help and a bit of thought put into the ease of use.

[08:00] <qlo-xael> how generally successful is a new kernel install in ubuntu?
[08:00] <OC_Linux> if ubuntu recognizes the 3c940 on my p4 box I'll be very happy
[08:00] <qlo-xael> i mean is it easy
[08:00] <snowblink> qlo-xael: are you building or using apt?
[08:00] <mpq> ubuntu was the first one I successfully ran
[08:00] <da_bon_bon> why doesnt hoary update to OOo 1.1.4 ?
[08:00] <myzt1qu3> hello????
[08:01] <mpq> I tried using knoppix but I didn't know how to burn an image
[08:01] <da_bon_bon> myzt1qu3: what help ?
[08:01] <myzt1qu3> i cannot even startx
[08:01] <qlo-xael> i just compiled 2.6.10 for slackware not too long ago and it seemed to work fine, only my man pages broke
[08:01] <qlo-xael> now i'm considering compiling in ubuntu, just curious how reliable
[08:01] <qlo-xael> maybe i shoudl try aptget or dselect?
[08:02] <OC_Linux> I was not able to comlplete the gentoo install and I had the mandrake boot problem on this ibook...
[08:02] <stuNNed> is gamin fubared when it comes to NFS?
[08:02] <snowblink> qlo-xael: thought you may be refering to the latest security updated kernel
[08:02] <OC_Linux> so I tried Gnoppix live and that worked great, found out it was based on Ubuntu, so that was my next stop
[08:03] <OC_Linux> and it installed like melted butter on toast
[08:03] <OC_Linux> synaptic is incredible...
