[21:52] <inashdeen> neersighted : thanx, at least that program indicate to me that i am running openjdk 7, which is good enough for me :)
[21:52] <Lunar_Lander> I read about that in the Malwarebytes forum
[21:52] <neersighted> it works if i 777 my .Xauthority
[21:52] <neersighted> inashdeen, np :)
[21:53] <Lunar_Lander> so this seems to be normal for Skype to use the client's PCs?

[21:59] <neersighted> lol tab complete
[21:59] <neersighted> lololol
[22:00] <escott> neersighted, well generally you want the Xauth to have 600, and stuff in /tmp should also be 600, unless you want it to be publicly accessible. I still want to know what this .z folder is?
[22:00] <WLU> how can I tell the commands to things that are in system settings in 11.10 i.e display which used to be gnome-display-properties but is no longer true
[22:00] <neersighted> Am i right that you just need to pass the text paramater to the kerenel to get the CLI?
[22:00] <neersighted> escott, .z is a small cache file used by vcprompt
[22:00] <neersighted> aparently
[22:01] <neersighted> it only does that moving spam when you are in a git/hg/bzr/cvs/svn dir tho
[22:01] <neersighted> <3 git

[22:03] <neersighted> yep
[22:03] <neersighted> Oneric
[22:03] <neersighted> Ohh ik what i did
[22:04] <neersighted> the .Xauth is part of the X server
[22:04] <neersighted> and i was making a alias called lightdm to do "startx lightdm"
[22:04] <neersighted> for when i booted in cli but wanted X
[22:04] <neersighted> must have messed up my X files
[22:04] <neersighted> hmmm
[22:04] <neersighted> Seems to work now
[22:04] <Lunar_Lander> does your K3b also freeze when finalizing a disc?
[22:04] <escott> neersighted, you should do a service lightdm start not startx
[22:05] <neersighted> okay

[22:05] <Lunar_Lander> xD but I like the sounds
[22:05] <escott> Lunar_Lamp, finalizing disks is a common place where burning breaks. you can use wodim and tell it not to finalize
[22:05] <neersighted> 1633 nicks?
[22:05] <Lunar_Lander> ah OK
[22:05] <neersighted> My irssi nick bar blew up

[22:14] <neersighted> thats the idea

[22:14] <neersighted> so its text?

[22:23] <Lunar_Lander> does someone use arduino too?

[22:26] <Diranged> nevermind, nscd was installed (ugh). uninstalled, made life happy
[22:27] <escott> neersighted, like what are its contents? its contents are an MIT-Magic cookie. ie a random string. before drawing a window the X server verifies that the client meets some restrictions, and has the proper magic cookie for that screen. this prevents a random user from popping windows up on a screen used by another person in a multi-user system
[22:27] <neersighted> oic
[22:27] <escott> neersighted, you can logout of X and then delete the file, and it should be regenerated

[22:32] <neersighted> i dont want to have to manually change it every update-grub
[22:32] <escott> neersighted, since you are using burg I dont know. if you were using grub it would be a change to the line in /etc/default/grub and then run update-grub
[22:32] <neersighted> grub is the seame
[22:32] <neersighted> *burg is the same
[22:32] <neersighted> its virtually identical

[22:33] <neersighted> ie
[22:33] <neersighted> Ubuntu, Ubuntu recovory, Ubuntu cli, and Windoze
[22:33] <escott> neersighted, so look at /etc/grub.d those scripts generate the options. you could add one that inserts text but copies everything else

[22:34] <neersighted> it looks like a shell script

[22:39] <medotyou> I'm new to linux but loving it tremendously!\
[22:39] <medotyou> learning about using dig to query name servers
[22:40] <lifebird> nice! personally, I'm scratching my head over the new 'dash' in version 11.10
[22:40] <Bilange> i believe that my routing for a ubuntu box is broken-- i can connect (HTTP/SSH) to that box but no TCP replies is sent back to the client. where/what would I need to check from that point? anything I could try to reset?
[22:40] <demosfar> hi...i have 2 problems....first is that my wireless broadcom 43227 don't work on my new lubuntu 11.10...any idea how to solv that?
[22:40] <escott> neersighted, actually a better way to do this is to emulate the other calls to "linux_entry" see the lines that say linux_entry ${OS} ${version} true \ single nomodeset ${GRUB_CMDLINE__LINUX}
[22:41] <neersighted> ?
[22:41] <Benkinooby> demosfar, first try is jockey-gtk
[22:41] <neersighted> line 147?
[22:41] <demosfar> and 2nd problem is about bluetooth...how can i see if i have bluetooth adapter or not? //i am not that big noob, but i don't have it in windows 7, but when lubuntu is starting, i see 'start bluetooth - ok'...
[22:42] <neersighted> could you give me a version with a third menu enrty?
[22:42] <demosfar> i already tried with broadcom STA drivers...didn't work
[22:42] <neersighted> is that what you mean?
[22:42] <lifebird> Bilange: what exactly are you trying to do? run a http server (and ssh server)?
[22:42] <wmoss> Hi all. I'm trying to install ubuntu on my MBA, and following the tutorial on help.ubuntu.com. The problem is that when I try to boot from the USB stick, my screen just shows "Boot Error." Anyone seen that before? Or know how to get it to boot?
[22:42] <Benkinooby> demosfar, the STA driver should do the trick.. did you reboot?
[22:42] <escott> neersighted, its in a couple places. linux_entry is a function that makes an entry, so you can just call it but with text ${GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}
[22:42] <neersighted> O_o
[22:42] <neersighted> I don't get what you mean
[22:43] <demosfar> yes...
[22:43] <demosfar> Benkinooby, yes i did
[22:43] <neersighted> is there already a function to get a cli?
[22:43] <neersighted> i just need to call it?
[22:43] <Bilange> lifebird: yeah, apache2 and sshd with pretty much defaults settings, bar some vhosts on the apache2 aprt
[22:43] <Bilange> part*
[22:43] <neersighted> escott: Could you help me make it?
[22:43]  * neersighted is so confus
[22:43] <escott> neersighted, so line 231,232,233 makes the normal entry
[22:43] <Benkinooby> demosfar, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
[22:44] <neersighted> 231?
[22:44] <neersighted> There is no 231?
[22:44] <escott> neersighted, so just change that around to say "text" before "quiet" on line 233
[22:44] <neersighted> kk
[22:44] <demosfar> Benkinooby, I read all that and did everything what's wrote there..but still no help..
[22:44] <escott> neersighted, my file may be different from yours
[22:45] <lifebird> Bilange: sounds like an issue with 'listen' directive or firewall to me. have you verified that the services are working locally? (ie. on the local host)?
[22:45] <Benkinooby> demosfar, then i'm out of advice... sorry :(
[22:45] <neersighted> http://pastie.org/2982983
[22:45] <neersighted> that's mine
[22:45] <neersighted> can i just add a third menu option?
[22:46] <demosfar> Benkinooby, ok...thnx anyway
[22:46] <Bilange> lifebird: confirming HTTP is listening and replying over 127.0.0.1, and i can also ssh 127.0.0.1-- to my knowledge (I didnt build the box), this one shouldnt have a firewall built in however
[22:47] <Bilange> lifebird: or rather, no "installed" firewall in other words
[22:47] <neersighted> oh i have a idea
[22:47] <neersighted> escott: let me pastie it quick
[22:49] <lifebird> Bilange: I'm guessing this is all going through a LAN, but using a home-based router (eg. D-Link/Linksys)
[22:49] <demosfar> how to check if my laptop has bluetooth adapter?
[22:49] <mosx1> hi, will a newly installed ubuntu server respond to ping  from another machine on lan ?
[22:50] <mosx1> or should it rather? it isn't currently though i can pick out from the server.
[22:50] <Bilange> lifebird: actually no (and this is where its slighty complicated): eth0 on LAN, eth1 on WAN (static IP given by the ISP), LAN has also its IP statically given
[22:52] <lifebird> Bilange: ah... so you're using NAT on the same box that's serving http and ssh. /now/ it's getting a little more involved. I'm at a loss at this point, but shooting in the dark, I'd examine your ipnat and ipf config
[22:52] <totesmuhgoats> so if i do apt-get update; apt-get upgrade, it should fetch all the packages that the update notifier tells me about right?
[22:53] <escott> totesmuhgoats, usually. it will notify you if there are some upgrades it cannot do right now
[22:53] <Bilange> lifebird: actually, i didnt need NAT on that setup (net.ipv4.ip_forward=0 here), i would only need http and ssh to behave normally on both adapters
[22:53] <totesmuhgoats> escott: ah, i was just wondering because the notifier popped up the other day after i had done it a few minutes before and apt-get showed no updates. I guess the notifier was just working off of old information
[22:54] <lifebird> Bilange: I'm drawing a blank at this point then, sorry. :(
[22:54] <Bilange> lifebird: no worries :)

[23:19] <neersighted> http://pastie.org/2983121
[23:19] <SlowBait> hi, i have the 32-bit version and i need the 64-bit one
[23:19] <neersighted> can anyone checdk this?
[23:19] <mdel> can I redirect the exit code for a command?
[23:19] <SlowBait> is there any way to do it without a CD?
[23:19] <neersighted> mdel
[23:19] <neersighted> yes
[23:19] <ikonia> tsvenson: the racks package ?
[23:19] <neersighted> $? is the exit code of the last command
[23:19] <ikonia> SlowBait: you need to re-install
[23:19] <JokesOnYou77> Hi all.  Is there a way to log and then graph system /hardware performance on my Ubuntu server so that I can view it later/remotely?
[23:19] <mdel> my usecase: im trying to run a command like "cd /path && killall -q proc && do other stuff"
[23:20] <mdel> i don't care if nothing was killed though, and I want other stuff to run

[23:20] <ikonia> SlowBait: you need to download the 64bit installer
[23:20] <escott> neersighted, so that looks like it would create a valid menuentry, but it would make more sense to run it and then look at the generated file
[23:20] <tsvenson> ikonia: I suppose. The current one is v1.1.0, but Redmine 1.2.x needs v1.1.1.

[23:37] <neersighted> Trying to add a CLI version
[23:37] <JokesOnYou77> Hi all.  I'm running a remote server for downloading large files and torrents, and after setting up the transmission Web UI and starting a large download I've lost the ability to connect to the server.  This has happened before with the connection restored once the download was complete.  What I want to know is if this was because of bandwidth or RAM
[23:37] <escott> Jordan_U, as long as he creates a new file that isn't in the apt why should it be a problem
[23:38] <neersighted> Jordan_U: Do i get any advantage if X starts at boot or can i say "screw it," and start CLI by default, and start X with service lightdm start
[23:38] <escott> Jordan_U, seems that copying 10_linux to 11_linux_cli would be the appropriate way to deal with this
[23:38] <ikonia> JokesOnYou77: you won't know until you can get onto the machine to check
[23:39] <neersighted> there, fresh 11_linux
[23:39] <ikonia> JokesOnYou77: I suspect it will be bandwidth eating your network and ssh responding too slow to login
[23:39]  * neersighted makes is 11_linux-cli
[23:39] <ikonia> ok, can we give the /me command a rest place
[23:39] <ikonia> don't need a running commentory
[23:39] <joli> hi
[23:39] <neersighted> okay?
[23:40] <neersighted> ...
[23:40] <joli> is it normal for xorg server to run as root?
[23:40] <Jordan_U> escott: Because 10_linux depends on functions in grub-mkconfig_lib whose semantics may change, and any mistake can break kernel updates even without that.
[23:41] <neersighted> escott: I'm not changeing 10_linux
[23:41] <neersighted> *Jordan_U
[23:41] <escott> Jordan_U, well thats pretty much true of hooking into anything in /etc. for all we know /etc/default/grub might be completely replaced tomorrow
[23:41] <neersighted> I'm using it as a base, but hardcoding all but kernel version
[23:41] <neersighted> Burg FTW!
[23:41] <JokesOnYou77> ikonia: Ok, that was my suspicion as well.  But this didn't happen when I didn't have the web UI stuff set up. I'll try capping the bandwidth at a lower speed and see if that helps.  I'm trying to figure out if I need to upgrade the RAM since it has less than 1G. But maybe it's just the bandwidth
[23:42] <JokesOnYou77> neersighted: Agreed, I love Burg

[00:28] <blabface> I think I use that...
[00:28] <blabface> I planned to use that to get round my works silly vpn
[00:28] <mbeierl> blabface: yes.  and you can change it to listen to localhost only
[00:29]  * blabface stops dnsmasq
[00:29] <mbeierl> blabface: should you so desire to do so that is.  edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf and look for the "interfaces" line.  iirc?
[00:29] <blabface> ok, looks like my ports are secure
[00:30] <anonymous44> anyone know how to get back the gnome3 panels in ubuntu 11.10; they keep crashing everytime I restart ubuntu, running gnome3 classic, no effects (no unity)
[00:30] <mbeierl> blabface: there is also a useful set of checks that you can run periodically to make sure nothing is awry with your system.  rkhunter is a good example.
[00:30] <blabface> I didn't update to 8.10 cus I didn't have space, but recently I baught a flash disk the size of ... well, it's small, and it's got more space than my whole box!
[00:30] <mbeierl> blabface: (root kit hunter = rkhunter)
[00:30] <mbeierl> blabface: sorry I was wrong.  8.04 is the LTS.  8.10 is not
[00:30] <blabface> it wants me to try 10.04.3 LTS
[00:30] <mbeierl> blabface: stay there, or go to 10.04
[00:31] <mbeierl> blabface: 10.04 is another stable release, but it is new, etc, and there are changes.  however, you will need to move off 8.04 at some point when it goes EOL
=== root is now known as Guest17523
[00:32] <blabface> mbeierl: cool, I thought it was EOL
[00:32] <mbeierl> blabface: I am wrong again.  8.04 IS eol: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
[00:32] <mbeierl> blabface: it went EOL back in May of this year.
[00:32] <anonymous44> blabface: you can downgrade to 8.04 server for it to still be supported

[00:33]  * blabface hunts for the interfaces line in dnsmasq.conf
[00:33] <blabface> is it bind-interfaces
[00:33] <blabface> hahaha
[00:33] <blabface> thought so
[00:33] <blabface> chrome of all things bitches every time it starts about 'your os is out of date'
[00:33] <blabface> but other than that, it's all good
[00:33] <FloodBot1> blabface: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[00:33] <mbeierl> anonymous44: if you start them from a terminal with "gnome-panel" after they crash, does it give any meaningful output?
[00:34] <blabface> FloodBot1: are you reading my eloquence or what?
[00:34] <anonymous44> mbeierl: `menu_proxy_module_load': gnome-panel: undefined symbol: menu_proxy_module_load
[00:34] <mbeierl> blabface: it's all good until a security vulnerability is found in one of the packages you run or so...  Chances of that being serious are small, but still....
[00:34] <blabface> mbeierl: yeah... I have the space to upgrade now
[00:34] <blabface> I should give it a try
[00:35] <mbeierl> anonymous44: hmmm.  google is not being helpful on that one tonight.  give me a little more time to do some reading and i'll see what comes up
[00:36] <mbeierl> blabface: you can always download it to a USB and play with it until you are comfortable.
[00:36] <anonymous44> mbeierl: thanks. that started it up, have a feeling gnome3 is not quite stable yet.
[00:37] <bastidrazor> anonymous44: what changes did you make before the issue began?
[00:37] <mbeierl> blabface: what I also do is create a second root partition and alternate OS versions on that: /ver1 /home /ver2 and depending on which I feel like using I boot using /ver1 as / or /ver2 as /
[00:37] <blabface> mbeierl: http://wiki.debian.org/HowTo/dnsmasq <- I don't see how dnsmasq listen to localhost only
[00:37] <mbeierl> anonymous44: so they run even though that output is present.
[00:37] <anonymous44> bastidrazor: I moved the taskbar to the bottom so there was only one, added default things like clock, menu, icons, etc. then the HD crashed, maybe due to ethernet/wireless driver or encryption
[00:37] <blabface> mbeierl: I'll try the usb thing... I'm short of disk
[00:38] <mbeierl> blabface: interface=lo
[00:38] <anonymous44> bastidrazor: a scan of the HD displayed no bad sectors (from a live disk)
[00:38] <mbeierl> blabface: and the 8.04 to 10.04 should be a smooth upgrade.  it will be the most tested upgrade path of them all
[00:38] <mbeierl> blabface: once you decide to bite the bullet that is

[00:39] <wayne87ae> ##hardware
[00:39] <blabface> mbeierl: I set that line, then restarted dnsmasq, then ran nmap, and the port still seems open, but then again, I guess I'm localhost
[00:39] <mbeierl> blabface: the netstat -napt will still show dnsmasq listening, but it will read "127.0.0.1:53" instead of 0.0.0.0:53
[00:40] <mbeierl> blabface: or *:53
[00:40] <mbeierl> blabface: and that would be netstat -napu not -t.
[00:40] <blabface> tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:53              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -
[00:40] <mbeierl> blabface: service dnsmasq restart?
[00:41] <blabface> stop and then start, so yeah
[00:41] <blabface> (no 'service' on this box ;-)
[00:41] <mbeierl> blabface: give me a moment to check on something...

[00:42] <hassan_> hello, I'm using ubuntu 11.10 and I'm trying to install a webcam server. I found the package webcam-server but it's not working with ubuntu 11.10. Any other suggestions? thanks
[00:42] <mbeierl> blabface: maybe this instead: listen-address=127.0.0.1
[00:43] <blabface> same
[00:43] <jtruant> is there an autostart file, or a config somewhere I can edit? (to disable compiz loading at boot)
[00:43] <Num83rGuy> Could anyone help me connect my desktop to my wifes laptop with samba? It works on fresh installs but, stops working after a while for unknown reasons.
[00:43] <mbeierl> blabface: iirc, while it is bound to *, it drops all packets coming in from the interfaces it is told to ignore...
[00:44] <blabface> so unless i scan with a differnt box, it'll appear open?
[00:44] <pharr> action parsnip available?
[00:44] <mbeierl> blabface: that is what the "bind-interfaces" directive is for.  You want to uncomment that line if you want it to bind to 127.0.0.1 only
[00:45] <mattheas> I have a multiport nic card and it's now renamed 3 of my four ports to eth#_rename after I did a reinstallation. I'm running 10.04 and I previously had a NIC bond. I need help ASAP as I'm deploying to afghanistan soon!

=== pharr is now known as x999
[00:45] <mbeierl> blabface: I knew there was another knob for that
[00:45] <blabface> mbeierl: works
[00:45] <mbeierl> blabface: dnsmasq is an old favourite of mine, but i don't have it installed here yet
[00:46] <blabface> interface=lo also works when bind-interfaces is uncommented
[00:46] <mbeierl> blabface: yes, it would.  that is the purposed of the bind-interfaces directive
[00:46] <blabface> mbeierl: yeah, I wanted to use it so I could still watch youtube while on the office vpn ;-)
[00:46] <blabface> mbeierl: cool, thanks for help
[00:46] <mbeierl> blabface: wait... say that again?
[00:47] <mbeierl> blabface: i am concerned you might not be doing what you think you are
[00:47] <mattheas> this is a disaster man
[00:47] <mbeierl> blabface: with the vpn.  do they refuse to serve a DNS address, or do they track your web usage?  Just having a local DNS server might not be enough.

[00:47] <blabface> mbeierl: office uses cisco vpn that sends all trafic via the tun by default. Currently I know I'm not configuring that, I'm just locking down the dnsmasq daemon
[00:47] <jtruant> I can't kill compiz w/o it coming back right away, back at 99% CPU usage..

[00:48] <blabface> mbeierl: not sure, either way, youtube causes the vpnc daemon to die in a nasty way
[00:48] <blabface> could even be an issue with my router (this is over wireless)
[00:48] <mbeierl> blabface: dnsmasq will still forward its requests to your office VPN.  what you want is a concept called split tunnel.  your cicso vpn may be configured by IT policy to disallow split tunnel\
[00:48] <blabface> I found the wireless network 'dies' when I watch youtube while 'running' the vpn
[00:48] <maum> I got [[Trying modes for CRT 345. CRT345 trying mode 3840x1080@50 Hz with output at 1920x1080@50Hz(pass 0)]] do you know any idea about this?
[00:49] <mbeierl> blabface: I currently use the vpnc cicso client and am able to do a split tunnel.  which vpn software are you using
[00:49] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: i have seen that weird occurrence. can you share your bonding configuration?
[00:49] <blabface> mbeierl: oh, I thought I could use dnsmasq to send certain packets (such as internet) to a differnt 'interface' instead of sending everything to the tun
[00:49] <mbeierl> blabface: no.  that won't do it, sorry.
[00:50] <blabface> the one in the repo (not the cisco one)
[00:50] <mattheas> SolarisBoy: The bond no longer even exists, I did a reinstall
[00:50] <blabface> oic
[00:50] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: is udev running?
[00:50] <mbeierl> blabface: that is vpnc.  did you use the Network Manager GUI to configure it?
[00:50] <blabface> I have no idea about network stuff tbh, and I don't work there any more
[00:50] <mbeierl> blabface: oh . ok.  right.  this is a leftover.
[00:50] <blabface> mbeierl: no, I couldn't get network manager to work, so I used the pcf2conf and run it on the cli

[00:52] <neersighted> *distro
[00:52] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: yes this seems to be the case where you just need to go ahead and give udev the proper rules for each interface.. for instance check the startup messages from when each nic boots.. and see the mac it is given,, than cross compare with ifconfig once boot up is done,, than hard code the udev rules for the macs
[00:52] <jtruant> depends on what you mean as well x999

[00:54] <bradhe> how does one go about installing a specific version of a package with apt? for instance, I want to install nginx 1.1.4 (specifically 1.1.4)
[00:55] <pp7_> bradhe: download the deb
[00:55] <bradhe> pp7_: will it overwrite the already-installed package (originally installed with apt)?
[00:55] <ks07> Parted is complaining that "The resulting partition is not properly aligned for best performance." How can I find out what values to use to properly align it?
[00:55] <mbeierl> bradhe: it can be done through the package manager, where you can lock the version you want.  gimme a sec
[00:55] <pp7_> bradhe: should do
[00:56] <pp7_> bradhe: u might have to uninstall first

[01:21] <noth> SMJ: sudo ldconfig -v
[01:21] <mattheas> SolarisBoy: I'm not seeing anything on it. However, I can change the macs using # ifconfig ethX hw ether YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY
[01:21] <mattheas> SolarisBoy: then rename them using 70-persistent-rules?
[01:21] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: are you going to use a fake mac for the interface with the duplicate which you do not know the proper mac name for?
[01:21] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: if so yes you can try that
[01:22] <mattheas> yes
[01:22] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: have you tried breaking the bond and bringing the interfaces up individually?
[01:22] <mattheas> SolarisBoy: since I reinstalled the bond shouldn't be active anymore, correct?
[01:22] <josePhoenix> Hello all
[01:22] <SolarisBoy> ohh ok my bad you did a reinstall..
[01:22] <josePhoenix> I'm getting issues with apport 1.23-0ubuntu4.
[01:22] <mattheas> SolarisBoy: Yeah, that bond no longer exists
[01:23] <josePhoenix> Some pre-start script exits with status 1 after installing
[01:23] <SolarisBoy> are you sure the driver is properly installed?
[01:23] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: i was under the impression you were already bonded
[01:23] <josePhoenix> Anyone know why this could be? It's behaving a lot like https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apport/+bug/767498 , but obviously with a different package.
[01:23] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 767498 in apport (Ubuntu Natty) "package apport 1.20.1-0ubuntu3 failed to install/upgrade: subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1" [Critical,Fix released]
[01:23] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: does it use some special driver? like one thats not available in the standard kernel?
[01:24] <mattheas> SolarisBoy: Negative, I don't even know that a bond will work with identical macs
[01:24] <SolarisBoy> you dont specify macs technically in a bond
[01:24] <SMJ> noth: that's more useful
[01:24] <mattheas> SolarisBoy: True, we could try rebonding and seeing if 802.3ad will work
[01:24] <mattheas> SolarisBoy: r8168-8, not special at all
[01:24] <SMJ> piping to 'grep /' is more readable though
[01:25] <norton> Hello newbie here , I love ubuntu but have an nfs issue not sure if this the correct forum to post a question  ??
[01:25] <SolarisBoy> the bond wont work if its reading identical macs though...
[01:25] <noth> SMJ : if you dont have sudo permission, you have to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
[01:25] <mattheas> SolarisBoy: So, shall I create a fake mac?
[01:25] <SMJ> I have
[01:26] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: try it
[01:26] <mattheas> SolarisBoy: scratch that, 3 of my ports are using the same mac now. this is trash.
[01:26] <SolarisBoy> i can't confirm it will work or not
[01:26] <SMJ> noth: which end of that list is the preferred one?
[01:27] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: can you send over your configs/relevant log message/ifconfig/arp -an/ip link sh/as much network related detail you can  in pastebin?
[01:27] <SolarisBoy> mattheas: include lspci -vvv also please
[01:27] <SolarisBoy> or lshw -C network
[01:27] <noth> SMJ: sorry that I can understand you mean.
[01:27] <SMJ> actually I just want to get /usr/local/ libraries preferred over the ones in /usr/
[01:28] <mattheas> wow, without a gui I don't think I know how
[01:29] <SolarisBoy> lynx http://www.anildewani.com/pastebin-com-bash-script-paste-directly-from-your-terminal/
[01:29] <noth> SMJ : sudo ldconfig -v | grep "/usr/local/libraries"
[01:29] <the20yrlaptop> What would cause ubuntu to run slowly on a USB persistent install? My laptop is newer and i always had great luck with it before

[01:37] <JokesOnYou77> tbruff13: Although I'm not a sysadmin or anything of the sort, I would say that most organizations that are doing large rollouts prefer the LTS versions because they will be supported for a long time to come (10.04 will be supported till 2015)

But if this is a large system the best thing to do is do a test upgrade in a virtual box before a major upgrade

[02:30] <brightspark> hatch, try setting the alsamixer controls to just above the minimum and see if that helps.  The main adjustment only works correctly if the different channels in alsamixer are set properly.

[02:40] <ubottu> sidney: Forgot your password? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal. Sudo doesn't ask for your password? It remembers you for several minutes. Please use strong passwords, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StrongPasswords
[02:40] <MahaVishnu> norton, something like this in /etc/fstab 192.168.100.85:/home/myself   /mnt/test  nfs  users,noauto,rw   0   0    also make sure you have portmap and nfs-common

[02:42] <superlou> Has anyone else had stability problems with flash over the last week?  It's worked solid for a few years for me, and a few months on 11.10, but it's been crashing on flash videos and sites very often recently.
[02:42] <KFP> superlou: Not me.   For me it's actually been working better recently than before.
[02:43] <MahaVishnu> superlou, pastebin this for me? lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'
[02:43] <superlou> MahaVishnu, doing so...
[02:43] <krispaul> Hello

[02:44] <superlou> MahaVishnu, http://pastebin.com/BSwzphHU
[02:44] <norton> Maha:  that fstab is run on the server side correct?
[02:44] <asiri> how ca i use gtalk

[02:45] <superlou> KFP, i probably got lucky and hit an edge case
[02:45] <haylo> thanks linux admins for helping the world not suck :) you guys rule !!
[02:45] <krispaul> Is there a reason why when i power of bluetooth is enable again after powercycle?
[02:45] <MahaVishnu> superlou, sudo dpkg -P flashplugin-downloader:i386
[02:45] <krispaul> I mean i dont dislike bluetooth but i dont get the idea of getting it on by default
[02:45] <sajuukkhar> guys what driver do I use for the Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller?
[02:45] <krispaul> !help blutooth
[02:45] <krispaul> !help bluetooth
[02:45] <sajuukkhar> I really have no idea
[02:45] <superlou> MahaVishnu, even though i'm on x64?
[02:46] <sajuukkhar> I had it working on 10.10 but 11.10 broke it
[02:46] <MahaVishnu> superlou, thats the old i386 version. you have the x86_64 stuff installed, we aren't touching those.
[02:47] <superlou> MahaVishnu, ok.  Command done.  Ah, P = purge?
[02:47] <MahaVishnu> superlou, yea.
[02:47] <superlou> should i try restarting browser?
[02:47] <MahaVishnu> superlou, yea can't hurt. now your on same flash as me.
[02:47] <aruncn1> My memory car is not detected by ubuntu. I have locked the card using my nokia phone and lost the password. How can i format and use the card?
[02:49] <MahaVishnu> superlou, what are you using firefox ?
[02:49] <sPrinGfield> aruncn1 use fdisk /dev/sdXYZ
=== dkg is now known as danielkg
[02:49] <brightspark> aruncn1, how have you tried to get ubuntu to recognize the card?
[02:49] <sajuukkhar> anyone know how to change video graphics drivers?
[02:49] <superlou> MahaVishnu, well, so far no crashes yet, but it can be kinda sporadic.  I typically use Chrome, but I had used a firefox plugin to try the i386 version in compatability mode previously
