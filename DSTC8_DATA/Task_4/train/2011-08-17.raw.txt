[03:59] <bennis> is there a way to access the 'system' menu with the keyboard in gnome?
[03:59] <atdprhs> but I can't add the unallocated resources to /
[03:59] <atdprhs> what do I do?
[03:59] <escott> bennis, windows key then type system
[03:59] <bennis> thank you!
[03:59] <bennis> um
[03:59] <bennis> windows key doesn't doanything?
[04:00] <escott> atdprhs, you have to boot the system in a livecd and then grow the partition
[04:00] <atdprhs> I am on livecd
[04:00] <escott> bennis,  is this classic gnome? maybe the "menu" key (the one on the other side)
[04:01] <jmcantrell> should i use ext2 or ext3 for a large external drive?
[04:01] <bennis> escott: the munu key just does a right click basically
[04:01] <escott> jmcantrell, ext4 is probably best
[04:01] <theadmin> jmcantrell: ext2 has no journal thus will wear the drive out less
[04:01] <jmcantrell> ok. so ext2 or ext4?
[04:02] <atdprhs> escott, I'm trying to grow / partition with more space by taking 1 GB from 2 GB swap
[04:02] <atdprhs> it seems that swap is in an extended partition
[04:02] <ccmonster> alright i re-restarted the router
[04:02] <nperea> hello
[04:02] <nperea> there
[04:02] <ccmonster> how do i see what is happening AS the card tried to connect to the wireess?
[04:02] <escott> jmcantrell, its a bit more like pick your features, ext2=basic ext3=ext2+journal which would wear out an ssd, ext4=ext3+extents, but you can have ext4-journal if you need
[04:02] <ccmonster> wireless*
[04:03] <escott> atdprhs, what are the partition numbers of the relevent partitions
[04:03] <nperea> i have a problem with my httrack offline software
[04:03] <jmcantrell> would i need journalling on an external drive?
[04:03] <nperea> it doesnt work
[04:03] <theadmin> nperea: ?
[04:03] <atdprhs> sdb1
[04:04] <atdprhs> then sdb2
[04:04] <nperea> somebody help me
[04:04] <theadmin> jmcantrell: Unless you plan power failures, no
[04:04] <atdprhs> then sdb3
[04:04] <theadmin> nperea: Define "doesn't work".
[04:04] <atdprhs> the unallocated is sdb2
[04:04] <escott> jmcantrell, ever knocked a usb cord out? then yes
[04:04] <atdprhs> there is 3 and 4 and 5
[04:04] <escott> !enter | atdprhs
[04:04] <ubottu> atdprhs: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line. Don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[04:04] <atdprhs> I mean 5 and 6 only, no 3 or 4
[04:04] <escott> atdprhs, and what is what?
[04:04] <stanley_> Hi Guys, need some serious help with my graphics card...anybody got some time?
[04:05] <theadmin> atdprhs: Send a screenshot please, so it's less confusing
[04:05] <ambar> ,'
[04:05] <theadmin> stanley_: Just ask the question, whoever knows will help
[04:05] <atdprhs> there is sdb1, sdb2 (Extended)(, unallocated, sdb5, sdb6
[04:05] <nperea> theadmin it that software in win version track an entire website and download it for offline browsing
[04:05] <theadmin> nperea: I know what it does.
[04:05] <urlin2u> stanley_, name the card and the question?
[04:05] <theadmin> nperea: How it "doesn't work"?
[04:05] <bennis> is there a way to access the 'system' menu with the keyboard in gnome?
[04:05] <nperea> but here in ubunto when i try i get an error
[04:06] <nperea> it didnt nothing
[04:06] <escott> bennis, do you have a terminal?
[04:06] <atdprhs> okayz
[04:06] <theadmin> nperea: For god's sake, WHAT error?
[04:06] <bennis> escott: yes, i'm in irc in it right now
[04:06] <atdprhs> theadmin, how do I send the screenshot?
[04:06] <stanley_> ok running natty with an ATI technologies inc Rage 128 RK/VR graphics card, need to install the driver so I can get desktop effects and a clearer resolution
[04:06] <bennis> escott: i'm trying to turn on mouse keys
[04:07] <escott> bennis, have you tried gnome-control-center or gnome-sys[TAB] i think its the first
[04:07] <theadmin> atdprhs: Printscreen. Save. Upload to your favorite image hosting site.
[04:07] <stanley_> propriety drivers arent available
[04:08] <linuxuz3r_> sup
[04:09] <ActionParsnip> stanley_: single monitor system?
[04:09] <stanley_> yepp single monitor
[04:09] <The_Rufus> stupid Highpoint, release drivers but the tar file is missing the .h files
[04:09] <atdprhs> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/171/screenshotib.png/
[04:10] <theadmin> atdprhs: ookay, that's a pretty confusing setup
[04:10] <nperea> ok theadmin
[04:11] <urlin2u> linuxuz3r_, need anything?
[04:11] <atdprhs> what do I do?
[04:11] <linuxuz3r_> just saying sup
[04:11] <nperea> the admin it start to work properly
[04:11] <bennis> escott: thanks, it was the first one
[04:12] <nperea> thank a lot
[04:12] <bennis> escott: coulda just alt-f2'd that too xD
[04:12] <escott> atdprhs, you can add the 1.91 to part 5 by moving 5 to the left and then growing it. but it takes two steps
[04:12] <ActionParsnip> stanley_: what res do you use?
[04:13] <smw> Does anyone know what the feature difference is between ubottu's encyclopedia plugin and the supybot factoids plugin?
[04:13] <theadmin> nperea: Uhh... %)
[04:13] <stanley_> right now I am restriced to 1024 x 768 because my graphics card driver isn't installed properly, but you can see that the screen is out of focused and it fits awkwardly on the monitor
[04:14] <rww> smw: Metadiscussion about ubottu is more likely to get a response in #ubuntu-bots-team. It's a bit offtopic here :)
[04:14] <ActionParsnip> stanley_: is 1024x768 ok for you if it was sharper?
[04:14] <theadmin> atdprhs: I also wanted to suggest Bleachbit, which is a program to help you remove a ton of junk (e.g. temporary files, cache, etc) from your disk
[04:14] <stanley_> Essentially I would like to use a larger resolution
[04:14] <smw> rww, awesome, thanks for the tip
[04:14] <ActionParsnip> stanley_: that's what I'm asking. What res do you want?
[04:14] <stanley_> it would be if it was sharper
[04:14] <nperea> the admin a have a question
[04:15] <nperea> its about virtualbox
[04:15] <atdprhs> I will use that program, but I really want to decrease the swap to 1 GB and give the file system another extra 1 GB
[04:15] <atdprhs> Escott, I don't understand how that is possible
[04:15] <stanley_> I am not 100% certain what resolution I would like really it depends on how it fits on my screen once I see it
[04:15] <stanley_> but 1024 x 768 would be ok if it were sharper
[04:15] <escott> atdprhs, what filesystem? you have three of them. please be more specific
[04:15] <nperea> theadmin i have a question about virtualbox
[04:15] <theadmin> nperea: Ask it
[04:15] <atdprhs> sdb7 is home
[04:16] <escott> atdprhs, there is no 7
[04:16] <ActionParsnip> stanley_: ok run:  gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:16] <atdprhs> and sdb6 -> I don't know about that, because I did not really requested the manual partition to create it, I want to give 1 extra GB to sdb1
[04:16] <ActionParsnip> stanley_: paste in this text: http://pastebin.com/Av4NA1jY
[04:16] <nperea> theadmin it is posible to conect harware to a virtualized os
[04:17] <atdprhs> there is sdb7 which is 977.14, please look at the uploaded picture again
[04:17] <theadmin> nperea: Depends on what hardware you mean.
[04:17] <escott> atdprhs, im looking at it. there is no 7
[04:17] <stanley_> ok and save?
[04:17] <The_Rufus> AAAAAARRRRGGHHH!!!!! Why can't I do something as simple as get RAID to work!!! I hate highpoint now
[04:17] <The_Rufus> copmletely
[04:17] <atdprhs> oh
[04:17] <atdprhs> it is sdb6
[04:17] <The_Rufus> what use is having incomplete drivers on your website
[04:17] <nperea> theadmin so i want to get two fisical pcs working one with the host os
[04:18] <escott> atdprhs, and there is nothing that is 977.14. there is sdb6 which has 977.14 used, but is actually 1.07GB in size
[04:18] <nperea> theadmin and the another working with the guest os
[04:18] <jukebox-zero> Ok. So after make gets done compiling and starts linking the code for ffmpeg I get an output like "/home/jukebox-zero/ffmpeg/libavcodec/libx264.c:404: undefined reference to `x264_encoder_open_116'" among others. So I get that this is an unresolved symbol, but ok, now what. Am I missing the .c file or ? I checked the directory CC complained about but ~/ffmpeg/libavcodec doesn't seem to exist.
[04:18] <escott> atdprhs, now where do you want to add this free space
[04:18] <theadmin> nperea: Well, Virtualbox can boot from real hard drives
[04:18] <nperea> it is that posibole
[04:18] <atdprhs> sdb6 is home, sdb5, I don't know what is about it, because I didn't manually create it, I want to add 1 GB to sdb1
[04:18] <theadmin> nperea: Other than that, idk
=== aztek1 is now known as aztek
[04:19] <stanley_> ActionParsnip: ok I pasted and saved that
[04:20] <atdprhs> escott, I want to add the free space to sdb1
[04:20] <nperea> how i can config two keyboard one of them to work with the real machine and the another working with the guest machine
[04:20] <nperea> ???
[04:20] <jukebox-zero> Er, LD, not CC sorry. Missed a line: collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
[04:20] <escott> atdprhs, to do that, you would first have to delete 2, but doing so will automatically also delete 5 and 6. it is possible (but very dangerous) to write down the exact block locations of 5 and 6, then delete part 2 and recreate a new part 2 that is perfectly partitioned to allow you to exactly recreate part 5 and part 6 thus freeing space for part 1. i would NOT recommend you do this
[04:20] <nperea> the same with the mouse
=== _BS__ is now known as _BS_
=== _BS_ is now known as Guest7506
[04:21] <ActionParsnip> stanley_: ok, reboot to test. If it is bad then hold shift at boot, select roecovery mode then select root and run:  mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf_old       note the X ni X11 is capitalized. You can then run: reboot and you will be back where you are now
[04:21] <The_Rufus> can anyone tell me how to install drivers for Highpoint RocketRaid 2320 on Ubuntu 11 server edition? Please?
[04:21] <escott> atdprhs, you could see if gparted will do this for you by seeing if you can select part 2 and resize it
[04:22] <bazhang> The_Rufus, drivers for what
[04:22] <atdprhs> I did it
[04:23] <The_Rufus> HighPoint Rocket Raid 2320
[04:23] <atdprhs> how can I create the swap?
[04:23] <atdprhs> ("I did not delete 5 and 6)
[04:23] <bazhang> The_Rufus, wireless card, or something else
[04:23] <The_Rufus> I downloaded the driver from mhea: http://www.highpoint-tech.cn/BIOS_Driver/page/rr232x.htm
[04:23] <stanley_> ActionParsnip: ok if it is good what should I expect?
[04:23] <The_Rufus> RAID controller
[04:23] <theadmin> atdprhs: Choose any unallocated space you may have, create some partition there, format it to linux-swap
[04:24] <The_Rufus> Downloaded the Open Source driver and tried a make, but it tells me it needs a .h file which it can't find
[04:24] <mASOUD_42> hi, http://paste.ubuntu.com/667839/   this is a scrip using "zenity" to show a GUI message. it works when invoked form a terminal but when crontab calls it, it doesn't work.what's wrong?here's the crontab line i use http://paste.ubuntu.com/667844/
[04:25] <atdprhs> okayz
[04:26] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: you dont have the full path to the script.. and are you running it as your user (the cron). and does it have $DISPLAY set?
[04:26] <FriGiN> urlin2u: im finally into ubuntu off a flash drive, for whatever reason it was having troubles had to move the usb to another port.. what now
[04:26] <atdprhs> I will reboot and test it, if it worked, I did not touch sdb5 and 6, it should work specially with the 1 GB linux-swap, right?
[04:27] <mASOUD_42> SIFTU, i placed the script in ~/bin . yea i run as user like i type crontab -e for editing it. dont know about $display
[04:28] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: but ~/bin isnt in the $PATH
[04:28] <urlin2u> FriGiN, in the terminal run all the commands together, a text file will be in home copy and paste all of it to a pastebin and post the http.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/667640/
[04:28] <escott> atdprhs, you may need to adjust your /etc/fstab to reflect the new swap
[04:28] <urlin2u> FriGiN, link is the commands
[04:28] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: you could add to the $PATH in your script.. or just use the full path in the crontab
[04:28] <FriGiN> urlin2u: net.. cant wget
[04:29] <FriGiN> urlin2u: oops.. no net. cant wget
[04:29] <mASOUD_42> SIFTU, i can run it only by typing its name. does it mean its in $PATH?
[04:29] <escott> SIFTU, by default ~/bin is in the path (if it exists)
[04:29] <urlin2u> FriGiN, didn't we talk about actually getting plugged in to get to the net?
[04:29] <The_Rufus> gah i give up
[04:30] <FriGiN> i told you i cant..
[04:30] <intrader> Anyone, elinks text terminal connects properly to network printer hosted by cups on a mac. The elinks program is able to do administrative tasks as well as print a test page. However, the 'Applications->System->Printing applet is not able to locate the printer and connect.
[04:30] <FriGiN> urlin2u: no cable/dls im on my cell phone via tether.. has to have wifi
[04:30] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: ah ok.. well I would look at $DISPLAY while running in cron
[04:31] <mASOUD_42> SIFTU, ok ty. I'm gonna google the $DISPLAY
[04:31] <urlin2u> FriGiN, we just need more info to help you that means net access for doing this on that computer.
[04:31] <escott> mASOUD_42, if you want a cron job to show something visually you need to export DISPLAY=:0 and XAUTHORITY=$HOME/.XAuthority first
[04:31] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: you can "echo $DISPLAY" in a terminal.. then get your script to write it out to a file to compare
[04:32] <urlin2u> FriGiN, I thought I was clear about that, we don't fix what we don't know.
[04:32] <FriGiN> urlin2u: i am going to try to use easytether see if that works.. it hasnt b4.. but lets hope
[04:32] <SIFTU> escott:  sounds right
[04:33] <FriGiN> urlin2u: i can dl on this pc, move it via usb to that pc and run it..
[04:33] <Nach0z> Hey i got a bit of an issue here... i'm trying to install Ubuntu 11.04 x64 from a CD and the installer is straightup not working. the only info i can get from it is "Installer has reached an unrecoverable error"
[04:33] <feng_> Does anybody use the vim + ctags to browse the kernel source code?
[04:33] <mASOUD_42> escott, export it where?  SIFTU , echo $DISPLAY returned :0.0
[04:33] <urlin2u> FriGiN, there you go if you can transfer between the two we can look at the boot script. ;-)
[04:33] <Nach0z> and then it boots into desktop mode. When i select the "help me boot from a CD" in the WUBI installer it gives me a permission denied error
[04:34] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: in your script so as escott said
[04:34] <escott> mASOUD_42, in your script before you call the program which will connect to the Xserver
[04:34] <r3b00t> anybody maybe able to help me figure out why my netbook wont connect to my network?
[04:35] <mASOUD_42> SIFTU, escott , ok,let me try it
[04:35] <FriGiN> urlin2u: is there a tar for that.. do i just need the .sh file?
[04:35] <urlin2u> FriGiN, the wget will do it all and ask for a pasword.
[04:35] <r3b00t> when I try to connect to my router it says "network failed: bad password" but I didnt put it in wrong
[04:36] <urlin2u> the .sh  file is the one run though FriGiN
[04:36] <FriGiN> url i need to download whatever it is, and move it via usb, then install it.. then paste to pastebin for you..
[04:36] <jukebox-zero> Am I correct in assuming the message "~/ffmpeg/libavcodec/libx264.c:404: undefined reference to `x264_encoder_open_116'" is referring to line 404 in libx264.c?
[04:36] <FriGiN> so i can just put the .sh file on my usb

[04:40] <urlin2u> FriGiN, here is the actual site if needed.  http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
[04:40] <jukebox-zero> theadmin: thanks. based on google, man pages, etc I know I'm looking for most likely an unresolved symbol, but this is all kind of new territory to me. This is line 404: " x4->enc = x264_encoder_open(&x4->params); " but I don't really know what I would need to check to see if it's actually bad. C is still a foreign language for me.

[04:49] <blomp> how do i get the two finger scroll working on ubuntu 11.04?
[04:49] <mASOUD_42> escott, there's no .Xauthority in my home directory :(
[04:50] <rickjaruiz> anyone wanna help a noob from windows?
[04:50] <escott> mASOUD_42, what is echo $XAUTHORITY say
[04:50] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: I dont think that one is so important as it's running as your user
[04:51] <FloatingGoat> Is there a channel for ubuntu sound production?
[04:51] <blomp> how do i get the two finger scroll working on ubuntu 11.04?
[04:51] <mASOUD_42> escott, SIFTU it say "/var/run/gdm/auth-for-masoud-pipvLh/database"
[04:52] <jukebox-zero> my best guess is it's not finding libx264-dev but it's installed so this is just ... odd.
[04:52] <escott> mASOUD_42, thats annoying. that location will change with each gdm login. you could create a script that on login copies that file to .Xauthority or symlinks as needed
[04:53] <mASOUD_42> escott, you mean create a cron job that runs on every boot?
[04:55] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: I would start with "export DISPLAY=:0" in yur script and using full paths when calling your script
[04:55] <escott> mASOUD_42, no a script that you would add to your gnome-session to make it so your cron session can find the xauth files it needs
[04:55] <SIFTU> I didnt think cron processed .bashrc and I'm not sure where ~/bin is added to the $PATH
[04:56] <escott> SIFTU, he needs the authority file too. the display is not enough

[04:57] <greg3000> hiya friends, I just upgraded my ubuntu box to the latest distro and now the thing just reboots after passing the grub menu.  Anyone else experiencing this?
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[04:58] <escott> SIFTU, or maybe not, but i would think so
[04:58] <urlin2u> greg3000, maverick to natty upgrade?
[04:58] <SIFTU> escott: ok, but man xauth doesn suggest that
[04:58] <theadmin> greg3000: Upgrading Ubuntu breaks a lot and is somewhat dangerous. I suggest backing your /home up and reinstalling altogether.
[04:58] <greg3000> urlin2u: yes, natty, it gave me the new 2.6.38-10 kernel
[05:00] <greg3000> theadmin: gosh, never knew that.  at one point I was able to get into repair, but having trouble getting to that point tonight.  can I not run some commands to rebuild the initrd or something?  I guess I am not the only one who experienced this
[05:00] <urlin2u> greg3000, boot a ubuntu cd, and run the all the commands together in a terminal and paste bin the RESULTS.txt that will be in home. http://paste.ubuntu.com/667640/
[05:00] <theadmin> greg3000: Hm, I'm not sure how to rebuild initrd on Ubuntu. Try "mkinitcpio", though can't guarantee anything there
[05:00] <greg3000> urlin2u: ok I will check it out
[05:00] <greg3000> theadmin: ok thanks for the suggestion
[05:01] <urlin2u> greg3000, theadmin may be correct did you get a clean upgrade?
[05:03] <greg3000> urlin2u: this was a minimal 10.10 install running only command line, and so I upgraded from the command line.  Everything seemed to work fine, just after rebooting the screen goes off shortly after it passes the grub menu
[05:03] <greg3000> then it reboots
[05:03] <blomp> how do i get my touchpad tab to show back up in mouse preferences?
[05:04] <escott> SIFTU, i think if the Xauthority is in a non-standard place then you need to specify where it is. since mine is in ~/.Xauthority i don't seem to need to do the export provided $HOME is set correctly
[05:04] <urlin2u> greg3000, okay you might just follow this guide, 3 methods here a load from a Natty only cd or use the third chroot if another ubuntu cd. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Copy%20LiveCD%20Files
[05:05] <greg3000> urlin2u: ok thanks again
[05:05] <urlin2u> greg3000, if your running headless you could follow this I assume. ;-)
[05:06] <greg3000> urlin2u: aye it's a headless box
[05:06] <urlin2u> greg3000, grub2 is the link I assume here as well.
[05:06] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: my try worked
[05:07] <greg3000> urlin2u: I think it is grub2, gonna go start hacking away.  thanks - will report back
[05:07] <SIFTU> escott: trying it with .Xauth moved
[05:07] <SIFTU> date
[05:07] <urlin2u> greg3000, cool if you had a upgrade that needs restarting there are a couple of commands  as well.
[05:08] <urlin2u> finishing actually*
[05:10] <SIFTU> escott: yep.. you are right.. ~/.Xauthority has to exist then you dont need to export
[05:11] <Guest44352> hello all
[05:11] <escott> SIFTU, thats funny... im on 11.10 and having the exact opposite. mine is promiscous as the enable xhost, but put the xauth back in the right place
[05:12] <escott> SIFTU, it took me so long to figure out how to deal with gdm putting the xauth file in /var and now im using lightdm and the server just doesnt care
[05:12] <mASOUD_42> SIFTU, escott , i changed the script to this http://paste.ubuntu.com/667922/        also i changed the cron tab to absolute path but it didn't work
[05:12] <harry_> whats the diffrence between 'su' command and 'sudo su -' command ???
[05:12] <SIFTU> escott: I'm using openbox.. and I cant open anything if I move ~/Xauthority
[05:13] <theadmin> harry_: You shouldn't use either of those.
[05:13] <theadmin> harry_: You should use "sudo -i"
[05:13] <TheUros> hi, i have a question ... i hava an old asus eee 900 netbook wich has 4gb + 8gb ssd ... how i can partition this two drives for ubuntu ? .. can i put entire installation on 4gb and leave 8gb for home ?? ...
[05:13] <escott> mASOUD_42, the problem you will have is that pipvLH will change every time you login. so you either have to find it each time (you know it will start the same) or force gdm to put the Xauthority in ~/.Xauthority or use xhost to enable host based authentication (less secure)
[05:14] <ActionParsnip> harry_: su is for switch user, default is to root which is disabled, sudo su   wil get you a root shell but use: sudo -i   instead
[05:14] <harry_> theadmin: but when my application runs it ask for the root password and when i supply the root password my application runs under the root privilages and at that time i am not able to assess the "env | grep GDM_LANG" variable.
[05:15] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: this worked for me but I have a ~/.Xauthority
[05:15] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: http://pastebin.com/pRHhxrRB
[05:15] <statim> anyone familiar with pbuilder know how to clean up the environment.  i built something in it, but now there are a bunch of .deb files in the pbuilder area
[05:15] <ActionParsnip> harry_: run the app with sudo and use your own password
[05:15] <harry_> but when i do 'su' command i can asssess the "env | grep GDM_LANG" but when i do 'sudo su -' i am not able to assess it.
[05:16] <harry_> ActionParsnip:its a GUI application launch on Double click.
[05:16] <ActionParsnip> harry_: you can launch gui apps with gksudo
[05:16] <theadmin> !gksu | harry_
[05:16] <ubottu> harry_: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
[05:16] <harry_> i am usng installerjammer which has no such fasility for it.
[05:17] <escott> harry_, launching gui apps from su can break your gui config for non-root users
[05:17] <ActionParsnip> harry_: fnie, but your OS does
[05:17] <ActionParsnip> *fine
[05:18] <harry_> ActionParsnip:but in iNstallljammer there is a build in command for it and i am not able to chnage is sadly.
[05:18] <mASOUD_42> escott, SIFTU , well how can i force the gdm to make the .Xauthority?
=== leon is now known as Guest92717
[05:18] <ActionParsnip> harry_: you are missing the point
[05:19] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: not sure on that.. I dont use gdm
[05:19] <ActionParsnip> harry_: the command apt-get doesn't "have the facility" just the same, but if you prefix it with sudo it run, it gives the access
[05:19] <yetone> 测试
[05:19] <ActionParsnip> harry_: so you need to make a launcher to run:  gksudo command
=== salmenara is now known as Varanger
[05:20] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: probably in you r gdm.conf
[05:20] <rww> !cn | yetone
[05:20] <ubottu> yetone: 如欲獲得中文的協助，請輸入 /join #ubuntu-cn 或 /join #ubuntu-tw
[05:20] <escott> mASOUD_42, no idea
[05:20] <afschuld> Hi bitches
[05:21] <harry_> No i am not missing the point but the problem is i just want to understand the basic thing that what happen if i launch my application when it ask for the root password does it use the command 'su' or 'sudo su -'???just the technical clarification i need
[05:21] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: UserAuthDir=
[05:21] <rww> !guidelines | afschuld
[05:21] <ubottu> afschuld: The guidelines for using the Ubuntu channels can be found here: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines
[05:21] <ActionParsnip> harry_: this will make it run with elevated priveledges, it is moot what the command is so saying install jammer doesn't have the facility is nonesense. There are tools in Ubuntu to give it the access it needs. Hell you can even run web browsers with te extra access and they don't have the facility either
[05:21] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: The directory where user's .Xauthority file should be saved. When nothing is specfied the user's home directory is used.
[05:21] <ActionParsnip> harry_: there is no root password in Ubuntu
[05:21] <niche> Hey guys, still trying to resolve a problem I've been having. I have two HDDs, one with Windows 7 and after installing 11.04 Ubuntu on my other HDD I am no longer able to boot the Windows 7 HDD if my Ubuntu HDD is disconnected or if the priority of my W7 HDD is first. I get stuck at "grub>" every time. Can anyone help?
[05:22] <SIFTU> niche: sounds like you blew away the bootloader for windows
[05:22] <urlin2u> niche, were you able to get the sdb drive changed in the bios to be read first?
[05:22] <niche> SIFTU, any way to fix that without formatting Windows?
[05:23] <ActionParsnip> harry_: as a user which is what you are, when you launch any app without sudo etc, it runs as your user. That's all
[05:23] <harry_> ActionParsnip:so when i launch my applicationa and it ask for the root password what happnes at time??
[05:23] <SIFTU> niche: PM
[05:23] <niche> urlin2u, yes I was and can boot Ubuntu without a problem as long as it is first priority. However, I do not always have this hard drive connected and it poses a big issue if I can't boot W7 without using the grub loader on the Ubuntu HDD
[05:23] <escott> niche, you installed grub to the w7 mbr, put it on the other drives mbr, then you can restore the w7 bootloader if you want
[05:24] <urlin2u> SIFTU, easy fix just needs sdb first read and grub loaded to the mbr of sdb
[05:24] <ActionParsnip> harry_: there is no root password so it will fail. The app is running as user. If you prefix the command with gksudo then it will already be running as root and you wil not be challenged
[05:24] <SIFTU> urlin2u: even when he pulls the linux disk?
[05:25] <urlin2u> niche, so when yo boot ubuntu did you run sudo update-grub
[05:25] <urlin2u> SIFTU, not sure
[05:25] <gurifisu> i plugged in my nikon with a cf card instead, and it appeared on the desktop, but i am unable to write anything onto it (eg. paste)
[05:25] <niche> urlin2u, yes... I have tried all the tricks to restore the W7 boot
[05:25] <SIFTU> urlin2u: I dont think he wants grub on his win 7 disk.. its a seperate disk
[05:25] <sgo11> ricky26, hi, are you there? yesterday, I asked the question regarding low screen resolution problem. now, I found the cause.
[05:25] <mASOUD_42> SIFTU, where is the gdm.conf ?
[05:25] <urlin2u> SIFTU, I'm not suggesting that.
[05:26] <urlin2u> SIFTU, sda is windows sdb is linux
[05:27] <Susie> 0.0
[05:27] <urlin2u> niche, run this whole wget from the ubuntu terminal and pastebin the RESULTS/text that will be in home.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/667640/
[05:27] <SIFTU> urlin2u: yeah but when he pulls his linux disk out.. he wants to boot off his windows disk
[05:27] <urlin2u> SIFTU, I will get the MS bootloader in the sda it is one command
[05:28] <ricky26> sgo11: What was it?
[05:28] <SIFTU> urlin2u: yes. restore the win mbr
[05:28] <urlin2u> SIFTU, or you can its cool. ;-)
[05:28] <SIFTU> urlin2u: go for it.. dd bs=512 count=1? I dont have a win mbr
[05:28] <urlin2u> SIFTU, I'm just concerned all the bootfiles are there the script will tell us.
[05:29] <SIFTU> mASOUD_42: try in /etc/gdm or something
[05:29] <anderson> hi
[05:29] <urlin2u> niche, can you run that wget and get the script posted?
[05:29] <anderson> can some one help me ?
[05:29] <niche> running now
[05:29] <sgo11> ricky26, it's just because of the VGA cable. I never knew VGA cables have different versions. one is 3+6 VGA cable. one is 3+4 VGA cable. 3+6 VGA cable supports 1080p. 3+4 VGA cable only supports 1024x768. After changing the VGA cable, the problem is solved.
[05:30] <ricky26> sgo11: I never knew that. XD
[05:30] <urlin2u> niche, cool you have a windows install disc, or a recovery disc?
[05:30] <sgo11> ricky26, :) I never knew this either. very weird.
[05:30] <niche> urlin2u, yes but God only know where it is at. I've moved twice since installing :(
[05:31] <urlin2u> niche, you will need it or we can put lilo there from a ubuntu disc.
[05:31] <anderson> hi
[05:31] <anderson> i need help please
[05:31] <SIFTU> anderson: just ask
[05:31] <anderson> can some one help me ?
[05:31] <anderson> ok
[05:31] <urlin2u> anderson, ask away man.;-)
[05:32] <niche> urlin2u, http://www.mediafire.com/?q3a6a6re94bxm9v
[05:32] <anderson> i have ubuntu 11 vps
[05:32] <anderson> i need uinstal gui on it
[05:32] <niche> lilo?
[05:32] <anderson> i need very light gui
[05:32] <ActionParsnip> anderson: sudo apt-get install lxde     will give a light ui
[05:32] <anderson> i need lighter than lxde
[05:33] <SIFTU> anderson: twm :)
[05:33] <niche> Ah, just wikipedia'ed lilo... this will work for a Windows disk?
[05:33] <popey> anderson: fvwm
[05:33] <anderson> open box or something lik that
[05:33] <anderson> can u give me all the command
[05:33] <anderson> ?
[05:33] <SIFTU> anderson: then do openbox
[05:33] <BILLYKANE> icewm and fluxbox
[05:33] <anderson> can u give me the command  ?
[05:34] <ActionParsnip> anderson: then change lxde for openbox or whatever you want, same command
[05:34] <popey> anderson: sudo apt-get install fvwm
[05:34] <EightySix> hi all. i'm trying to setup a home server using apache2 + dyndns. I'm not sure if my website is up. http://jumpingcrabs.dyndns.info/
[05:34] <blomp> what does it mean my touchpad tab doesnt come up in mouse options?
[05:34] <EightySix> What text do you see?
[05:34] <popey> EightySix: sparta
[05:34] <EightySix> thanks :D
[05:34] <anderson> but u going to help me on setup vncserver + config the xtratup ?
[05:34] <ActionParsnip> anderson: why not just skip the gui and use cli
[05:34] <urlin2u> niche, here it is for everybody to see, hold on http://paste.ubuntu.com/667936/
[05:34] <ActionParsnip> !vnc | anderson
[05:34] <ubottu> anderson: VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[05:34] <TheUros> anyone....
[05:35] <anderson> yes i need vnc to connect to my vps graphical interface
[05:35] <SIFTU> anderson: have you ever run openbox before?
[05:35] <anderson> no
[05:36] <blomp> what does it mean my touchpad tab doesnt come up in mouse options?
[05:36] <SIFTU> anderson: it's a little more than 1 command
[05:36] <ActionParsnip> anderson: that guide wil show how to do it more securely. VNC has zero encryption
[05:36] <ActionParsnip> anderson: why not configure just with an SSH terminal?
[05:36] <anderson> ok what is the commands ?
[05:36] <ActionParsnip> anderson: read the link!
[05:36] <anderson> wich link ?
[05:36] <urlin2u> niche, so you have a grub file in the windows partition we can manualy remove it from sdb2
[05:37] <anderson> i already connected to the vps via shh , and waiting to just get the commands
[05:37] <ActionParsnip> anderson: read what ubottu said.
[05:37] <urlin2u> niche, open that partition click on boot and remove anything named grub
[05:37] <mASOUD_42> EightySix, THIS IS SPARTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[05:37] <anderson> i already installed vnc + lxde + gnome on many servers
[05:37] <EightySix> mASOUD_42, Thanks.
[05:38] <urlin2u> niche sdb2 okay.
[05:38] <anderson> but now the things is change because i need something light
[05:38] <mASOUD_42> EightySix, np ;)
[05:38] <gskelling> does anybody have experience with the bumblebee hybrid graphics drivers for linux?
[05:38] <SIFTU> gskelling: yes
[05:38] <ActionParsnip> anderson: it makes them use more resources, take longer to boot and makes them less secure
[05:38] <niche> urlin2u, ok wait so how do I open that partition and delete anything named grub?
[05:38] <gskelling> ah, SIFTU
[05:38] <gskelling> I'm back =D
[05:38] <niche> urlin2u, I'm a noober
[05:38] <SIFTU> gskelling: bad experiences :) well it was working but performance wasnt any good
[05:39] <anderson> i really didnt understand
[05:39] <gskelling> bad experiences eh. hm
[05:39] <anderson> because u didnt understand what i want
[05:39] <SIFTU> anderson: openbox isnt much lighter than lxde.. as lxde uses openbox as it;s WM
[05:39] <gskelling> for my laptop, people have found ways to disable both the intel one and the nvidia one, I can't decide which route I should go
[05:39] <urlin2u> niche, no problem if your in Ubunrtu go to home and look in the side left panel for partitions I can give you a screen shot of what it looks like if wanted.
[05:39] <anderson> ok
[05:39] <anderson> so i install lxde its better than open box ?
[05:39] <blomp> what does it mean my touchpad tab doesnt come up in mouse options?
[05:39] <SIFTU> gskelling: ok you can disable the intel one? do that
[05:40] <ActionParsnip> anderson: its a nicer experience but you can run just openbox
[05:40] <don-i> so this is a non ubuntu q, but i think you guys might know. Can any router be used as an AP ?
[05:40] <niche> urlin2u, Gotcha. Now how do I find anything named Grub on this large 1TB HDD? lol
[05:40] <don-i> or "repeater"
[05:40] <ActionParsnip> anderson: like I said, it doesn't do the server any favours using a gui
[05:40] <SIFTU> anderson: well not exactly.. but the DE in LXDE isnt that much heavier than plain openbox
[05:40] <gskelling> SIFTU, I get much better battery life with just the intel one though
[05:40] <ActionParsnip> don-i: I'd ask in ##networking
[05:40] <SIFTU> gskelling: yeah.. do you game?
[05:40] <don-i> ActionParsnip, thanks :)
[05:41] <urlin2u> niche, the boot file look here. http://imagebin.org/168271
[05:41] <gskelling> SIFTU, a little, not much
[05:41] <anderson> i need to get connected to my vps via vnc and for do that i need graphical inteface to open browser , open programs etc ..
[05:41] <harry_> Ok guys thanks for the information...
[05:41] <harry_> :)
[05:41] <ActionParsnip> anderson: but it's a server, what programs do you need?
[05:41] <SIFTU> gskelling: well the intel one is fine if you dont.. and with kernel 3.0 is actually pretty good (2000fps in glxgears)
[05:41] <anderson> browser like chromium etc ..
[05:42] <niche> urlin2u, OK, deleted the Grub folder out of boot, woot. Now is this like a Mac where I have to empty the trash bin? lol
[05:42] <ActionParsnip> anderson: then its not a server, its a desktop system
[05:42] <urlin2u> niche, look on that main page and the boot file for anything grub.
[05:42] <gskelling> SIFTU, also disabling the intel graphics card requires me to turn my ASUS laptops SATA mode to "compatible" instead of "Enhanced" which I'm afraid would mess up the performance of my SSD
[05:42] <sorcerer> ?
[05:42] <anderson> yes i need install desktop on vps
[05:42] <ActionParsnip> anderson: why would you want to vnc to a system to run a browser exactly?
[05:42] <SIFTU> gskelling: you are lucky you have the option.. I'm stuck
[05:42] <gskelling> SIFTU, what laptop?
[05:43] <anderson> just to browse and use the vps as desktop as i use my computer desktop
[05:43] <niche> urlin2u, there was only 1 item inside of the boot folder. It was a folder called Grub and I deleted it. Is there anything else I need to hunt down and delete? I don't know what you mean by main page
[05:43] <SIFTU> gskelling: dell XPS 15 l502x
[05:43] <gskelling> I worked on one of those today! =P
[05:43] <SIFTU> lol
[05:43] <ActionParsnip> anderson: the guide ubottu gave shows how you can use an SSH tunnel to secure vnc
[05:43] <gskelling> big huge honkin' things, but they are powerful
[05:43] <anderson> what is the lighter browser on ubuntu
[05:43] <anderson> i think dinno ?
[05:44] <SIFTU> gskelling: yeah has the i7 quad
[05:44] <gskelling> is it hard to get the 3.0 kernel working well on ubuntu 11.04?
[05:44] <ActionParsnip> anderson: arora is light, or lynx
[05:45] <gskelling> maybe I'll try the intel one with that first, I really don't want to reduce the performance of my ssd
[05:45] <anderson> arora ?
[05:45] <ActionParsnip> gskelling: shouldn't be too hard but you won't be supported here as it;s a 3rd party kernel
[05:45] <SIFTU> gskelling: you could get it from a PPA or manually compile it
[05:45] <urlin2u> niche, no run the script again so we can see that the grub.image is gone, be sure to tab my nic to. ;-)
[05:45] <ActionParsnip> anderson: yes?
[05:45] <anderson> i realy didnt understand your last reply
[05:46] <niche> tab your nic to? Elaboration?
[05:46] <SIFTU> niche: means autocomplete.. start typing a nic and press tab
[05:46] <urlin2u> niche, and paste here. http://paste.ubuntu.com/
[05:46] <niche> lol
[05:46] <niche> I'm such an idiot
[05:48] <niche> urlin2u, http://paste.ubuntu.com/667946/
[05:49] <ActionParsnip> anderson: arora is  alight browser, you asked for the name of a browser, so I gave arora as a suggestion.
[05:49] <anderson> arora is lighter than dinno ?
[05:50] <ActionParsnip> anderson: its a light browser, much lighter than firefox and such
[05:50] <SIFTU> anderson: define lighter
[05:50] <ActionParsnip> anderson: there is also swiftfox and iceweasel
[05:50] <urlin2u> niche, good job it is gone, now I would prefer putting the MS boot in the mbr, but lilo (another bootloader) works for booting windows
[05:51] <urlin2u> niche, can you find that MS disc, or you want lilo?
[05:51] <anderson> ok thank u , but i need if u can please just the lighter one on ubuntu
[05:51] <niche> urlin2u, hmmmmmmm. Let me take a look for that disk. How much trouble is it to do this with lilo?
[05:51] <ActionParsnip> anderson: I'm not quite sure. I'd go for arora. If you want the lightest then Lynx will use very few resources and doesn't even need an x server to be present
[05:52] <urlin2u> niche, just a ubuntu disc boot and opening the universal repo and two commands
[05:52] <anderson> sudo apt-get install Lynx ?
[05:52] <ActionParsnip> anderson: lower case l
[05:52] <ActionParsnip> anderson: it will work, but has no flash support
[05:53] <anderson> and what is the lighter browser have flash support
[05:53] <ActionParsnip> anderson: arora
[05:54] <BILLYKANE> QtWeb??
[05:54] <ActionParsnip> anderson: flash will most likely run high cpu usage on the box, depends how much CPU power you have
[05:54] <flametai1> Anyone in here have an HP Slate 500?
[05:54] <niche> urlin2u, so I use the 11.04 Live CD to do it? How do I go about opening the universal repo?
[05:54] <Kartagis> !gnome3
[05:54] <ubottu> Gnome 3 is not currently supported on Ubuntu. A PPA for natty is available at https://launchpad.net/~gnome3-team/+archive/gnome3 but these packages are EXPERIMENTAL and UNSTABLE, will break Unity and possibly other parts of your system, and cannot be downgraded safely.
[05:55] <niche> urlin2u, does lilo have any strange quirks that the Windows bootloader would not have?
[05:55] <niche> like annoyances when booting the W7 HDD
[05:56] <SIFTU> anderson: http://paste.ubuntu.com/667953/ <-- take your pick
[05:56] <urlin2u> niche, open synaptic-settings-repositories first tab tick universe, close those windows leaving synaptic open hit reload then close sysnaptic and open a terminal.
[05:57] <zambaboo> is it possible to install other releases using nattys' netboot?
[05:57] <zambaboo> (pxe, preseed)
[05:58] <anderson> thank you very much
[05:58] <urlin2u> niche, no lilo you will never see it windos bot will show like normal, especially if from the HD.
[05:58] <urlin2u> windows boot
[05:59] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: looks decent
[05:59] <niche> urlin2u, so when I have both HDDs installed and W7 HDD is top priority, is it going to ask me if I want to boot W7 or Ubuntu?
[05:59] <urlin2u> niche, windows first in bios will boot like it has a MS bootloader straight in. ;-)
[06:00] <urlin2u> like magic niche, ;-)
[06:00] <Nubnub> ello
[06:00] <flametai1> ActionParsnip, It is, but I'm unsure if it's possible to put Linux on. And have it operatable of course. Considering Linux can go onto anything.
[06:01] <flametai1> ActionParsnip, I saw a thread about it but people were saying the touch didn't work I believe.
[06:01] <niche> urlin2u, sweet, now what commands do I need to enter when I boot with the Live CD and open universe and terminal?
[06:01] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: put ubuntu on an SD card etc and boot to it, see how it goes
[06:01] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: assuming it can boot SD card
[06:01] <urlin2u> niche, so boot the 11.04 let me know if you want those instructions again
[06:01] <urlin2u> niche, open synaptic-settings-repositories first tab tick universe, close those windows leaving synaptic open hit reload then close sysnaptic and open a terminal.
[06:02] <ugly_duck> whats the panel called thats at the bottom of the screen, i love it but natty doesn't have it by default, i like seeing what apps are open all the time
[06:02] <flametai1> ActionParsnip, I suppose I could. Just didn't want to waste my time lol
[06:02] <niche> urlin2u, I don't understand. So after doing that and opening Terminal, lilo will be installed on my W7 HDD?
[06:02] <urlin2u> niche we will run one command after you load lilo.
[06:03] <ActionParsnip> ugly_duck: probably gnome-panel. Its lxpanel here :)
[06:03] <Nubnub> Can any one tell me How to get Compiz to work on Kubuntu? I have all of the packages Dl'd...
[06:03] <urlin2u> niche, just follow these instructions, I will cover you here. open synaptic-settings-repositories first tab tick universe, close those windows leaving synaptic open hit reload then close sysnaptic and open a terminal.
[06:03] <niche> kk I'm just going to boot and do that and get back into chat
[06:04] <flametai1> ActionParsnip, lxpanel? So you are not running Ubuntu then I assume?
[06:04] <urlin2u> niche, cool I will explain then the two commands after the instructions
[06:04] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: lxde is in the repos, it uses lxpanel
[06:04] <ugly_duck> ActionParsnip: thats not to bad actually..
[06:04] <ugly_duck> but this one only has the trash and thats it
[06:05] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: my desktop on my lappy: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8850924/Images/Desktop.png
[06:05] <ActionParsnip> ugly_duck: natty puts stuff on the top panel
[06:06] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: look nito lubuntu ;)
[06:06] <Nubnub> Aany1 Familiar with Kubuntu? and changing Window managers?
[06:06] <flametai1> ActionParsnip, ah, okay then. And oh very interesting! It's colorful :D Something my desktop is not aware of lol! And it sort of reminds me of Kubuntu.
[06:06] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: its a lot lighter, its very blue, not too jazzy
[06:06] <longjohn30> Nubnub: #kubuntu?
[06:07] <Nubnub> Newest
[06:07] <Nubnub> just installed 2 days ago
[06:07] <longjohn30> ActionParsnip: is your power consumption noticably lower with lxde as opposed to other distros?
[06:07] <Nubnub> dl'd and installed 2 days ago
[06:07] <longjohn30> s/lxde/lubuntu/
[06:07] <longjohn30> Nubnub: i'm saying your question would be better answered in #kubuntu
[06:07] <Nubnub> its the Wweb server version amd 64

[06:08] <Nubnub> o thanks
[06:08] <flametai1> ActionParsnip, my desktop that doesn't see color much :D lmao http://i51.tinypic.com/317gt8i.png
[06:09] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: looks groovy
[06:10] <flametai1> Also, ActionParsnip, LibreOffice, are those closer to microsoft office than OpenOffice? I've been looking for a replacement for Microsoft Office on Linux other than OpenOffice, it doesn't seem to cut it for me.
[06:10] <flametai1> And considering I need them as close as possible for college.
[06:10] <flametai1> It would be helpful to find it
[06:11] <SIFTU> flametai1: libreoffice is a fork of openoffice, so is very similar
[06:11] <flametai1> Ah okay.
[06:11] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: not sure what the difference is. I just use what's there. There are plenty of comparison sites talking about the differences
[06:12] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: tbh, I usually pull it off and just use abiword, I don't fully use openoffice so I save resources (makes a faster pc :))
=== evil is now known as Guest1303
[06:13] <linuxuz3r_> sup
[06:13] <urlin2u> ActionParsnip, I like the no format option in abiword, works in capture off the web the others wont.
[06:13] <Snicers-Home> Does IE9 support SNI?
[06:13] <urlin2u> no fromat paste*
[06:13] <flametai1> ActionParsnip, faster pc is always good :)
[06:13] <ActionParsnip> Snicers-Home: IE9 isnt an ubuntu app so is offtopic here
[06:14] <ActionParsnip> flametai1: I need it, all my sysyems are old
[06:14] <linuxuz3r_> Snicers-Home, try #windows
[06:15] <speedrunnerG55> help i forgot how to turn on drivers
[06:16] <flametai1> I know that all too well, I used to run on a machine with only 128mb ram. I'm currently only running 2gns of ram and AMD Athlon processor 2.1Ghz
[06:16] <flametai1> gbs* well the heck with my typo's tonight.
[06:17] <speedrunnerG55> (whi isnt it in aditional drivers?)
[06:17] <urlin2u> speedrunnerG55, name the graphic card?
[06:17] <speedrunnerG55> nvidia gforce 6200
[06:17] <urlin2u> speedrunnerG55, help will arrive. ;-)
[06:17] <speedrunnerG55> i had it working before, but i removed the driver and reinstalled it, now its not in use
[06:17] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, I'm back
[06:18] <ActionParsnip> speedrunnerG55: sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[06:18] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, col you want the instructions again.
[06:18] <niche-LiveCD> nah I remember
[06:18] <urlin2u> cool niche,
[06:19] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, however, I do not remember how to open synaptic-settings-repositories
[06:19] <speedrunnerG55> ok do i have to restart now?
[06:19] <niche-LiveCD> or I should say ever known
[06:19] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, click the applications button and open synaptic
[06:19] <flametai1> Also, ActionParsnip, I have no SD cards so I am going to attempt it with a USB boot
[06:20] <niche-LiveCD> package manager?
[06:20] <niche-LiveCD> mo'K
[06:20] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, search with synaptic then open
[06:20] <speedrunnerG55> it still says its not in use, should i restart?
[06:20] <Tophen> I'm at the final stage of my problem... But I need help with one more thing...
[06:21] <speedrunnerG55> 0_0
[06:21] <Tophen> I'm on a MacBook with BootCamp (don't have admin; it's school laptop) and the bios can't be accessed.
[06:21] <greg3000> So I've got an amd phenom II 4-core box and it's having trouble booting ubuntu.  Trouble started after an upgrade to 11.04, but I just downloaded a copy of ubuntu server 64bit, burned it to CD, and this system still reboots near the start of the boot-up sequence.
[06:21] <speedrunnerG55> imah try to reboot.
[06:21] <Tophen> Could I put a bios ISO on a cd and then choose to run off my ehd?
[06:21] <speedrunnerG55> ill come back if there is still anny issues
[06:21] <urlin2u> brave soul
[06:22] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, not finding anything in synaptic package manager that says universe
[06:22] <niche-LiveCD> where should I be looking
[06:22] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, synaptic-settings-repositories first tab tick universe, close those windows leaving synaptic open hit reload then close sysnaptic and open a terminal.
[06:23] <rawfodog> my icons wont minimize to the tray. I've deleted the top panel, and moved everything to the bottem. I've included INDICATOR APPLET ALL. Why wont things show up in the systems tray ?
[06:23] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, your not searching in synaptic but opening these in the top panel
[06:24] <rawfodog> NEVERMIND, it's because I didnt add "Notification container"
[06:25] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, so you want me to Un-tick Community-maintained Open Source Software (universe) ?
[06:26] <rawfodog> I take that back. XCHAT still wont show up in the minimized tray
[06:26] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, don't untick anything first tab at the top far left 2nd line universe tick on.
[06:27] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, it already had a checkmark then. What do I need to do now
[06:27] <rawfodog> When I 'x' out of xchat it asks "minimize to tray ?". I won't show in the tray when I minimize it.  I look at the processes and it's still running. It's in the tray right now, but I didn't close it
[06:27] <speedrunnerG55> its still isnt in use
[06:27] <speedrunnerG55> i thought there was a way to turn it on but i dont remember
[06:27] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, close those windows leave synaptic open and hit reload let it run then close it and open a terminal.
[06:27] <rawfodog> There is, it asks me and I say yes
[06:28] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, roger, ready for next step
[06:28] <speedrunnerG55> were?
[06:28] <rawfodog> It used to work before I went customizing the panels
[06:28] <maheanuu> Does anyone here know where I can find manuals for ubuntu and terminal command usage etc  in French.  I have installed 11.04 on my grandsons and daughters computers and they are very much needing instructions in their mother tongue, any help would be greatly appreciated
[06:28] <glebihan> rawfodog, did you restart xchat ?
[06:28] <rawfodog> many times
[06:28] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, so where are yo at.
[06:28] <urlin2u> you
[06:28] <niche-LiveCD> Terminal
[06:28] <rawfodog> Its in the minimize panel now, but the program window is active
[06:28] <urlin2u> lets just for being care run the sudo fdisk -l to make sure sdb is still the windows drive
[06:29] <speedrunnerG55> can i at least know here it is?
[06:29] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, look above
[06:29] <rawfodog> The second I ex it out, it SHOULD be in the panel, the process manager shows it is running, and on default gnome set up it would still show.
[06:29] <rawfodog> For me however, after deleteing the panel and putting everying into one panel, it doesn't show
[06:29] <speedrunnerG55> like a general idea of where i can find it?
[06:29] <speedrunnerG55> i dont know why it wouldnt be right in aditional drivers,
[06:30] <speedrunnerG55> its like i have to go on a scavenger hunt
[06:30] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, sda2 is my W7 partition
[06:30] <speedrunnerG55> :(
[06:30] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, are you sure the script said sdb hd.
[06:30] <speedrunnerG55> i know i did it before
[06:30] <maheanuu> And for me I am having a problem when I open anything in places instead of opening documents I bring up a picture etc

[06:33] <speedrunnerG55> its not in use
[06:33] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, kk if you say so!
[06:34] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, yes you ran the reload in synaptic correct?
[06:34] <GoodAD> ubuntu = virus stuxnet ?
[06:34] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, yes I did
[06:34] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, cool here is a link with two commands run both and your set hold on, I will pastebin it.
[06:34]  * speedrunnerG55 pokes i42n
[06:35] <i42n> speedrunnerG55: You can not use Unity? Or do you just want to have 3D accelleration?
[06:35] <speedrunnerG55> i want 3d acseleration, i dont like unity
[06:35] <GoodAD> Virus Stuxnet = Ubuntu ?
[06:36] <i42n> What Graphics Card do you use?
[06:36] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, http://paste.ubuntu.com/667976/
[06:37] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, run the commands individually in that order.
[06:37] <speedrunnerG55> i use an nvidea force 6200
[06:37] <maheanuu> speedrunner if you log out and look below your user name you can load 11.04 in classic and it will be like 10.10 as far as using gnome
[06:38] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, says I have to run liloconfig(8) when process is completed or it won't work
[06:38] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, is that still ok?
[06:38] <i42n> speedrunnerG55: go to system menu and look for something like restricted drivers.
[06:38] <speedrunnerG55> i know
[06:38] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, ignore that as the link says
[06:38] <niche-LiveCD> kk
[06:38] <speedrunnerG55> ok ill try that
[06:39] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, only error you will ever love. ;-)
[06:39] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, lol. Alright well it's time to test it out
[06:39] <maheanuu> speedrunner, I also think that unity sux
[06:39] <speedrunnerG55> i couldnt fiind that
[06:39] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, yeah you should be able to boot windows from grub and that HD now.
[06:40] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u,  won't be back on if it works, wife is about to kill me now. Thanks so much, I'm grateful for your help I would be lost without it!
[06:40] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, no problem you want gthe one command from a windows disc to replace lilo if you want
[06:40] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, sure
[06:41] <speedrunnerG55> there is aditional drivers but its only tlling me its not in use
[06:41] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, bootrec.exe /fixmbr
[06:41]  * speedrunnerG55 cries
[06:41] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, from the repair terminal on booted windows disc.
[06:41] <speedrunnerG55> i was onlly doing as my a+ book told me to
[06:42] <KE1HA> I asked over in ubuntu-server but nobody's home it seems, is there any known problem / bugs with Ubuntu 11.04-Server and Samba, Ive' been trying for hours to setup a simple share, even with SWAT ans still no joy.
[06:42] <niche-LiveCD> urlin2u, great. Saved for future reference. Thanks again
[06:42] <speedrunnerG55> i dont know hat to do
[06:42] <i42n> speedrunnerG55: I think that's the correct settings window. Try to enable the graphics driver there.
[06:42] <urlin2u> niche-LiveCD, no problem glad we got here. ;-)
[06:42] <speedrunnerG55> there isnt a wayt, its activated but "not in use"
[06:43] <maheanuu> speed what are you trying to do?
[06:43] <speedrunnerG55> make it be in use
[06:44] <maheanuu> I read back but not seeing what you are trying to do
[06:44] <i42n> speedrunnerG55: did you modify your /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
[06:45] <brubelsabs> What should I check if I get an "no such file or directory" when executing an _existing_ file with _proper_ permissions on an ext4 partition?
[06:45] <brubelsabs> its not a symlink
[06:45] <brubelsabs> the file is real there
[06:45] <brubelsabs> having right permissions
[06:46] <speedrunnerG55> i removed the driver, because i removed a simmilar card and put a new one in thinking i should get a new driver for it
[06:46] <nighter> brubelsabs: you execute the file with ./filename ? I mean so you are sure the file execute from your PATH.
[06:46] <brubelsabs> nighter:  Yes I execute it with ./lmutils
[06:46] <nighter> brubelsabs: file ./lmutils
[06:46] <Niche> Just logging on to say it works perfectly! Woooo woooo!
[06:47] <i42n> speedrunnerG55: How did you remove it?
[06:47]  * Niche does a dance while holding a trout
[06:47] <speedrunnerG55> in aditional driver, i clicked remove
[06:47] <brubelsabs> ELF 64-bit binary
[06:47] <i42n> speedrunnerG55: ok, and now you can not install it again.
[06:47] <brubelsabs> even strace gave me the hint that some file was not found
[06:47] <i42n> hm
[06:48] <Karen_m> new laptop, sound does not work.  Any ideas?
[06:48] <brubelsabs> strace lmutil
[06:48] <brubelsabs> execve("./lmutil", ["lmutil"], [/* 110 vars */]) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[06:48] <speedrunnerG55> i did, but its not in use
[06:49] <i42n> speedrunnerG55: oh ok. do you have a config manager of nvidia installed? it should come with the driver.
[06:50] <brubelsabs> mountoptions: /dev/sda3 on /local type ext4 (rw,relatime,user_xattr,acl,barrier=1,data=ordered)
[06:50] <speedrunnerG55> config manager? there is a configuration tool thingu in administration

[06:52] <eviscares> Good morning, does someone know whether I can coax apt-get to download an older version of a package from a ppa?
[06:52] <speedrunnerG55> idk
[06:52] <speedrunnerG55> where would that be? in the home folder as a .somehting?
[06:52] <popey> eviscares: apt-get install packagename=1.2.3.4
[06:52] <popey> eviscares: where 1.2.3.4 is the version number
[06:52] <urlin2u> eviscares, sure be careful no other are installed watxh the dependencies
[06:52] <dzup> how do i reinstall all gnome related back to original values, all, i can not play flash in firefox, chrome, opera, i try purge and so on, i need to reinstall all gnome with al /etc /usr/etc files ...any ideas?
[06:52] <urlin2u> watch*
[06:53] <i42n> speedrunnerG55: for me its in system menu. like synaptic etc.
[06:53] <eviscares> urlin2u: but how can I force him to take an older version? In the repo I use the newest version is 1.4, but I need 1.3 cause 1.4 is still too buggy
[06:54] <speedrunnerG55> there isnt annything in my system menue exept other options

[06:54] <Dan18> Hello, when does Rump1 usually join in?
[06:54] <brubelsabs> yes
[06:55] <brubelsabs> it was solved now by installing lsb-core
[06:55] <urlin2u> eviscares, put the ppa in sources.list with the concurrent release of that package, run a update, install then put a # in front of the ppa in the sources list
[06:55] <i42n> speedrunnerG55: what about opening a terminal and entering nvidia. then douvle press tab. anything there?
[06:55] <brubelsabs> but this is very uninformative :)
[06:55] <brubelsabs> I meant the error message
[06:55] <brubelsabs> but once again a good google search phrase did it :D
[06:56] <eviscares> urlin2u:  that might work. thanks
[06:56] <urlin2u> eviscares, did you look on the web for a deb of the package first?
[06:56] <brubelsabs> nighter:  bye
[06:56] <urlin2u> eviscares, you could down load the tar if one there or a deb.
[06:56] <speedrunnerG55> idk what all this is

[07:12] <SauceFace> urlin2u: I have not with this hardware. That is a bummer, I am one of the few that actually likes unity. Is 10.04 too much different

[07:13] <urlin2u> SauceFace, don't take my word here though.

[07:14] <lewis93> I was playing with Ubuntu Tweak and then my laptop shutdown - now I can't see the launcher or the bar at the top. How do I reverse this?
[07:14] <bazhang> lewis93, ubuntu tweak? installed from where
[07:14] <urlin2u> Lewis29, what were you doing in the tweak?
[07:14] <gskelling> can someone help me get php-gtk working? It seems to install right, and the demo loads up fine, but when I run phoronix test suite with gui (gtk-php app) nothing happens
[07:15] <lewis93> bazhang, I can't remember; I'd go in my history and paste the link but I can't get to a browser.

[07:15] <zamba> is it possible to set up symantec netbackup on ubuntu?
[07:16] <ikonia> zamba: yes, but if you are using 64bit it's a very VERY dirty hack, 32bit is less
[07:16] <gskelling> anyone? the people in #php-gtk are all idle
[07:16] <ikonia> gskelling: not really something we support
[07:16] <urlin2u> Lewis29, in the termoinal ubuntu-tweak and it will open
[07:16] <gskelling> I see
[07:17] <gskelling> it has a couple of ubuntu only related issues
[07:17] <gskelling> so I thought i'd try
[07:17] <urlin2u> Lewis29, same fro firefox
[07:17] <urlin2u> for
[07:17] <ikonia> gskelling: how is it ubuntu related ?
[07:17] <gskelling> ikonia, just the issues during install
[07:17] <zamba> ikonia: tell me about it :)
[07:17] <gskelling> installing it on ubuntu requires a few extra steps
[07:17] <gskelling> vs other linux distros
[07:17] <zamba> ikonia: and i'm of course running 64-bit :)
[07:17] <gskelling> at least thats what I think
[07:18] <ikonia> gskelling: what issue during install
[07:18] <ikonia> zamba: the honest answer is, even symatic don't support it (I know their website says they do) but they don't support anything beyond 8.04 due to the dirty hacks,
[07:18] <gskelling> ikonia, in this one tutorial I found for php-gtk on ubuntu it says "We need to patch the PHP-GTK source because Ubuntu is using a version of libtool which appears to be different than what other distributions are using."
[07:18] <evil_> i lose mine secret key,how could i find it?
[07:18] <urlin2u> Lewis29, if you installed from the terminal history, and ctrl-alt-t opens a terminal
[07:18] <zamba> ikonia: well, give me the dishonest answer then :)
[07:18] <ikonia> gskelling: I thought php-gtk was already in the repos
[07:19] <ikonia> zamba: "yes, it's fully supported by symantec and works out of the box"
[07:19] <gskelling> ikonia, I don't think so...

[07:21] <wisevoyager> Hi! does anyone know how to fix this problem http://pastebin.com/cxKtyvB0 Thank you in advanced for any helps.,
[07:21] <ikonia> gskelling: sounds like the app is a problem, either as an application or as a compatible application iwth the version ubuntu packages
[07:22] <lewis93> bazhang, this is where I downloaded the tweak
[07:22] <urlin2u> Lewis29, I would log out then back in, maybe to the classic if needed.
[07:22] <gskelling> the app however IS supported in the ubuntu repos.. =\
[07:22] <babaei> !fa
[07:22] <gskelling> just requires php-gtk to run the gui

[07:22] <livingdaylight> Anyone familiar familiar with subsonic? just dl it but do not see it anywhere in menu. Alt+F2 and "subsonic" doesn't launch it either. Anyone?

[07:22] <gskelling> livingdaylight, hold on
[07:23] <gskelling> ikonia, phoronix test suite
[07:23] <ikonia> gskelling: I'm not aware of it
[07:23] <viktor35> i love you)
[07:23] <gskelling> livingdaylight, subsonic can be accessed with a browser. Point the IP address to 127.0.0.1 and whatever port you set
[07:23] <ikonia> wisevoyager: it would appear that package is not packaged correctly, where did you get it ?
[07:23] <urlin2u> livingdaylight, how did you install?
[07:23] <rww> viktor35: #ubuntu is for Ubuntu technical support only, thanks.
[07:23] <bazhang> viktor35, did you have an ubuntu support question?
[07:24] <wisevoyager> ikonia, I'm using Backbox linux 10.04 lucid lynx
[07:24] <livingdaylight> urlin2u, I was going to from getdeb, but went to the subsonic Homepage and dl from there. Navigated to Downloads in Terminal and installed it with sudo dpkg -i
[07:24] <ikonia> wisevoyager: that's not something we support here, we only support ubuntu here
[07:25] <Rouse> viktor35, this is not place to express your personal issues
[07:25] <urlin2u> livingdaylight, gskelling, has an answer
[07:26] <wisevoyager> ikonia: I'm using ubuntu 10.04 backbox version..
[07:26] <livingdaylight> urlin2u, livingdaylight@pebble:~$ subsonic Started Subsonic [PID 2408, /var/subsonic/subsonic_sh.log]

[07:26] <bazhang> wisevoyager, blackbox? or backtrack
[07:26] <livingdaylight> gskellig, just ping me when you're ready - thanks in advance
[07:27] <urlin2u> livingdaylight, I wouldn't know without installing and messing around with it.
[07:27] <nessonic> any idea what would cause an ssh login (before password) to hang until a timeout?
[07:27] <wisevoyager> bazhang, backbox linux
[07:27] <gskelling> livingdaylight, its running but can only be accessed with a web browser.
[07:27] <livingdaylight> urlin2u, no worries
[07:27] <livingdaylight> gskellig, I see!
[07:27] <gskelling> livingdaylight, I can't remember what the default port is for subsonic, I'm looking it up now
[07:28] <livingdaylight> gskellig, so, need to go to FF and open an account
[07:28] <gskelling> livingdaylight, it should be able to be accessed by opening a web browser and pointing it to http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost:4040
[07:28] <gskelling> yeah
[07:28] <bazhang> wisevoyager, that's not supported here try alis for their support channel
[07:28] <popey> wisevoyager: backbox is not supported here. it's not an official version of Ubuntu.

[07:30] <wisevoyager> bazhang, thanks..
[07:30] <livingdaylight> gskellig, sorry, about that. I'll dig in there and see if I can figure it out. I did think it was a great idea but rather more straightforward than that. Not sure working through a browser is a great solution
[07:30] <HSarena> urlin2u : i upgrade my ubuntu but, i can't use unity yet
[07:31] <gskelling> livingdaylight, its not made to be a normal media player, its meant to be able to stream your music collection to any computer/smartphone in the world instantly
[07:31] <gskelling> its a media server application
[07:31] <urlin2u> HSarena, was it a graphic card driver issue as I remember?

However, my client got "size-mismatch", after issuing apt-get. What mistake have I made in the process ?
[07:33] <urlin2u> ;-)
[07:33] <gskelling> livingdaylight, once you can access the subsonic web interface, you can do everything from there. its like setting up a router
[07:33] <gskelling> just click settings =P

[07:39] <livingdaylight> *web
[07:39] <urlin2u> HSarena, log into the classic you can choose it at login, in the menu is a application called additional drivers. You want to run a update and upgrade first though.
[07:39] <dzup> or should i reinstall?
[07:39] <gskelling> livingdaylight, typing http://localhost didn't work? or http://localhost:4040

[07:40] <flametai1> Hey guys, quick question, is there a difference between Wine and WineHQ? o.O WineHQ is just Wine's official site correct? Or is there actually another Wine called WineHQ? Was reading a forum and someone mentioned to try "WineHQ" but never clarified what they meant.
[07:40] <bazhang> dzup, more importantly , got a separate /home partition?
[07:40] <livingdaylight> gskellig, ok, lol
[07:40] <gskelling> it's a website hosted on your computer.

[07:44] <urlin2u> HSarena, this is where I can't really help, so we are farther along though as far as important info others would probably need to help.
[07:44] <Axlin> filsuf: Should be ctrl-shift-pgup/pgdown
[07:44] <rethus1> fdisk only change partition-table... seems nbot to erase all given data on it

[07:45] <stowoda> hi, my lower panel is auto hided and wont show up again.. How can i fix this?
[07:45] <gskelling> livingdaylight, I can't remember, like I said I haven't used it in awhile. If you're at the web interface you're on the right track though. Remember the point of subsonic is to share your music with any computer in the world, so a username and password are a good idea to prevent any random stranger from getting to it
[07:46] <dzup> bazhang: if i apt-get --purge gnome ...and the reinstall it will erase all those "custom" systemwide modifications i made erlier?
[07:46] <gskelling> livingdaylight, if I remember their website is pretty helpful, they have a good FAQ section and some decent walkthroughs
[07:46] <Axlin> filsuf: When you say "Konsole", are you referring to GNOME/Unity, or KDE?
[07:46] <rww> Axlin: Konsole is the KDE terminal emulator
[07:46] <pyarun> hey, need help with dir permessions..i have a parent dir P to whichi have given some recursive permissions which are applied to sub-dir s1. Now i create a new sub-dir s2, is there any way that child dir takes the permission of parent dir

[07:46] <drussell> rethus1: try a command called "shred"
[07:46] <bazhang> dzup, no, not sure what you modified however
[07:47] <Axlin> filsuf: Thought so. You should be able to go into Settings->Shortcuts, to see what it's assigned to.
[07:47] <rethus> how secure is erase th hdd on this way? Is there a way to restore the data?
[07:47] <dzup> bazhang: you know a way to get defaults values back into gnome?
=== gskelling is now known as Gskellig
[07:48] <drussell> rethus: it's very secure
[07:48] <rethus> or is it better to rewrite each sector of the hdd with dd if=/dev/zero /dev/sdb ?
[07:48] <drussell> rethus: no, that's not very secure
[07:48] <drussell> rethus: if you look up shred you'll see it overwrites the area multiple times
[07:49] <drussell> rethus: making recovery nearly impossible
[07:49] <stowoda> oh, :) this helped me, especially post #16: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1201800&page=2

[08:02] <drussell> rethus: then there's pretty much nothing you can do, apart from run a check for badblocks on a regular basis
[08:05] <urlin2u> jose__, best is relative to any user, clonezilla will image the whole thing. You can also save a file of all installed apps and the source list, other methods as well, I use these.

[08:15] <overclucker> rww: i'm a chicken
[08:15] <urlin2u> atdprhs, the os-prober is what searches for other OS's so in the external terminal sudo apt-get remove os-prober.
[08:15] <ryry> anyon know the terminal command that updates everything.is it apt-get?
[08:16] <zabomber> Could not access /dropbox/ (not WebDAV-enabled?):

[08:16] <atdprhs> can I edit it manually?
[08:17] <urlin2u> atdprhs, probably, but more risky, when all you have to do is reinstall t.
[08:17] <urlin2u> it*
[08:17] <atdprhs> urlin2u, I removed it
[08:18] <urlin2u> atdprhs, now run sudo update-grub and that OS will only be in its grun menu

[08:28] <a-skibbedy-bap> Is it possible to get Unity on the latest LTS release?
[08:28] <Lasers> !version | dan_
[08:28] <ubottu> dan_: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type « lsb_release -a » in a !shell - To know the available version of a package, « apt-cache policy <package> »
[08:29] <dan_> a-skibbedy-bap, yeah, i had a message asking if i wanted to update to the latest distro
[08:29] <LotusFeet> I'm trying to run a Totem Movie Player 2.32.0 playlist on startup but i cant figure out how to add the playlist to startup nor how to fullscreen the app (all i know is fullscreen hotkey is F11)
[08:29] <a-skibbedy-bap> a-skibbedy-bap: What do you mean
[08:29] <dan_> but i said ask me later, but i cant seem to find out how to get it back now
[08:30] <absence> urlin2u: it says no is the "simple answer", do you know the details?
[08:30] <dan_> but it said i mean^

[08:31] <Halabund> What tex/latex packages do I need to install in Ubuntu to get scalable (non-bitmap) euler/concrete fonts, like here?  http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/ccr/   In MiKTeX the default seems to be scalable fonts.
[08:32] <dan_> urlin2u, thanks sorted it
[08:32] <urlin2u> dan_, then run a update in the update manager should show the upgrade make sure you are fully upgraded
[08:32] <rawfodog> What is GNOME Keyring: PKCS# Component ?
[08:32] <rawfodog> It's in my start up
[08:32] <absence> urlin2u: are there any other ways to install linux on a system with windows software raid?
[08:32] <rawfodog> and I want to remove it. Will it mess up the OS ?
[08:33] <absence> urlin2u: any way at all, i mean :)
[08:33] <urlin2u> absence, not sure you could run a virtual, and a wubi probably works not sure there though, or a bootable external.
[08:34] <dan_> urlin2u, its only showing version 10.10 for some reason :/

[08:35] <auronandace> dan_: you can only update one release at a time
[08:35] <urlin2u> dan_, the upgrades from 10.04 go release to release I believe,I always fresh install it is faster if you know how to et set up
[08:35] <urlin2u> get*
[08:35] <auronandace> dan_: it is much easier and cleaner to fresh install
[08:36] <dan_> yeah ok ill just download the latest one and install that way
[08:36] <somebears> hi :) I want to install a programm into /usr/local/bin instead of my home directory (default). But I dont have the permissions to do so. Should I istall it with sudo or change the permissions of /usr/local/bin
[08:36] <dan_> thanks for the help anyway
=== fr0sted is now known as fr0sted-bnc
[08:36] <urlin2u> dan_, you can clone the lucid to in case you have problems.
[08:36] <Razzeeyy> somebears sudo is the best solution
[08:37] <Lasers> somebears: What program?
[08:37] <somebears> Rezzeeyy: will I have problems with permissions later? like updates or changes in the config file
[08:38] <somebears> razzeeyy*
[08:38] <LotusFeet> I figured out the Totem Movie Player issue myself =P thanks for leaving it to me, learned more that wayu
[08:39] <Lasers> somebears: "mkdir -p ~/bin && mv ~/lame-screensaver.bin ~/bin" -- That can work too. (or /usr/local/bin)
[08:39] <Razzeeyy> somebears, depends on what tthe programm is do. But you always free to change permissions
[08:40] <somebears> hmmm im just gonna try it :) thank you
[08:40] <Razzeeyy> offtop: guys how to enter #openbox channel? it says that i'm needed to be invited

[08:42] <thebrasse> Hi! If I want to test this kernel: http://people.canonical.com/~lexical/bugs/lp791752/, I guess that I install the debs with dpkg. But how do I get back to the kerel I have installed now (the latest from the ubuntu repo)?
[08:43] <Razzeeyy> urlin2u, :D but can i place question about openbox here? (in case it's not default part of ubuntu)
[08:43] <Haematoma> Hey guys
[08:43] <Haematoma> Anyone up?
[08:43] <urlin2u> Razzeeyy, I don't care myself. ;-)
[08:43] <Haematoma> I have issues with system slow down whenever moving or resizing windows
[08:43] <Haematoma> I have an e5200 processor, which runs at a higher clock speed and has more l2 cache than my laptop
[08:44] <Haematoma> yet my laptop performs better on ubuntu, no slowdowns while moving or resizing windows
[08:44] <Razzeeyy> Haematome, i think you should look into compiz about that problem
[08:44] <Razzeeyy> *Haematoma
[08:44] <Haematoma> compiz?
[08:44] <Sebo> Hi!
[08:44] <Haematoma> isn't that a third party window manager?
[08:44] <Sebo> Can you tell me how to make /etc/init/*.conf auto respawning job not to respawn if the main process ended while pre-stop is running?
[08:45] <Haematoma> Razzeeyy, Isn't compiz a third party window manager?
[08:46] <archman> hello
[08:46] <Razzeeyy> i was having the same problems when moving windows when unity just came up. due to system monitor the problem was in compiz (about 20%) problem was fixed after update
[08:46] <Razzeeyy> yes compiz is a window manager. default in unity
[08:46] <Haematoma> ahh
[08:46] <archman> i'm trying to use tuxonice to hibernate, but the built in stuff with pm-utils doesn't work, so i'm trying out "hibernate". what is the proper way to add "resume=...." to the grub.cfg?
[08:46] <Haematoma> so how did you end up fixing it?
[08:46] <Haematoma> restart?
[08:46] <Haematoma> update?
[08:47] <Razzeeyy> update
[08:47] <Razzeeyy> fix came up with system update
[08:47] <Razzeeyy> or google for it if it's not
[08:49] <Razzeeyy> Guys I'm using openbox + trayer. Is there any way to prevent trayer minimize? Looked in openbox per-app settings but there is no such function. Anyone can give any good ideas?
[08:49] <Haematoma> hmm, well notify-osd isn't functioning correctly, so I wonder if that has something to do with it
[08:51] <archman> ok, fixed
[08:51] <archman> does anyone know how to fix the menu which is used when the power button is pressed so it uses different stuff for hibernation?
