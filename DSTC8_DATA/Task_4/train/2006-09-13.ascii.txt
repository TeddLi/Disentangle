[07:19] <toaks> so why would there not be a root user created on install?
[07:19] <total_meltdown> I was thinking of 'Don't tell him about sudo'
[07:19] <toaks> isnt that a bit strange?
[07:19] <clarence> Healot: no i dont but i got wine installed
[07:19] <total_meltdown> toaks: It's a security bonus. Typing 'sudo' every time makes you think about what you're doing before you go and type 'rm -rf /*' into a root shell
[07:19] <toaks> fair enuf.
[07:20] <total_meltdown> You get used to it fairly quickly

[08:25] <MTecknology> mkquist, no, part was formatted
[08:25] <mkquist> MTecknology - but after windows right?
[08:25] <mneptok> MTecknology: if you resized partitions, there is a very good chance that your Linux installtion is gone. which means you *will* be installing it again.

[08:26] <total_meltdown> alex222: I dunno. I've used KDE and Gnome, and I just like how integrated KDE is. Like, the other day I pressed PrtSc, KSnapShot popped up, and I saved the screenshot directly to my FTP server so I could post it on my forums
[08:26] <mkquist> mneptok - he was trying to install grub as a work aroung to start windows when the windows install cd didnt work to restore
[08:26] <_X-ray_> oh well... meanwhile I'm having a good time listening to Altar :D
[08:26] <total_meltdown> alex222: and I was uploading pictures to facebook directly from my FTP server as well
[08:26] <MTecknology> mneptok mkquist , I formatted the linux partition to NTFS I have a seperate partition set aside, now, to install grub to
[08:26] <dcstimm> configure: error: No curses header-files found
[08:27] <total_meltdown> alex222: It's little integration things like that I like
[08:27] <dcstimm> any one know what package I need?
[08:27] <total_meltdown> plus it's HAWT!
[08:27] <dcstimm> any one know what package I need? configure: error: No curses header-files found
[08:27] <atroWork> MTecknology, if you just need to write an MBR I can help you work with grub's command line. The menu.lst file for grub will have to be accurate, and you'll have to know the device you want to write the MBR to
[08:27] <mneptok> MTecknology: if you want to restore a Windows MBR just boot the Windows CD to a recovery shell and type "fdisk /mbr"
[08:27] <TeePOG> the only bits i love in KDE, are: 1. Katapult, and 2. the public file server applet
[08:27] <kintaro0e> hi guys..whats the difference of the "search foo.com" and "domain foo.com" in the resolv.conf
[08:27] <mkquist> mneptok- he says that the windows disc errors out saying no hard drive installed
[08:27] <total_meltdown> dcstimm: apt-cache search curses | grep lib
[08:27] <MTecknology> mneptok, i can't get to the command line - windows cd doesn't recognise HD

[08:28] <mkquist> MTecknology, mneptok -could the part need to be set to active?

[08:28] <mneptok> MTecknology: if that drive is failing, every second it is pluggen in brings you closer to datapoof
[08:29] <MTecknology> mneptok, because of driver - i need a 3rd party driver that i don't have
[08:29] <atroWork> MTecknology, with the live CD you should be able to mount the existing partitions, grab your own menu.lst and copy it over

[08:35] <Lard-O-Lad> britt: manually install grub eh, that sounds harder than it might actually be...
[08:35] <_X-ray_> shit
[08:36] <total_meltdown> you can apt it though

[08:38] <orphean> _X-ray_: kubuntu is basically the same as ubuntu except it uses KDE instead of gnome.
[08:38] <tamacracker> i saw screen shots of ubuntu
[08:38] <total_meltdown> _X-ray_ They're exactly the same AFAIK, but Kubuntu comes with KDE, Ubuntu comes with Gnome
[08:38] <orphean> you can turn ubuntu into kubuntu just by installing kde ;)
[08:38] <_X-ray_> grat
[08:38] <tamacracker> and thought... shit this is as good if not better than xp
[08:38] <_X-ray_> great*
[08:38] <irawan> _X-ray_: it is your preference
[08:38] <britt> run grub, find out what 'disk' your pc calls the USB stick, type in root hd(x,x) (0,0) for /dev/hda1 and then setup hd(x,x) and install i think
[08:39] <_X-ray_> but I want to edit php files in a easy and good way
[08:39] <tamacracker> what's the difference between gnome and kde? just the file system or something? or the GUI?
[08:39] <CromagDK> nano :D
[08:39] <tamacracker> I'm pretty ignorant with linux
[08:39] <britt> tamacracker: GUI
[08:39] <toaks> where would i be able to get the source for ubuntu from? - can i use apt get
[08:39] <orphean> tamacracker: different ways of doing things.  KDE tends to go more for 'feature packed' while gnome is focused on ease of use.
[08:39] <britt> gnome is for people who like thier coffee hot
[08:39] <_X-ray_> gui is stunning in ubuntu 6.0.6

[08:39] <toaks> i have kernel 2.6.12-9-386

[08:40] <tamacracker> it's better than xp in my point of view

[08:40] <jpiccolo> is it easy to upgrade to edgy
[08:40] <tamacracker> lol meltdown... me too
[08:41] <total_meltdown> Let's have an updated kernel party!
[08:41] <_X-ray_> jpiccolo, how?
[08:41] <total_meltdown> *party*
[08:41] <tamacracker> XP theme sucked up too much power
[08:41] <tamacracker> during loading

[08:41] <Nul1> not on my computer
[08:41] <Nul1> it costs me nothing
[08:41] <_X-ray_> LOL orphean why didn't you tell me be4? :D
[08:41] <jpiccolo> or will it be easy to upgrade from drapper to edgy?

[08:46] <britt> Nul1: a nuke will definately
[08:46] <Healot> Nul1: you can use qtparted or gparted
[08:46] <Nul1> im gonna google that
[08:46] <orphean> I would stay away from parted
[08:46] <tamacracker> i like to keep my PC maintained... well atleast my operating system... does ubuntu have programs such as disk clean up and defragmenter?
[08:46] <orphean> and NTFS resizing
[08:46] <AbortD> partitionmagic works great
[08:46] <orphean> from personal disk-destroying experience.
[08:46] <total_meltdown> britt: I think it might be, but it's like running Windows ME. You -can- but when something breaks and you lose everything you care about, nobody will feel sorry for you
[08:46] <Healot> the liveCD has either qtparted (kubuntu) or gparted (ubuntu)
[08:46] <mneptok> tamacracker: ext3 rarely needs such things.
[08:47] <Nul1> i have gparted
[08:47] <britt> tamacracker: i dont think fragmentation is a problem

[08:47] <tamacracker> really?
[08:47] <skoenman> k
[08:47] <wastrel> qtparted worked for my ntfs - defrag first.
[08:47] <tamacracker> that's fuckin sweet
[08:47] <britt> thats why a journaled file system is so cool
[08:47] <tamacracker> forgive my language lol

[09:14] <DennyCrane> Adam: well its a bad idea because if you sent the code to someone else, it would most likely fail, as the gumph at the start is what tells the shell etc how to run the file, having (what I assume) your DE assosicate *.rb with the ruby binary in order to shortcut this is not a good idea
