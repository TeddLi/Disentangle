[04:09] <map> and it says hardware/software no to locing it
[04:09] <NeverHere> map is beyond my lack of expertise sorry
[04:09] <NeverHere> :p
[04:10] <map> thanks anyway pal
[04:11] <NeverHere> map when you plug in the ethernet you don't get anything either?
[04:11] <map> i do now
[04:11] <map> got wired
[04:11] <map> but i wanted to use it upstairs!
[04:11] <NeverHere> does it detect wifi? and not connect? or not detect it at all?
[04:12] <map> it doesnt list any networks at all..but iwconfig shows wlan0 as does ifconfig
[04:12] <map> and lspci --nnk says its using b43-pci-bridge
[04:12] <adv> bye 4 now...
[04:12] <NeverHere> map i suggest a usb wifi dongle from walmart ;)
[04:12] <map> hah :)
[04:12] <LicideWiiU> with usb: CBM in boot menu
[04:13] <LicideWiiU> tha?
[04:13] <LicideWiiU> that?
[04:15] <LicideWiiU> oh CBM looks like it, i thought i did it alrady x
[04:18] <lonejack> zykotick9, wilee-nilee , for your interest with 'gnome-system-tools' you can manage the user privileges on a system
[04:18] <wilee-nilee> LicideWiiU, What you may not know is there is a boot from menu that is outside of the bios, I use it, it is a par-session boot, the bios splash will tell you the key prompt generally, mine is f12, That is the easiest way to try various boots.
[04:21] <wilee-nilee> lonejack, I have never used a gui to manage these areas.
[04:25] <TechTonics> does anyone know how to remove a package if it was installed from the tarball?
[04:26] <NeverHere> TechTonics, did you install it with Make?
[04:26] <jpds> TechTonics: Yes, run make uninstall from the build directory.
[04:26] <TechTonics> yes i used to make
[04:27] <wilee-nilee> TechTonics, Did you read the read me?
[04:29] <mojtaba> Hi, could you please let me know what are the differences between different distros (except desktop environments like KDE, GNOME, UNITY, ...)? I mean why there is lots of distros?
[04:29] <TechTonics> there is no uninstall and the README has nothing to do with removing
[04:29] <jpds> TechTonics: Just run "make uninstall".
[04:29] <TechTonics> i'm trying to remove ruby 2.0 if that helps
[04:30] <NeverHere> TechTonics, sometimes you can do apt-get remove ruby
[04:30] <jpds> TechTonics: You did run "make install" to install it.
[04:30] <NeverHere> that might remove the package
[04:30] <jpds> NeverHere: Package might not even be installed.
[04:30] <patrick_> wow my experience so far with my Lenovo T531 on Ubuntu 13.04 has been piss poor.
[04:30] <map> mojtaba,  some you have to compile specifically for your machine which means its more complicated but also faster then
[04:30] <map> patrick_,  wireless?
[04:30] <TechTonics> jpds : yes i used make install
[04:31] <patrick_> nvidia happened to it.
[04:31] <map> ah
[04:31] <TechTonics> NeverHere : apt-get doesn't see i have installed
[04:31] <patrick_> Optimus. :(
[04:31] <TechTonics> jpds : make: *** No rule to make target `uninstall'.  Stop.
[04:31] <NeverHere> TechTonics, when you ran make install, did it tell you insuffiecent permissions?
[04:31] <Bergle> map: are programs you compile yourself really noticably faster than regular packaged ones?
[04:31] <patrick_> more like, Optimshit
[04:31] <TechTonics> nope  .. had to use sudo
[04:32] <jpds> mojtaba: Why are there a lot of distros? Because have different thoughts on how to do things.
[04:32] <zykotick9> TechTonics: using source tarballs, means there is no way other then what that tarball offers.  Why you might want to use "/msg ubottu checkinstall" for an alternative!
[04:32] <NeverHere> TechTonics, do nano MAKEFILE and search for something like uninstall or remove or similar then exit and do make <whatever>
[04:33] <jpds> mojtaba: Because people have different*

[04:34] <mojtaba> jpds: map: I can do what I want to do with every distro, cann't I?
[04:34] <map> modprobe -l l
[04:34] <map> oops
[04:34] <jpds> mojtaba: Erm, like some people think it's better to compile everything (Gentoo), while others prefer binary packages.

[04:40] <uuball_gabriel> Hi, I wanna to build a deb package of kernel debug info, but when i use "fakeroot debian/rules binary-generic skipdbg=false" , the result is "make: *** No rule to make target `binary-generic'.  Stop."
[04:40] <awc737> wtf ubuntu 13.04, how do you not have a working suspend or hibernate

[04:40] <awc737> i had debian installed for months, never had a problem.
[04:40] <wilee-nilee> doh
[04:40] <Ziber> If I have a server that is using a LAN IP as it's resolver (10.220.1.10) and 10.220.1.10 is using public DNS, shouldn't the first server be able to resolve stuff?
[04:40] <uuball_gabriel> what should i do ?
[04:40] <awc737> just installed ubuntu, closed the lid and put it in my bad
[04:40] <awc737> a few hours later to pull it out, damn near melting
[04:40] <awc737> i'll be damned if theres no internal damage

[04:40] <uuball_gabriel> what happend?
[04:40] <dr_willis> hibernate is disabled by default i belive
[04:41] <awc737> i want to throw something at ubuntu so bad

[04:41] <awc737> well that's a dangerous hazard
[04:41] <dr_willis> rant elsewhere.  we focus on support

[04:41] <awc737> if my keyboard melted would you support that
[04:42] <dr_willis> there are guides out on how to ensble hibernate
=== HisaoNakai_ is now known as HisaoNakai
[04:42] <Ziber> 10.220.1.50 uses 10.220.1.10 as it's nameserver. 10.220.1.10 uses public IPs for resolving. Shouldn't 10.220.1.50 be able to resolve? It's saying that it timed out...
[04:42] <awc737> dr_willis, it's dangerous to assume that everyone should know hibernate is disabled
[04:42] <awc737> especially coming from any other OS
[04:42] <awc737> if it had been there an  hour or two more, literally melted or caught fire
[04:43] <dr_willis> awc737:  rant in another channel. it wont help to do it here
[04:43] <dr_willis> or on the forums
[04:44] <NielsMkn> this sucks
[04:45] <dr_willis> !details
[04:45] <ubottu> Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[04:45] <Ziber> Anyone? resolv.conf issue?
[04:47] <dr_willis> Ziber:  askununtu.com may have some info on it. ive never had any issues  here.  or rarely see them mentioned here
[04:49] <patrick_> "I have a problem with nvidia optimus on Ubuntu 13.04..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do multimonitor support..., I get the following output: *turd emoticon* ..., but I expected it to do *not turd emoticon*"
[04:49] <JeffATL> i have jsut installed 12.04 on a gateway netbook with ati radeon and when i boot up i get a very scrambled screen; my mouse pointer is a yellow block about a half inch wide with some lines and dots in it.  if i manage to start e.g. firefox, the google page displays normally among all the mess but the text in the window title bar, tab, and the letters on the page to the right of the three round gray icons is messed up
[04:49] <dr_willis> !nomodeset
[04:49] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[04:51] <dr_willis> try the fglrx drivers on that pc  JeffATL ?
[04:51] <zykotick9> Ziber: modern ubuntu versions don't use resolv.conf
[04:52] <Ziber> zykotick9: ?
[04:53] <dr_willis> !resolv
[04:53] <zykotick9> Ziber: you want /etc/networks/interfaces i believe, but i don't know the details.
[04:53] <JeffATL> is there a way i can intercede at boot time to try nomodeset?
[04:53] <dr_willis> JeffATL: at the grub menu
[04:54] <dr_willis> i think the url above shows how exactly.
[04:55] <dr_willis> hold shift. get to grub editir with 'e'   change line to be  'noquiet nofb nosplash'   ..  or somthing like that
[04:55] <JeffATL> dr_willis: ok, i think i can follow that.  how can i effect a clean reboot, given that i can't figure out how from the screen?  or can i just hold down the power button and make it die?
[04:55] <dr_willis> oops.. add a nomodeset in there
[04:56] <dr_willis> hold power for a few sec   forces it off
[04:56] <dr_willis> alt ctrl f1  then alt ctrl del.. may reboot also
[04:56] <dr_willis> or ssh in and reboot
[04:57] <dr_willis> you may want to boot into tect mode and install ssh to make things easier.to debug
[04:57] <dr_willis> text mode
[04:57] <dr_willis> !text
[04:57] <ubottu> To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[04:58] <zykotick9> !resolv.conf > Ziber
[04:58] <ubottu> Ziber, please see my private message
[05:00] <Ziber> Ah, hm.
[05:00] <Ziber> It's 1am and I'm gonna head to bed. Thanks for that though.
[05:00] <sepero> dr_willis: what do i do to start my computer in 2d mode?
[05:02] <dr_willis> no such thing.. clarify what you mean.
[05:02] <JeffATL> ok - nomodeset cured the scrambling but my resolution is wrong - it's like i've got 4:3 stretched horizontally to 16:9
[05:03] <dr_willis> JeffATL: try the fglrx drivers
[05:03] <sepero> dr_willis: no such thing? dang dawg. you'z illin' my netbook yo  :)
[05:03] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, what kind of AMD card do you have?
[05:03] <wilee-nilee> JeffATL, Have you run a update in this process?
[05:04] <UnderSampled> I'm trying to open a windows share, so I went to smb://host.domain.com/share and put in my credentials into the auth box
[05:04]  * sepero gives dr_willis hugs
[05:04] <dr_willis> sepero:  if you want a lighter desktop install lubuntu-desktop
[05:04] <UnderSampled> then it gave the error :Failed to mount Windows share: Name not unique on network
[05:04] <Silver_Arrow> marvin@marvin-laptop:~/Desktop/qjoypad-4.1.0/src$ ./config

[05:04] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, run this in terminal lspci | grep VGA
[05:05] <Silver_Arrow> Anybody know where to find this package?
[05:05] <sepero> dr_willis: thanks man. i'm rockin' that lxpanel on openbox right now and it's niiice  :)
[05:05] <NeverHere> Silver_Arrow, try apt-get install libxtst*
[05:05] <UnderSampled> how am I suppose to resolve this?
[05:05] <JeffATL> wilee-nilee: no updates yet
[05:05] <dr_willis> Silver_Arrow:  search the repos?
[05:05] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, if you're using unity, hit the dash board icon and type in and search for terminal
[05:05] <NeverHere> Silver_Arrow, if too many replies don't install
[05:05] <JeffATL> Ari-Yang: thank you
[05:05] <wilee-nilee> JeffATL, run a update first to get caught up then identify the card>
[05:05] <dr_willis> !source
[05:05] <ubottu> You can easily fetch a package's source with apt-get. See: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
[05:06] <dr_willis> !compile
[05:06] <ubottu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first). Also read !checkinstall
[05:06] <Ari-Yang> wilee-nilee, him updating will take longer than 10sec to find out card info, lol
[05:06] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, so did you find out the card?...
[05:06] <Silver_Arrow> that did the trick
[05:06] <Silver_Arrow> I'm rustier than I though I was at this x_x
[05:07] <wilee-nilee> Ari-Yang, Ah thabnks for the reminder why I keep you ignored.
[05:07] <Ari-Yang> pardon?
[05:07] <JeffATL> says amd (nee ATI) RS690M (radeon X1200 series)
[05:08] <Ari-Yang> okay JeffATL, in the dash board search for software updater, open it, if there are updates install...
[05:08] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, then after if things are still out of whack, open up the dash board, search for software sources, go to the "additional drivers" tab of it, then select fglrx and hit apply, and after, update.
[05:09] <JeffATL> Ari-Yang: i assume i also need to find and edit my grub.conf to make the nomodeset persist
[05:11] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, if that's a command line, then I guess you'd edit /etc/default/grub file then
[05:11] <UnderSampled> I'm trying to open a windows share, so I went to smb://host.domain.com/share and put in my credentials into the auth box
[05:12] <UnderSampled> then it gave the error :Failed to mount Windows share: Name not unique on network
[05:12] <UnderSampled> how am I suppose to resolve this?
[05:12] <Ari-Yang> and then add it to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash " line
[05:12] <Cheekio> where does one report bugs?
[05:12] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, in terminal type gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub
[05:12] <Cheekio> is there a #ubuntu-bugs
[05:12] <Ari-Yang> and make the line look like this GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nomodeset" save it, then run in terminal sudo update-grub
[05:12] <Ari-Yang> ^ JeffATL
[05:13] <Cheekio> also, thanks everybody here for being helpful for pretty much no reason other than for being helpful. Channels like #ubuntu are why I'm glad I'm an open source guy.
[05:13] <dylan> So I installed Ubuntu alongside windows, and now I just get "grub>" on boot
[05:14] <linocisco> hi all
[05:14] <linocisco> what is the best Travel and Tour management software?
[05:14] <NeverHere> dylan, does your system have UEFI?
[05:14] <dylan> NeverHere: I'm on a Lenovo THinkpad T-530
[05:14] <dylan> I don't think that has UEFI
[05:15] <NeverHere> dylan, you can try reinstall, you have the right bit i assume, 32 64 etc
[05:15] <dylan> re-install what?
[05:15] <NeverHere> ubuntu u.u
[05:16] <dylan> Is there no way to fix grub?
[05:16] <NeverHere> maybe, but not that i know of
[05:16] <NeverHere> :P
[05:16] <wilee-nilee> dylan, you want just windows? If you remove the linux you remove the key grub stuff.
[05:17] <Ben66> dylan: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[05:17] <wilee-nilee> dylan, Do you have more than one HD?
[05:17] <Silver_Arrow> is it normal to have to sudo make install instead of make install?
[05:18] <NeverHere> Silver_Arrow, yes
[05:18] <Silver_Arrow> also, when I try to launch qjoypad from a terminal with or without sudo, nothing pops up
[05:18] <Ben66> Silver_Arrow: you need sudo if its going to modify any system directories. be careful installing things like that because it could cause dependency problems
[05:19] <NeverHere> Silver_Arrow, you can see what is running with ps aux
[05:19] <JeffATL> i used sudo instead of gksudo - thought the nomodeset change took but now i'm back to a scrambled screen
[05:20] <Silver_Arrow> well, the terminal moves to the begining of the next line and doesn't accept input, so something is running, but no window
[05:20] <wilee-nilee> JeffATL, Did you udate-grub
[05:20] <wilee-nilee> update*
[05:20] <JeffATL> wilee-nilee: nope - thanks; i forgot
[05:21] <JeffATL> i've been accustomed to editing a grub.conf directly and rebooting; my bad
[05:26] <linocisco> what is the best Travel and Tour management software?
[05:26] <zykotick9> !best > linocisco
[05:26] <ubottu> linocisco, please see my private message

[05:27] <dr_willis> JeffATL:  edit /etc/default/grub for perment changes
[05:27] <linocisco> zykotick9, so known to be good softwares in ENglish.
[05:27] <JeffATL> i'm not finding "software sources" in the dashboard - there's "ubuntu software center..."
[05:28] <dr_willis> JeffATL: that has a menu item in it for sources
[05:28] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, then maybe to go system settings and search from there?
[05:28] <Ari-Yang> *shrugs*
[05:29] <rasanen7> Hello, I have a samba mount point where the filenames include umlauts and whatnot. I can't access those files due to those chars. I've tried to mount.cifs it with using iocharset (utf8, iso8859-1) with no luck. Any hints?
[05:29] <dr_willis> from terminal its like gnome-source-? or somthing.  :-P
[05:29] <JeffATL> "additional drivers" is in "system settings"
[05:30] <dr_willis> software-properties-gtk   may be it.
[05:30] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, so you found it, yes? you see the 'Additional Drivers' tab?
[05:30] <dr_willis> its on the last tab of the sources setti g tool in the latest releases
[05:31] <JeffATL> Ari-Yang: it's not a tab; it's an icon - first one under "hardware"
[05:31] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, right.
[05:31] <Ari-Yang> forgot you're on 12.04
[05:31] <Ari-Yang> JeffATL, if you see flgrx and fglrx (updates), choose fglrx (updates)
[05:31] <JeffATL> it has the "searching for available drivers" thing just going and going
[05:32] <zykotick9> rasanen7: <don't reply to me> "Any hints?" = stop using samba
[05:32] <JeffATL> it just ended saying "no proprietary drivers are in use on this system"
[05:32] <dr_willis> or check askubuntu.com or #samba or stackexchange
[05:34] <rasanen7> zykotick9: point taken, though inevitable at the moment :P
[05:35] <JeffATL> now, if i go to ub software center and search for fglrx, i get "XvBA-based backend for VA API (AMD fglrx implementation)"
[05:36] <dr_willis> !ati
[05:36] <ubottu> For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto
[05:38] <Silver_Arrow> Hmm, how do I run a command, but not bind it to the terminal it started from?
[05:39] <looped> hi. im trying to use bind9 to configure a local dns so that i can control resolving one subdomain (x.y.com) using private ips. ive setup a zone file for y.com and only entered records for x.y.com which works well, however that causes other subdomains of y.com to not resolve anymore
[05:39] <looped> if i add just zone "x.y.com" in my named.conf.local then none of the subdomains resolve.
[05:40] <dr_willis> Silver_Arrow:  bash job controll basics. use &. or nohup. or screen ;-)
[05:40] <dr_willis> command  &
[05:41] <dr_willis> or ctrl-z.   then 'bg'  for background
[05:41] <looped> sorry, correction - if i change my named.conf.local to use zone "x.y.com" all other subdomains resolve using the external dns correctly, but the x.y.com subdomain fails to resolve.
[05:43] <VioByte> looped, thats because you don't have the zone populated with what the authoritative dns has.
[05:43] <looped> VioByte: i did create a zone file which has entries for x.y.com
[05:43] <VioByte> looped, but no others.
[05:44] <looped> thats right. so i guess my question is - how do i correctly set this up so that my local configuration is *only* used for the one subdomain
[05:44] <JeffATL> re the above ati link - i'm having trouble mapping lspci results to the choices there
[05:44] <VioByte> looped, See the first DNS that says "HEY i manage that domains records" will respond to any and all requests for that domain. thus cached in your dns lookup tables
[05:45] <JeffATL> lspci says amd/ati RS690M [radeon Xpress 1200/1250/1270]
[05:45] <VioByte> looped, But as for what your attempting todo "Control one subdomain of a domain managed by another dns" wont work.
[05:46] <VioByte> unless there's a trick i've not ran across yet.
[05:46] <histo> JeffATL: to the choices where?
[05:46] <JeffATL> histo: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx
[05:46] <looped> VioByte: ouch.
[05:46] <looped> i'm wondering if i could use forwarding?
[05:47] <JeffATL> histo: and fwiw, this is a gateway netbook
[05:47] <histo> JeffATL: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&product=2.4.1.3.12&lang=English
[05:47] <histo> JeffATL: http://askubuntu.com/questions/155352/problem-graphics-with-ati-radeon-x1270-rs690m-on-ubuntu-12-04
[05:48] <VioByte> looped.. you could try to make a copy of the authority dns' records. but if they update there records.. your records would be out of date.
[05:48] <looped> VioByte: well these are my own domains
[05:48] <VioByte> but af for forwarding... not that i'm aware of.. If your dns managed that domain then it will not forward any failed lookups for that domain to another dns
[05:49] <histo> VioByte: why not use the other dns for secondary
[05:49] <Ben66> looped: you should just change the dns for real
[05:49] <looped> but i was hoping not to have too much duplications (the actual records are in route53). i basically *only* want two of my servers to contact an endpoint using a LAN

[05:49] <looped> Ben66: i dont want to change it for all servers, just specific ones
[05:50] <JeffATL> histo: i have done the nomodeset thing so i don't have a scrambled screen, but i'm stuck with 1024x768 resolution only (wrong aspect ratio for screen besides)
[05:50] <Ben66> looped: that makes no sense
[05:50] <VioByte> histo: the first DNS that says "Hey i host the records" will respond and if the zone record does not exists, it will return not found.
[05:50] <histo> JeffATL: yes you need fglrx
[05:50] <VioByte> histo: it will not fail over to the ISP
[05:50] <looped> Ben66: sorry, i should have said, i dont want all clients of the x.y.com host to see the change.
[05:50] <VioByte> histo: since it already got a response from the first dns
[05:50] <histo> !info fglrx-legacy
[05:50] <ubottu> Package fglrx-legacy does not exist in raring

[05:53] <dr_willis> most netbooks ive seen use intel video. not ati
[05:54] <histo> JeffATL: you need the legacy driver from the other links section on the ubottu page. http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx  this one
[05:54] <JeffATL> dr_willis: please.  label on top and lspci say ati
[05:54] <histo> dr_willis: hopefully it's not a intel/amd combo card he'll really be crying later
[05:54] <dr_willis> if you say so. ive got 4+ netbooks. never seen an ati one
[05:55] <dr_willis> histo:  that would be weird in a netbook. ;-)

[06:04] <linocisco> Senjai, can't find
[06:04] <Senjai> linocisco: what makes you think we'd know then?
[06:04] <Senjai> linocisco: this is a channel about ubuntu, not travel.

[06:04] <linocisco> Senjai, u r the big community
[06:04] <JeffATL> VioByte: thanks
[06:04] <linocisco> i want linux based
[06:05] <Senjai> linocisco: we R the wrong community for you ;)
[06:05] <Senjai> linocisco: Well keep searching, or code your own (tm)
[06:05] <linocisco> i mean software
[06:05] <JeffATL> VioByte: same; no zlib found
[06:05] <linocisco> not about travel and tour
[06:05] <Senjai> linocisco: you just said travel and tour
[06:05] <VioByte> JeffATL: odd.
[06:05] <VioByte> JeffATL: try apt-cache search zlib
[06:06] <Senjai> linocisco: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/ knock yourself out
[06:06] <JeffATL> VioByte: perhaps zlib-bin?
[06:06] <linocisco> I just want names of software somebody is using with no errors
[06:07] <VioByte> JeffATL: possible.
[06:07] <JeffATL> linocisco: i think part of the problem is that i don't think any of us even knows what "travel and tour software" even means.
[06:07] <VioByte> JeffATL if its not it then you can uninstall what you just installed with apt-get remove <packagename>
[06:08] <VioByte> JeffATL: so you don't have unneeded stuff installed and taking up space.
[06:09] <VioByte> JeffATL: and if you know what file its looking for you can "apt-get install apt-file" then "apt-file update" then "apt-file search <filename>"
[06:09] <VioByte> JeffATL: that'll show you what package has that file
[06:10] <JeffATL> VioByte: i think these instructions are just being obtuse; it says "libraries for xxxx" so it's a matter of apt-cache search like you suggested just to make an edu guess as to the package name
[06:10] <histo> !find zlib-bin
[06:10] <ubottu> Found: libghc-zlib-bindings-dev, libghc-zlib-bindings-doc, libghc-zlib-bindings-prof, zlib-bin
[06:11] <VioByte> JeffATL: Well it should install its depends automatically.
[06:11] <dr_willis> for compiling you normally need the -dev packages
[06:12] <VioByte> JeffATL: if you are getting the package from apt-get.. unless, what you are trying to install was downloading and not available on apt-get
[06:13] <VioByte> JeffATL: then its almost a guessing game on what it wants.
[06:13] <dr_willis> so.. what are you installing/doing exactly?
[06:13] <JeffATL> dr_willis: you mean me?
[06:14] <VioByte> dr_willis, depends if its a bin install or compiled.
[06:14] <dr_willis> you are the one trying to install somthing JeffATL ?
[06:14] <VioByte> dr_willis, If its a required dev package for a compilation.. then thats easy to find and fix.
[06:15] <VioByte> as for bins... they usually have libraries included
[06:15] <JeffATL> dr_willis: my top-level goal is to be able to run this ATI at the display's best resolution (will only do 1024x768 now; wrong aspect ratio) and also be able to use an external monitor (not mirror mode)
[06:16] <JeffATL> this has sent me down a rabbit hole where i'm trying to figure out if i have CFree86-Mesa-libGL and seven other things
[06:17] <VioByte> JeffATL, Hope you get it resolved.

[06:39] <dr_willis_> the apt get should pull in all it needs. unless you got a custome kernel

[06:40] <ubottu> To install the Linux (kernel) headers, open a terminal and: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) To install headers for libraries, you need the accompanying -dev packages
[06:40] <JeffATL> dr_willis_: no; just as the install laid it in
[06:40] <dr_willis_> you mean rhe. run driver? or the apt-get install?
[06:42] <dr_willis_> id concure. the  apt-get  update and upgrade. and perhaps a  apt-get dist-upgrade  to be sure all is at the latest version.

[08:13] <JeffATL> log file cited by the error message says "kernel includes at /lib/modules/3.8.0-29-generic/build/include not found or incomplete"
[08:13] <JeffATL> racho: ^
[08:13] <MooreJohn90> Hi, Can I possible to make a phone call via EVDO USB modem?
=== james_ is now known as Guest17790
[08:14] <racho> so while running a live cd?
[08:14] <dr_willis_> GoldenVirginia:  if you formated sdb  you need to delete and repartion it
[08:14] <dr_willis_> GoldenVirginia:  you may want to use gparted
[08:15] <GoldenVirginia> gparted on a server ?
[08:16] <JeffATL> racho: 12.04 is installed;
[08:17] <JeffATL> i'm having trouble getting a grub screen when i boot the CD - am i doing something wrong?
[08:18] <cfhowlett> JeffATL: check the ISO with md5sum.  check the CD with "check disk integrity"
[08:18] <cfhowlett> JeffATL: wait, scratch that.
[08:19] <JeffATL> cfhowlett: no, no - it'll boot; i just need to tell it nomodeset
[08:19] <cfhowlett> JeffATL: booting the cd bypasses grub so ... no grub!
[08:19] <cfhowlett> !nomodeset
[08:19] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[08:19] <JeffATL> oh, ok
[08:22] <dr_willis_> the live cds have a way to do nomodeset.
[08:23] <JeffATL> dr_willis_: above link had it described - it's trying to boot now
[08:24] <dr_willis_> i used to need nomodeset. but not any more since 11. <unconvertable> release
[08:24] <dr_willis_> bbl
[08:25] <sepero> JeffATL: Hey, help vote this up http://meta.unix.stackexchange.com/a/1378/23373
[08:26] <JeffATL> sepero: wtf?
[08:26] <racho> god i hate apt...
[08:27] <wilee-nilee> JeffATL, please don't use that acronym here
[08:27] <JeffATL> wilee-nilee: my bad; sorry
[08:29] <racho> JeffATL, so did it boot with nomodeset?
[08:29] <JeffATL> racho: yes, but with bad resolution
[08:29] <racho> that's not the live cd right?
[08:29] <racho> you're booting your installation
[08:30] <JeffATL> racho: right now with the 13.04 livecd; 12.04 is on the disk and i've got nomodeset persistently there
[08:31] <bariho> is there a photo viewer available in the repositories, that is able to do a full screen slide show of a folder of photos in a random order?

[08:33] <JeffATL> racho - per http://askubuntu.com/questions/124292/what-is-the-correct-way-to-install-ati-catalyst-video-drivers-fglrx/286775#286775 , this is one of the cards that can no longer use the AMD catalyst drivers and has to use open source drivers
[08:34] <JeffATL> but really, i need to give up and go to bed; this has become a nightmare
[08:34] <racho> JeffATL, 13.04 does not support the default fglrx that come from the repos. there is the xorg-edgers ppa for this thing but i really advise not to go down this road
=== acidflash_ is now known as acidflash
[08:34] <JeffATL> racho: ok
[08:34] <racho> the best course is to the use the open source one
[08:35] <JeffATL> racho: but that sends me into either scrambled-screen land or, with nomodeset 1024x768 only
[08:35] <racho> performance is a little lower than catalyst (and power management is terrible at least in 3.8) but it will work and be stable
[08:36] <racho> JeffATL, you're trying to upgrade to 13.04 or just checking out?
[08:36] <JeffATL> racho: i'm jsut trying to get this laptop functional enough to do a libreoffice impress presentation
[08:37] <racho> JeffATL, well if you have 12.04 installed do the presentation in a 13.04 live cd session?
[08:37] <racho> why?
[08:37] <MordFustang> can someone tell me how to run python script forever?
[08:37] <JeffATL> racho: i need two screens working, in correct resolutions
[08:38] <ikonia> MordFustang: what do you mean "forever"
[08:38] <racho> JeffATL, alright but still why boot the 13.04 live cd when you have 12.04? at least in 12.04 the catalyst from the official repos work
[08:39] <JeffATL> racho: no, it didn't work
[08:39] <MordFustang> ikonia if I run python script by hand python script.py it runs forever, but if I create bash script, it ends in 1 min i guess
[08:39] <kalle_> I have a problem with the package "ftp-proxy". I have set up a reverse proxy for my FTP on a firewall/NAT machine, but I get random "Connection reset by peer" when doing file listings in empty directories...
[08:39] <ikonia> MordFustang: that makes just no sense, they are two different things doing two different tasks, they will end when the task completes
[08:40] <ikonia> MordFustang: could you provide some context incase I am missing something
[08:40] <racho> JeffATL, then boot the 12.04..go to another console (Ctral+Alt+F1-7) and remove the fgrlx packages
[08:40] <racho> JeffATL, reboot.. make sure you get your native resolution
[08:40] <MordFustang> ikonia i'm using dropbox downloader in python
[08:41] <ikonia> MordFustang: go on.....
[08:41] <JeffATL> racho: neither fgrlx or fglrx-legacy would install - error about includes
[08:41] <MordFustang> ikonia there is a script watching.py which is scanning all the time so it never ends
[08:42] <ikonia> MordFustang: ok,
[08:42] <ikonia> MordFustang: keep going.....
[08:42] <racho> JeffATL, do you have linux-headers installed?
[08:43] <JeffATL> racho: at the moment, i don't know
[08:43] <MordFustang> ikonia now I create bash script to run this in crontab but its not running all the time
[08:44] <JeffATL> racho: ok, fglrx removed
=== cantoma is now known as Guest24591
=== jduro_ is now known as cantoma
[08:46] <JeffATL> racho: linux-headers for this version is alrady installed
[08:46] <ikonia> MordFustang: it doesn't quite work like that, crontab has no shell enviornment by default, you have to set one up in the script
[08:46] <ikonia> MordFustang: I suspect it's execting because it's running - failing, exiting,
[08:46] <racho> JeffATL, i can even suggest apt-get purge fglrx. reboot and let us see if you get your default screen res
[08:46] <ikonia> MordFustang: so it appears to run for a minute then end
[08:47] <JeffATL> racho: did that purche; rebooting
[08:48] <holden87> Hi guys, i have one question. I've been checking out the Moka icons that were published on omgubuntu, and i switched to them in myunity. Now i have a question, how can i switch back to default. Could anyone of you please check in myunity which is your default icon set, just so i don't mistake it. Thanks
[08:49] <racho> holden87, i think ubuntu-mono-dark
[08:49] <JeffATL> racho: rebooted to 1024x768 and that's the only one i can select
[08:50] <MordFustang> ikonia: any alternative to run this script on boot without crontab?
[08:50] <racho> JeffATL, lspci | grep VGA
[08:50] <subu> hi
[08:50] <Monday> what do i type to try out the xfce desktop thanks
[08:50] <ikonia> MordFustang: the obvious options would be 1.) script it properly so it can be executed from cron 2.) run it as a daemon in a startup script
[08:51] <JeffATL> racho: up-arrowing
[08:51] <holden87> racho, thank you!
[08:51] <JeffATL> lspci says amd/ati RS690M [radeon Xpress 1200/1250/1270]
[08:51] <subu> I am trying to install ubuntu from usb . I am getting stuck at Net:Registered protocol family 1
[08:51] <JeffATL> racho: ^
[08:52] <racho> JeffATL, oh god. X1200...
[08:52] <JeffATL> racho: exxactly.
[08:52] <subu> can anyone help me
[08:53] <Monday> subu if you are having problems with the ubuntu installer, you can probably try Linux Mint
[08:53] <ikonia> Monday: why ???
[08:53] <JeffATL> racho: it seems like a problem that may be common to any distro, evne gentoo
[08:53] <ikonia> Monday: why would an install problem dictate "try mint"
[08:53] <MordFustang> ikonia; https://wiki.umms.med.umich.edu/display/ET/9.+providing+RPi+sync+with+Dropbox+Server can you check crontab part
[08:53] <backwards> hi
[08:54] <ikonia> the plan is to understand the problem and help the user, not point them at a random distribution
[08:54] <backwards> hi
[08:54] <JeffATL> ikonia: <raises hand>
[08:54] <subu> Will linux mint load ubuntu?
[08:54] <ikonia> subu: no, it's a totally different linux distribution
[08:54] <backwards> hah that confused me
[08:54] <ikonia> subu: hence why Monday's advice makes no sense
[08:54] <subu> but i want ubuntu
[08:54] <backwards> ok then install ubuntu
[08:54] <ikonia> subu: great, so state the problem, and work with people in the channel to see if they can help resolve your issues
[08:54] <Monday> subu, Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu with a Windows-like desktop
[08:55] <ikonia> Monday: no it's nothing like windows
[08:55] <subu> I am trying to install ubuntu from usb . I am getting stuck at Net:Registered protocol family 1
[08:55] <ikonia> Monday: and it's moving away from ubuntu - the desktop is a totally different experience
[08:55] <JeffATL> ok, gotta sleep
[08:55] <ikonia> Monday: if you a.) don't really know what you are suggesting b.) can't help fix the problem the user has, please don't offer random stuff
[08:55] <backwards> actually i too had trouble installing mint on one of my PC's using a cd
[08:55] <backwards> never got it to work
[08:55] <subu> I tried with 12.04 and then with 13
[08:55] <racho> JeffATL, problem is X1200 is bascially dead...
[08:55] <ikonia> subu: just state the problem, and people will try to help if they can
[08:55] <racho> fglrx does not support it
[08:56] <subu> I am trying to install ubuntu from usb . I am getting stuck at Net:Registered protocol family 1 - this is the problem
[08:56] <racho> open radeon does but not fully i guess saying you can get only 1024x768
[08:56] <ikonia> MordFustang: what am I looking at here ?
[08:56] <Monday> ikonia, no one was helping on here for over 10 minutes of asking so i'm trying to help him because i know that the Linux Mint installer worked fine
[08:56] <JeffATL> racho: it's like it's either windows or nothing for this thing
[08:57] <subu> monday: sorry i can't use mint
[08:57] <MordFustang> ikonia: crontab part, you can see how script is made
[08:57] <ikonia> Monday: it installs mint though, and you don't know the linux minst installer works for him
[08:57] <subu> <ikonia> : any suggestion?
[08:57] <ikonia> MordFustang: that guide is for raspbian ?
[08:57] <ikonia> subu: I've not been following your problem, sorry
[08:57] <MordFustang> ikonia: yes
[08:57] <subu> I am trying to install ubuntu from usb . I am getting stuck at Net:Registered protocol family 1
[08:57] <ikonia> MordFustang: are you using raspbien ?
[08:57] <MordFustang> ikonia: yes
[08:58] <subu> <ikonia> : I am trying to install ubuntu from usb . I am getting stuck at Net:Registered protocol family 1
[08:58] <ikonia> MordFustang: then why are you asking in #ubuntu
[08:58] <MordFustang> ikonia: this should also work in ubuntu :D
[08:58] <ikonia> MordFustang: no it shouldn't as it uses a different cron setup
[08:59] <subu> Can anyone help please
[08:59] <ikonia> MordFustang: this channel is for ubuntu support only, you've not even asked in #raspberrypi - so I suggest taking it to the correct channel please, and please don't use this channel for raspberry suppport
[08:59] <ikonia> subu: one moment
[08:59] <MordFustang> ikonia: ok
[08:59] <ikonia> MordFustang: thanks
[09:00] <ikonia> subu: is this a standard home PC ?
[09:00] <subu> yes
[09:00] <Monday> aren't there any Ubuntu support ops on here?
[09:00] <ksinkar> Ben66: I used xev, and it seems that Alt_L and Alt_R are being recognized correctly
[09:00] <ikonia> subu: are you using a usb hub, or a usb device (such as a keyboard) with a usb hub in ?
[09:00] <ikonia> Monday: yes, they are in #ubuntu-ops
[09:01] <subu> i am using my usb pen drive
[09:01] <histo> Monday: why?
[09:01] <ksinkar> Ben66: but the problem is that I cannot use Alt R as Alt Gr as described on the internet. I am not able to do AltGr + 5 and get a Euro sign on my editor
[09:01] <ikonia> Monday: if you need someone you can join that channel and ask for some help
[09:01] <ikonia> subu: apart from the pen drive,
[09:01] <Monday> histo, if there are so many ops why isn't anyone else people
[09:01] <ikonia> Monday: there are 1600 people in this channel
[09:01] <ikonia> Monday: very few are ops
[09:01] <ikonia> Monday: if you need help from the operators join #ubuntu-ops and ask
[09:02] <Monday> but only a couple of people are asking for help and no one is helping
[09:02] <subu> Apart from then pen drive i have a PATA hard disk , normal keyboard and USB mouse
[09:02] <ikonia> Monday: ops are not "super helpers"
[09:02] <ikonia> Monday: the channel relies on anyone helping
[09:02] <histo> !volunteers | Monday
[09:02] <ubottu> Monday: The people here are volunteers, your attitude should reflect that. Answers are not always available. See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines
[09:02] <neta> i have a problem with installing ubuntu- i have windows 7 and i'm trying to unstall ubuntu 12.04 in dual boot. i made a dok (don't have a cd rom). when i restart the computer i can enter the setup of the bios. when i enable UEFI Boot Support and then restart the computer see the usb and give me the screen where i can choose to install ubuntu (or run it without installing). so far so good- then when i choose to install i get a black screen, and
[09:02] <ikonia> subu: so you have no usb hubs on your machine
[09:02] <subu> no
[09:02] <Monday> isn't there a schedule for ops to ensure that at least 3 ops are supporting the channel at any given time
[09:02] <ikonia> subu: do you have a DVD drive ?
[09:03] <subu> I have 4 USB ports on my machine
[09:03] <ikonia> Monday: ops are not support experts,
[09:03] <subu> No
[09:03] <histo> !nomodeset | neta
[09:03] <ubottu> neta: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[09:03] <ikonia> Monday: ops are there to help the channel run smoothly
[09:03] <ikonia> subu: that is frustrating as it looks like the common cause of your problem is down to the usb device
[09:03] <ikonia> subu: I'm just doing a little more research
[09:03] <Monday> well only ubuntu support experts should be ops
[09:03] <ikonia> Monday: that's not how it works,
[09:04] <ikonia> Monday: you're welcome to join #ubuntu-ops and this can be explained to you
[09:04] <histo> Monday: or you're welcome to hang out and help others.
[09:04] <subu> ikonia: Will booting from DVD solve the issue?
[09:04] <ikonia> subu: I was interested if it did as a test, due to the common issue on your problem being a usb device
[09:05] <subu> Then I have to hijack a dvd drive from my office today
[09:05] <ikonia> subu: so what is plugged into your usb ports ?
[09:05] <histo> subu: what make and model machine are you trying to install on?
[09:05] <neta> ubottu, histo: tnx! i'll try this :)
[09:05] <ubottu> neta: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[09:05] <subu> My pen drive and my mose is plugged in USB port
[09:06] <ikonia> subu: just for interest, unplug the mouse, see what it does
[09:06] <ikonia> subu: is your keyboard PS2 ?
[09:06] <subu> I had unplugged and tried, same issue
[09:07] <subu> my keyboard is ps2
[09:07] <ikonia> that was a bit of a long shot to be honest
[09:07] <ikonia> if possible unplug all USB devices, and try to boot from DVD, I know it's a bit of effort though
[09:08] <subu> then hijacking a USB drive is the only option left
[09:08] <racho> subu, reboot into BIOS and check disable "Legacy USB Support" if you have it there
[09:08] <zangaroo> does canonical have an irc server ?
[09:08] <subu> Ok racho
[09:09] <subu> I will try this and come back now
[09:12] <subu> racho: the same problem remains
[09:13] <subu> ikonia: is there any more suggestion from your side
[09:16] <subu> I am trying to install ubuntu from usb . I am getting stuck at Net:Registered protocol family 1 - help required
[09:17] <ikonia> subu: there is a suggestion that on some older PC's (Asus mostly) that apci is the issue, however I don't think this will be your issue
[09:17] <racho> subu, what version of ubuntu are you installing?
[09:17] <subu> 13
[09:17] <subu> yea ikonia , my is an old pc
[09:17] <subu> how to go past the acpi problem?
[09:18] <Vyrlokar> Hello everybody. I'm trying to setup a Vostro 3750 laptop that runs an Intel/nVidia Optimus setup under Xubuntu. If I add nomodeset to the kernel boot parameters, the system boots, but I'm restricted to 1024x768 resolution (actual screen resolution is 1600x900) and external monitors are disabled. If I remove it, I get initial output on both the build in and the external monitor, but it freezes during boot. I've tried using drm_kms_
[09:18] <Vyrlokar> By the way, if booting into nomodeset, I can optirun glxspheres and get 5x the FPS compared to normal glxspheres, and the nVidia driver (-304) loads correctly (I do lsmod on a second terminal console to check it)
[09:18] <racho> subu, one shot is to try and update your BIOS firmware if your BIOS manufacturer even has some updates...
[09:18] <subu> ikonia: How to get past the APCI problem?
[09:18] <ikonia> subu: I don't think it is an apci problem for you
[09:18] <Vyrlokar> Any hints on how to get this to work? I've been hammering at it for 2 days, and I'm at my wit's end
[09:19] <subu> racho , this PC is a old desktop -  Celeron 2.4 GHZ with DDR1 RAM
[09:20] <racho> subu, is the mainboard Intel DG45ID
[09:21] <subu> no the main board is ASROCK 4i45GV
[09:22] <subu> racho : I am trying to use this old M/B + Processor + Arduino to do a robot
[09:23] <racho> subu, can't you install from cd
[09:24] <subu> racho , thai is the last option , and then I have to hijack the CD driver from my office
[09:24] <racho> i mean the hardware does not follow the usb standard specs so there is nothing the software(kernel) can do about this
[09:24] <subu> thanks racho
[09:24] <racho> subu, also usually old hardware was not very linux friendly
[09:24] <subu> thanks ikonia
[09:25] <kilo_byte> hello.. I have got multiple Desktop ernvironments in my pc.. and its pretty much pulling down my performance..
[09:25] <racho> in the old days you would tinker with your systems for days to make it work as intended
[09:25] <kilo_byte> how can I uninstall the others i dont want
[09:25] <subu> racho : i will have to steal a CD crive today
[09:25] <subu> + burn a dvd
[09:26] <racho> subu, i think that would be the best option
[09:26] <subu> ok

[09:35] <ezra-s> I am not going to tell you what you may do if I can't see precisely what is hapenning to you
[09:35] <ezra-s> it may be a kernel process or similar
[09:35] <racho> Vyrlokar, can you disable your integrated vga from your BIOS
[09:35] <Vyrlokar> Anyway, I believe that the issue is related to the intel card, because I'm not loading the nVidia card
[09:35] <Vyrlokar> or should not be loading it anyway
[09:37] <racho> Vyrlokar, exactly. some BIOSes support disabling one of the cards and forcing only one of them to be used
[09:37] <neta> problem with installing ubuntu with windows 7- sorry, i don't understand how to make this NOMODESET work. when i restart with dok i don't have this purple screen where i can change the code.. i just have a black screen with text that askes if i what to install ubuntu or try witput installing, and no matter what i choose i get a black screen...
[09:37] <histo> neta: press the shift key just after you bios posts to get to the grub screen
[09:38] <histo> neta: what version of ubuntu are you trying to install btw?
[09:38] <neta> histo: 12.04
[09:38] <histo> kilo_byte: multiple DEs will nto hamper performance
[09:38] <histo> neta: 64bit?
[09:38] <kilo_byte> !reboot
[09:39] <backwards> why is this record so hard to get. damnit
[09:39] <neta> histo: 64, yes
[09:39] <kilo_byte> histo, but my os has gone pretty slow these days
[09:39] <Vyrlokar> racho: unfortunately, I can't do that
[09:39] <histo> neta: odd, anyhoot repeatedly pressing the shift key will get you to the grub menu. Then you can follow the directions
[09:39] <dr_willis> neta:  the cd boot stuff has an option menu befor you get to the  try/install screen

[09:40] <dr_willis> !nomodeset
[09:40] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
=== _BJFreeman is now known as BJfreeman
[09:40] <kilo_byte> histo, how to?
[09:40] <histo> neta: are you not even seeing the first screen that says "try ubuntu" "install" etc...?
[09:40] <Pricey> oh, increased
[09:41] <histo> kilo_byte: top in a terminal or bring up the system monitor in the GUI
[09:42] <neta> dr_willis, histo: i don't have options before i get the screen that askes me if i want to install or try without. but i can press F2 foor boot options
[09:43] <histo> neta: then you can set nomodeset there
[09:43] <dr_willis> theres a man=keybord  icon you see real fast. you hit space when you see that.
[09:43] <histo> neta: did you not look at the link?
[09:43] <dr_willis> then you use f5 or f6
[09:43] <dr_willis> i recall the url has screenshots
[09:44] <histo> neta: I believe F6 on the try ubuntu screen is for boot options
[09:44] <histo> dr_willis: it does
[09:45] <Web-aptosid415> synaptic
[09:46] <dr_willis> in the past ive edited the boot file menus on the live usb to make nomodeset the default.
[09:46] <neta> histo, dr_willis: i read the link but didn't understand much... i'll try to restart my computer now and get to boot options from the ubuntu install screen.. so far i tried only from the bios before

[09:49] <Web-aptosid415> apt-get install gdebi
[09:49] <histo> neta: That screen is the "Try Ubuntu" screen you mentioned earlier no?
[09:49] <neta> histo: yes
[09:49] <histo> neta: Then what do you mean you don't get those screens?
[09:50] <Web-aptosid415> apt-get install synaptic

[09:52] <neta> histo: dok, not cd (my laptop is too small for a cd rom)
[09:52] <histo> neta: what is dok?
[09:52] <neta> histo: disk on key
[09:53] <havires> the one included with the iso, im on my phone atm so its kind of hard to type  histo
[09:53] <havires> im trying to do a dual boot
[09:53] <histo> neta: how did you create it?
[09:54] <histo> havires: There is no efi fix included with the iso so I have no idea what the hell youa re talking about. If you are trying to install on a UEFI system you need to be using 64bit
[09:54] <neta> histo: i downloaded the iso and then used universal-usb-installer
[09:55] <histo> neta: check the md5sum of your iso

[10:31] <burg> jrib, http://codepad.org/7zNe5BFr

[10:34] <histo> nathanbz: why are you trying to put a pid file there?
[10:34] <jrib> burg: so does the ACL get set correctly on children of that directory?  How about parents?
[10:35] <nathanbz> where else do you put them ?
[10:36] <burg> jrib, i only get that error message. that is the location of a web server's projects managed by ispconfig, actually what i am trying to do is give full access to one user i will be using with samba
[10:36] <ItsMeLenny> what are other usb commands that can be run in terminal to get information on the device?
[10:36] <jrib> burg: if you drop the recursive flag and pass a child of that directory, does it work ok?  What about a parent?
[10:37] <burg> jrib, sudo setfacl -m u:ultra:rwx /projects works
[10:38] <burg> jrib, sudo setfacl -m u:ultra:rwx /projects/clients/client0/web1/web also works

[10:44] <burg> njuergens, jrib, http://codepad.org/gPEjqXXW - doesn't seem to be immutable. but not sure

[10:46] <burg> jrib, i suppose i can remove the immutable flag, but the new projects will also have it, right?

[10:49] <burg> njuergens, english
[10:50] <mikubuntu> No-one: it worked until it didn't ... lol. i don't know, it belongs to my friends son. it supposedly had ubuntu on it and just stopped working (of course i don't know what he might have messed with). but now i can't get it to boot at all.
[10:51] <njuergens> burg, system->server config-><your server>->web->permissions
[10:51] <njuergens> there you find 'Make web folders immutable (extended attributes)'
[10:52] <burg> njuergens, thanks. let me check with a new website. until then, chattr -i /path/to/folder to remove the i flag?

[11:19] <ikonia> mikubuntu: looks like a package version conflict
[11:20] <Dr_Willis> mikubuntu:  if you definatly have the cd first.. then that would suggest that the cd was burnt badly and being ignored.
[11:20] <ikonia> mikubuntu: sorry, that was meant for aneesh_
[11:20] <ikonia> not you
[11:20] <Dr_Willis> ikonia:  ;) i was wondering if i was confused ;P
[11:20] <ikonia> aneesh_: do you have any PPA's on your system, it certainly looks like something has created a conflict

[11:23] <Dr_Willis> mikubuntu:  try a simple distro like tiny-core linux make a bootable usb of that. see if it boots on other machines then test on yours.. Its likely your machine is being a pain and not wnating to boot from anything else.

[11:24] <Yu-Yu> sepero: They broke my awesome xsession that it didn't work until I found what's the problem. Also, they surprisingly changed layout switching to Super+Space. Why, ever?...
[11:25] <ikonia> aneesh_: I'd suggest using none unless you have confidence that the person who maintains it has a clue about what he's doing
[11:25] <Yu-Yu> sepero: And until I got in a full GNOME Shell, I couldn't ever get they did the change.

[11:34] <sepero> Yu-Yu: You will be happy
[11:34] <Monday> jrib, how would i remove it
[11:35] <sepero> Monday: the package to install is xubuntu-desktop
[11:35] <Dr_Willis> its harder to remove then install. ;)
[11:35] <Yu-Yu> sepero: Why not everyone use 12.04 so, tell me?
[11:35] <Dr_Willis> thats the curse of 'meta-packages'
[11:36] <jrib> Monday: apt-get remove the package
[11:36] <sepero> Yu-Yu: Because they are confused  ;)
[11:36] <Dr_Willis> removeing xubuntu-desktop wont automatically remove all teh stuff the meta package installed.. unless theres been some changes ive missed.
[11:36] <jrib> Monday: you can use autoremove afterwards to remove any packages you don't need
[11:37] <Dr_Willis> Monday:  cleanest way to 'test' would be just to try xubuntu  live cd in virtualbox.
[11:37] <Monday> sudo  apt-get autoremove xubuntu-desktop ?
[11:37] <Yu-Yu> sepero: Are you using 12.04?
[11:37] <sepero> Yu-Yu: yes, I am
[11:37] <jrib> Monday: no.  apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop && apt-get autoremove
[11:38] <jrib> Monday: maybe apt-get remove --auto-remove xubuntu-desktop, but I've never used this form
[11:39] <Dr_Willis> err.. I just did a 'apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop' then 'apt-get autoremove' and it dident remove anything with autoremove
[11:39] <jrib> Dr_Willis: depends on how kubuntu-desktop was installed
[11:39] <Dr_Willis> with apt-get install kubuntu-desktop   as far as i rember. ;)
[11:40] <sepero> $ cat /etc/lsb-release

[11:45] <newhoa> I'm using an AMD FX-6100 and don't think Turbo Core/Boost/Whatever is working. I tried to check cpufreq-aperf but it all comes back "offline". Turns out checking /var/log/boot.log shows "Loading cpufreq kernel modules... [fail]". I can't find any info on how to get them to load.
[11:46] <eur33r> ronbeing: mornin'
[11:46] <eur33r> bazhang: I was only saying hi

[11:58] <Yu-Yu> marianne: Does it get detected correctly, ever?
[11:58] <cablop> hello, people
[11:59] <BluesKaj> marianne, your SB card has a history of problems , unfortunately the maker hasn't provided a decent driver for it .
[11:59] <marianne> Yu-Yu: yes, you can choose it in Alsamixer
[11:59] <cablop> mmm, my question is, what are the recommended permissions for a directory to be served with apache, i need to have access to the files i'm serving and at the same time i need for apache to access the files, but i need to restrict the files to other users
