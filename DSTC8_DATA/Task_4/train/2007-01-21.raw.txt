[06:29] <Gorlist> Evening people - quick question though not directly Ubuntu related
[06:29] <FunnyLookinHat> ShadowX, the biggest thing to understand is that you install EVERYTHING either via Add/Remove under the Applications menu or via Synaptic (System - Admin. - Synaptic)
[06:29] <ardchoille42> daddydoc, chown changes ownership, chmod changes permissions
[06:29] <Gorlist> is their any Linux version of Visual Basic?
[06:29] <gaspipe1> !paste
[06:29] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:29] <AlexC_> Gorlist: lol, no.
[06:29] <adaptr> ardchoille42: well, I am 100% sure it was still -L in Dapper.. it seems they changed that :(
[06:29] <Judicata> Gorlist: *gasp*

[06:29] <Kensey> back around edgy release were many long threads of woe from people who didn't use update-manafer and/or had systems screwed up by third-party package utils
[06:29] <Balsamic_Chicken> hey guys, anyone know a solution to the problem here? http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg139467.html
[06:29] <Herpes> everything worked almost perfect, but when i updated the system and kernel it stopped working
[06:29] <adaptr> gaspipe1: note that, it's -l (small L) , not -L
[06:29] <AlexC_> Gorlist: VB is made by Microsoft, do you think they'd make a Linux version?
[06:29] <FunnyLookinHat> ShadowX, Avoid compiling your own programs because they are more than likely already in the repositories
[06:29] <ardchoille42> adaptr, Yeah, they must have changed it, I'm on Dapper
[06:29] <Gorlist> well i mean more because of the simply drag drop editor thing :)

[06:30] <AlexC_> Gorlist: you can use Glade to create interfaces, like in VB

[06:30] <heydabop> Kensey: What do you mean saying that way lies with maddness?
[06:30] <daddydoc> i will try now
[06:30] <kiamo> adaptr, downloaded the vlc ubuntu file from videolans site and did what it said
[06:30] <heydabop> Oh, whoops.
[06:30] <adaptr> gaspipe1: I know.. please read everything I type for you - nobody's perfect
[06:30] <heydabop> Never mind.
[06:30] <Gorlist> right will do a search for it - thanks!
[06:30] <Judicata> o0splitpaw0o: ok, repaste your xorg.conf for me, please. and if you just search for "fglrx" in Synaptic, those two pacakges should pop up so you can see ith they're installed.
[06:30] <ShadowX> FunnyLookinHat, I understand that. what I need is something that teaches you about Linux in general, but also about Ubuntu. I know very little Linux, but everything I find to teach you uses Red Hat or Fedora......it gets annoying lol
[06:30] <Herpes> when it boots the system is missing some directories and i get it busybox
[06:30] <speedracer> i used gparted to make a partition ... how do i mount that partition and keep it mounted?
[06:30] <oFF-beAt> seeing microsoft/... i wish i invented wheels n copyrighted it.. i'd b the richest man in the world
[06:30] <adaptr> kiamo: that's... stupid, install the Ubuntu package
