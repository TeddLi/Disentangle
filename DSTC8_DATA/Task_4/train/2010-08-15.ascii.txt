[18:58] <dhani> thanks for those who helped me...
[18:58] <headkase314> cesc, how did the driver go?
[18:58] <sebsebseb> Rogue1: Why do you want 10.04?
[18:58] <Ridpojken> headkase314: But i can't get in to the sound prefs. I get stuck at the "waiting for sound system" thing...
[18:59] <sebsebseb> Rogue1: 9.04 is still good untill end of October when support runs out, and 8.04 has untill the end of April next year, and thats still a good version
[18:59] <Rogue1> sebsebseb: just prefer to be up-to-date. find some packages don't seem to be available in add/remove programs, etc. etc.
[18:59] <headkase314> Ridpojken, go to: Applications > Accessories > Terminal and in the terminal type "gstreamer-properties" without the quotes and press enter.  In the device section for the sound output can you select your wanted device there?
[19:00] <Rogue1> sebsebseb: system ran fine using VortexBox (vortexbox.org, based on Fedora Core 11) - but I've been plagued with problems since trying to get Ubuntu on it :(
[19:00] <pheonixman> when i try to delete a folder, it gives me the error "Device or Resource busy" ...any help
[19:00] <sebsebseb> Rogue1: vortexbox ?
[19:00] <sebsebseb> Rogue1: you had Fedora 11 on there?
[19:01] <Ridpojken> headkase314: under the alsa plug in, yes
[19:01] <Rogue1> sebsebseb: no, I had VortexBox on there (jukebox/media streaming server) - which is built on FC11
[19:01] <sebsebseb> Rogue1: oh
[19:01] <_Pb> has anyone here installed ubuntu, then another distro, and wasn't able to boot back into ubuntu?
[19:01] <HoopyFrood> is it a problem in grub?
[19:02] <headkase314> Ridpojken, does your onboard sound now function correct if you choose it?  And can you now go into the regular sound properties without it hanging?
[19:02] <_Pb> i think so
[19:02] <sarge1221> Muelli: what happens if you get this message when you try to md5sum a disk?  sarge1221@Darkmotion:~$ md5sum /dev/cdrom                        md5sum: /dev/cdrom: Input/output error
[19:02] <_Pb> HoopyFrood: also, i can't seem to mount or fsck my ubuntu partition
[19:02] <Muelli> sarge1221: hm. I'd say an Input/Output error happened ;-)
[19:02] <ZykoticK9> _Pb, just an FYI, but whatever grub you installed most recently, is probably in control - so you'll probably have to configure grub in whatever the "other" os is.
[19:02] <sarge1221> Muelli: what does that mean?
[19:02] <Muelli> sarge1221: if you didn't remove the disk yourself then your drive might be faulty.
[19:02] <HoopyFrood> _Pb: try making a grub rescue disk (google it) or use an ubuntu live cd
[19:02] <headkase314> Ridpojken, after changing to your onboard sound see if regular properties still hangs
[19:03] <_Pb> HoopyFrood: ok
[19:03] <ath_> I'm looking for a gnome panel applet to give me sys info, ie: cpu, ram, hdd, network device info, in a simple text format, preferrably a 'gnome panel' applet, anyone know of one?
[19:03] <Ridpojken> headkase314: I can see my sounblaster card or CA0106 that ubuntu calls it, the onboard card is not there.
[19:03] <Ridpojken> headkase314: And no, the sound pref is still "jammed"
[19:03] <sarge1221> Muelli: it auto removed the disk after the burn. i stuck disk back in to check it and got that.
[19:03] <HoopyFrood> _Pb: then reinstall grub
[19:03] <headkase314> Ridpojken, what happens if you test the device in gstreamer-properties?
[19:03] <ZykoticK9> _Pb, reinstalling Grub from Ubuntu might be a good idea (hopefully it will autodetect the other linux during setup)
[19:03] <Ridpojken> headkase314: I get a sound
[19:03] <kamranOman> guys....
[19:03] <kamranOman> what do we have CLAM AV in UBUNTU 10.04 ?
[19:03] <Aemaeth> ?
[19:04] <PCChris> sebsebseb:  Thanks for the links.  I think I might not have the proper Samba packages...just installed smbclient; will see if it works
[19:04] <kamranOman> like windows we can test our AV or IS software using EICAR files...
[19:04] <ZykoticK9> _Pb, you don't need a "grub rescue disk" btw, a livecd would be preferred
[19:04] <kamranOman> how can i test on UBUNTU ?
[19:04] <headkase314> Ridpojken, that's good.  If you can't use the regular sound properties after the successful test in gstreamer-properties do other applications now have proper sound?
[19:04] <voxyn> Hello
[19:04] <sarge1221> Muelli: good chance it might be faulty then? I have for the paste few tried to burn a bunch of ISO's and the only one to actually make through was tinycore XD
[19:04] <voxyn> I have a question can i aisk it here?
[19:04] <_Pb> ZykoticK9: thanks, i'll try that
[19:05] <Muelli> sarge1221: yeah. sounds pretty much like your drive is broken :-/

[19:05] <ubottu> _Pb, please see my private message
[19:05] <synackfin> there's some rogue user-space code that's allocating huge memory (I noticed during strace some mmap calls for 500MB);  I want to breakpoint all "mmap" calls so I can get a stacktrace, is this possible?
[19:05] <HoopyFrood> ZykotickK9: Its the easiest way to determine if the problem is Grub or not
[19:05] <Muelli> sarge1221: check demsg though.
[19:05] <_Pb> thanks!
[19:05] <Muelli> sarge1221: dmesg  even
=== sshc_ is now known as sshc
[19:05] <sarge1221> Muelli: how do oyu check demsg or dmesg?
[19:05] <Muelli> synackfin: yes.
[19:05] <Muelli> sarge1221: open a terminal, type "dmesg"
[19:05] <voxyn> i want to experiment with the kde window manager if i install it will it make ubuntu much slower or will it not effect the performance?
[19:06] <Ridpojken> headkase314: Yup
[19:06] <ZykoticK9> voxyn, minimal to no effect
[19:06] <_Pb> ZykoticK9, HoopyFrood: oh man, i was doing something stupid and just figured it out. i'll still try that to get ubuntu to show up on the boot list though, thanks!
[19:06] <headkase314> Ridpojken, ok does that resolve a "no sound" condition for you and a separate issue is that the regular sound properties hangs?
[19:06] <voxyn> okey what is the best way to install kde?
[19:06] <ZykoticK9> _Pb, don't fix what isn't broken ;)
[19:06] <voxyn> can you install it from the ubuntu  software manager?
[19:07] <pheonixman> anyone out there to help...?
[19:07] <_Pb> true

[19:07] <ubottu> pheonixman: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
[19:07] <Ridpojken> headkase314: The reason why i'm trying to get in to the sound prefs is because i want to record from my line input
[19:07] <Ridpojken> headkase314: The problem is, i get no sound
[19:08] <xangua> voxyn: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[19:08] <ZykoticK9> voxyn, install kubuntu-desktop for all kde/kubuntu stuff
[19:08] <Muelli> Ridpojken: check alsamixer, pavucontrol and gstreamer-properties
[19:08] <pheonixman> Ober7, i am trying to delete a folder, its giving me the error "Device or resource busy"
[19:08] <headkase314> Ridpojken, in gstreamer-properties there is also an input section - can you change it there?  I ask because I don't know how to resolve the regular sound properties hanging.
[19:08] <kamranOman> again i  ask ...

[19:08] <kamranOman> anyone knows how to test AV in UBUNTU
[19:08] <kamranOman> I have KLAMAV updated...
[19:08] <sarge1221> Muelli: how do you check demsg?
[19:08] <kamranOman> i can test things in :"windows " ...using EICAR file..
[19:09] <kamranOman> but can i do the same in UBUNTU...
[19:09] <kamranOman> ?
[19:09] <voxyn> zykotick9: thanks a lot! going to install it now! bye
[19:09] <Ridpojken> headkase314: What does the input Test button does? Does it monitor the input to the output?
[19:09] <ikonia> kamranOman: what do you wish to test ?

[19:09] <kamranOman> AV is working or not ? effectiveness....konia
[19:09] <headkase314> Ridpojken, I've never had success with the input test - I just set it to the mic and use a different program to test.

[19:09] <ubottu> kamranOman, please see my private message
[19:09] <headkase314> Ridpojken, or line-in in your case.
[19:09] <sebsebseb> PCChris: ok :)
[19:09] <synackfin> Muelli: ?
[19:10] <headkase314> Ridpojken, but the line-in may be labeled as "Microphone 1" or 2 or so on, test them all.

=== _NG is now known as _ng
[19:10] <Aemaeth> i guess you could download a virus and scan the file? EICAR means nothing to me
[19:10] <Muelli> synackfin: just attach a debugger and break on your desired function. You could also ptrace it manually if you like.
[19:10] <Ridpojken> headkase314: My inputs isn't labeled in gstreamer, so i need to test witch one of them is the line in
[19:10] <sarge1221> Muelli: T_T can you offer some insight in what causes disk drives to go bad? also you can explain how you check demsg? I keep this info for furture reference.
[19:10] <wolfric_> how can i get into a serial terminal?
[19:10] <kamranOman> how to get a virus download
[19:11] <kamranOman> or make a virus script ?
[19:11] <headkase314> Ridpojken, what is the input sound system and what are the choices given for the devices?
[19:11] <Aemaeth> Ridpojken, headkase314 has a good point, once you get into your sounds settings my proper line input was mic 2 not mic 1 which was default
[19:11] <Muelli> wolfric_: you can use screen on your serial device, i.e. screen /dev/ttyS0
[19:11] <ikonia> wolfric_: do you want access to a serial termainal, or do you just want a terminal to access
=== neutrino is now known as tar-
[19:11] <Ridpojken> headkase314: ALSA, and i got four "CA0106" to choose from
[19:12] <wolfric_> ikonia: serial
[19:12] <headkase314> Ridpojken, that sounds hopeful - test each one and see if one succeeds?

[19:13] <headkase314> Ridpojken, sound recorder not having the proper plugins is a separate issue.  What other program that you have installed can test audio input?

[19:20] <headkase314> cesc_, ask someone who knows (I don't know how to check this) if the driver you installed is loaded in your kernel?
[19:20] <ZykoticK9> dri245, you should probably empty the trash properly for the drive in question - over manually deleting the folder
[19:21] <YertleTheTurtle> I'm looking for the menu shown in this blog post: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/fix-for-all-pulseaudio-related-issues.html but the System > Pref > sound menu is different now (Running 10.04) could anyone point me in the right direction?
[19:21] <Aemaeth> jure_, cause it doesn't know yu want to mute your speakers
[19:21] <dri245> trash is empty anyway, ZykoticK9 . and that folder has 3 items in it. i do NOT mean to empty the bin by deleting items manually. i mean if i MAY delete that folder or if that folder is a system folder
[19:21] <cesc_> anyone know how to check if the driver I installed is loaded in my kernel?

[19:23] <headkase314> Ridpojken, What we are attempting right now is getting a different program other than gstreamer-properties to take sound input.  Once a suitable program is found then in gstreamer-properties we will go through each of the four listed devices and test each one.  That is high-level, now lower than that we need to find a suitable program for sound input.

[19:27] <ar0nic> [2:26pm] <Licuadora> Why is Ubuntu so buggY?
[19:27] <mr_daniel> I can't find 'glibc' in synaptic, but I need because of execinfo.h. Or has ubuntu no glibc available?
[19:27] <ar0nic> i don think so mang =|
[19:27] <ar0nic> have you made sure you have the repo its in?
[19:28] <headkase314> Ridpojken, so my suggestion is to explore the ubuntu software center and find an audio recording program.  Once you have that candidate test all four available inputs in gstreamer-properties.  Then as separate issues: the hanging of the regular sound properties and sound recorder not having proper plugins/codecs.  Does this sound like a good break-down to you?
[19:28] <POVaddct> mr_daniel: install the build-essential package
[19:28] <cesc_> ok the output is here guys.. http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/fRHMprf1

[19:29] <ar0nic> never heard taht one before
[19:29] <mr_daniel> just searched for 'build-essentials', but the package is already installed.
[19:29] <cesc_> so I suspect it is loaded in kernel then

[19:31] <sebsebseb> Licuadora: bubby?  you mean buggy?
[19:31] <gochilla> hey, i have a general question. can someone help me understanding why there's a huge difference in the sum of all the process memory usages (resident memory) and the result of a 'free' call?
[19:31] <IdleOne> Licuadora: Do you have a question or just feel like ranting?
[19:31] <HoopyFrood> I installed Lucid and Grub to an external hard drive, but whenever I boot to the hard drive, the grub rescue screen appears. I have tried installing grub onto the drive from ubuntu, another copy of which I have on my internal drive, and manually replacing the grub folder as root, both without success
[19:32] <Kjeldor> hello, can i use/run itunes on ubuntu?
[19:32] <Licuadora> cyeah buggy. Then again I cant go back to Windows
[19:32] <HoopyFrood> no
[19:32] <mr_daniel> wait a minute, I just tested to compile a c-code-snippet and it works, when I #include <execinfo.h>. There must be something wrong with the ./configure script I use
=== the_rogue_smiler is now known as Lap_dragon
[19:32] <sebsebseb> Licuadora: October 10th is the 10.10 release,  also there are other distros that can be used instead, that might work better for you
[19:32] <HoopyFrood> Kjeldor: no
[19:32] <Aemaeth> 10/10 10.10 cute
[19:32] <sebsebseb> Kjeldor: maybe just about in Wine, if not a Windows virtual machine yes :)
[19:32] <ZykoticK9> Aemaeth, actually it's 10.10.10 for date ;)
[19:33] <Licuadora> sebsebseb: NAh, i tryed Sabyon, and is a whole different thing.
[19:33] <tdlm> okay guys, how do i undo a mount --bind?
[19:33] <Aemaeth> ZykoticK9, yeah, just remembered what year it is, are they trying to create some sort of 2012 scenario by tempting fate?
[19:33] <Muelli> tdlm: umount
[19:33] <dhani> i dont think so...
[19:33] <dhani> try Ultimate Edition
[19:33] <sebsebseb> Licuadora: Sabayon is alright, but probably not really the best one for newbies to start with
[19:33] <Kjeldor> so how exaclty do i do this? i have wine installed, and im downloading itunes right now. ill install itunes later?
[19:33] <tdlm> Muelli: i tried umount but it says 'device busy'
[19:33] <Muelli> tdlm: well. maybe the device is busy then ;-) Try umount -l
[19:34] <Licuadora> sebsebseb: even Ubuntu Studio, studio64, they all suck. The only one good is Ubuntu, but... it is so unstable
[19:34] <dhani> guys...
[19:34] <tdlm> Muelli: you are amazing
[19:34] <tdlm> thank you
[19:34] <cesc_> headkase314 I think the drivers are loaded in kernel check this http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/fRHMprf1   line 3 is the chipset for my wireless usb driver
[19:34] <aeon-ltd> Licuadora: say wut?
[19:34] <tdlm> i HATE that feeling
[19:34] <Muelli> tdlm: :-) Glad it helped.
[19:34] <WhitePelican> hi, I like ubuntu but use some kde apps. how do I update to kde 4.5 without installing kubuntu?
[19:34] <Aemaeth> what is ubuntu studio, i've seen it in the repositories but it looked like it was going to overwrite some of my settings so i let it be
[19:34] <tdlm> +Muelli
[19:34] <sebsebseb> Licuadora: no loads of good distros out there that are newbie friendly,  some are more user friendly than Ubuntu really even http://www.distrowatch.com :)
[19:34] <aeon-ltd> Licuadora: yeah the spin offs suck, except crunchband and mint but ubuntu stock is pretty stable
[19:34] <tdlm> if that works here
[19:34] <tdlm> haha
[19:35] <aeon-ltd> *crunchbang
[19:35] <Oer> Licuadora, no problem here, stable.

[19:37] <headkase314> Ridpojken, in a terminal: "gstreamer-properties" without quotes
[19:37] <ar0nic> Licuadora have you even attempted to google your problem
[19:37] <no_u0> i've installed Pound, but idk where it is
[19:37] <ar0nic> "computer wont shut down properly ubuntu"
[19:37] <Licuadora> ar0nic: PFFF. then whats this channel for!?
[19:37] <no_u0> how can i runit
[19:38] <HoopyFrood> Kjeldor: what version of ubuntu are you running?
[19:38] <ar0nic> not holding your hand
[19:38] <xangua> ar0nic: that's very vague S:
[19:38] <ar0nic> its for when all esle fails
[19:38] <ar0nic> lol
[19:38] <ar0nic> xangua kidna
[19:38] <Oer> Licuadora, maybe it is a BIOS preference, ACPI S1 or S3
[19:38] <Aemaeth> i thought Licuadora was more upset about genreal problems
[19:38] <Licuadora> Well, this is one kinnda of a problem, the system wont turn off
[19:38] <collabra> Licuadora: these channels are just as much for advertising and promotion as they are for technical help.... I'm truly sorry you've had a bad experience with ubuntu
[19:39] <pelmen> guys, after upgrade to 2.6.32-24 destop now boots much slower, than used to. Everything is as fast until xserver starts. Than black screen. 5 seconds... i see mouse pointer...5 seconds...i see background...5 seconds.. i see gnome panels. boot finished. ?
[19:39] <ar0nic> thats not true collabra
[19:39] <collabra> ar0nic: what
[19:39] <pil> hello everyone - two days ago , I couldn't connect to this server - it was saying that some kind of botnet connected from my ip address - do you know any malware remover program to scan my system for malwares?
[19:39] <ar0nic> that these channels are for adverts and promotions
[19:39] <Oer> pelmen do you use a SSD ?
=== Bridge|A is now known as Bridge|
[19:39] <headkase314> Licuadora, as a work-around you can hold the power-button on the system for 5 seconds and it will shut off.  If the shutdown sequence makes it as far as unmounting the filesystem then you can do this with no issues.
[19:39] <pelmen> Oer: nope
[19:39] <t3chi3> wtf is up with ubuntus updates screwing with vbox clipboards and home keys?
[19:40] <Aemaeth> why does my sound preferences look different than some i've seen in images?  mine doesn't have settings for theme sounds
=== bryan is now known as Guest62967
[19:40] <xangua> !language | t3chi3
[19:40] <ubottu> t3chi3: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
[19:40] <coz_> Aemaeth,  are you trying to change sounds ?
[19:40] <Licuadora> headkase314: i can turn it off like that, but i want to do it the right way
[19:40] <ZykoticK9> pil, you where probably picked up by accident by the Freenode bot "idora" or similar - it probably wasn't malware on your system, just bad timing
[19:40] <t3chi3> fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
[19:40] <coz_> ??
[19:41] <Aemaeth> yeah, i can change them by replacing the current files, but that seems like a roundabout way of doing that
[19:41] <collabra> ar0nic: so acording to you,.... this channel doesn't promote ubuntu?... yeah, believe what you want....
[19:41] <xangua> pelmen: try to boot with an older kernel; press Alt when booting to see the grub menu
[19:41] <pil> ZykoticK9: you sure?
[19:41] <coz_> Aemaeth,  are they working when you do that?
[19:41] <Licuadora> You know waht? forget it, i'll intall the distro again, for the 15th time
[19:41] <ZykoticK9> pil, no
[19:41] <icedwater> Hello, need some tips troubleshooting my sound settings. Earphones don't seem to work on Lucid, they work fine on my MP3 or Windows 7.
[19:41] <Aemaeth> coz_, mostly, system logout doesn't seem to ever play
[19:41] <icedwater> Not sure what has changed.
[19:41] <xangua> collabra: this is a channel for ubuntu support, ONLY ubuntu
[19:41] <headkase314> Licuadora, I hear you - sometimes my system doesn't shutdown too - started happening when I connected my computer through HDMI to my HDTV.  That's unresolved for me too..  Work in progress.
[19:41] <Aemaeth> but i think that's with the default ogg too
[19:41] <Oer> xangua press shift for grubmenu ?
[19:41] <karlo> How can I make windows transparent when moving them ?
[19:41] <coz_> Aemaeth,   right I have had the same issues here...  without great results
[19:41] <pil> ZykoticK9: do you know any malware remover programs for ubuntu?
[19:42] <ZykoticK9> !virus | pil
[19:42] <ubottu> pil: Antivirus is something you don't need on !Linux, except where files are then passed to windows computers (perhaps using samba), See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus
[19:42] <coz_> Aemaeth,  I know that maverick is calling for new sound themes if you are interested in creating some
[19:42] <HoopyFrood> I installed Lucid and Grub to an external hard drive, but whenever I boot to the hard drive, the grub rescue screen appears. I have tried installing grub onto the drive from ubuntu, another copy of which I have on my internal drive, and manually replacing the grub folder as root, both without success
[19:42] <xangua> Oer: is shift <unconvertable> i thought it was alt :S sorry pelmen
[19:42] <ubuntu-usr> hi all
[19:42] <coz_> Aemaeth,  they were suppose to be on lucid but mark shuttleworth forgot about them :)
[19:42] <blackMatrix> hi, im booting ubuntu from a flash drive, is there a way to access windows files while still on ubuntu OS
[19:42] <xangua> karlo: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager < configure compiz plugins with that
[19:42] <Aemaeth> me and my buddy could make the supreme portal theme (by our standards)
[19:43] <sebsebseb> blackMatrix: I think so
[19:43] <sebsebseb> blackMatrix: places > windows partition ?
[19:43] <xangua> blackMatrix: just mount window's partition
[19:43] <ZykoticK9> blackMatrix, usually yes.  click on the Places menu, do you see any drives/partitions?
[19:43] <Aemaeth> but really it just seemed ridiculous that we had to investigate so much just to mess around with audio
[19:43] <pil> ubottu, ZykoticK9: so like ZykoticK9 said that it was only bad timing for me that day not connecting to the server?
[19:43] <ubottu> Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[19:43] <ubuntu-usr> i'm using uck-gui (ubuntu custumization kit) but i option with synaptic isn't avaible, what to enable it?
[19:43] <coz_> Aemaeth,  here are two links  http://design.canonical.com/2010/08/ubuntu-needs-a-new-sound-theme/  and this is where you sould post them   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Design/SoundTheme/Submissions-11-04?action=quicklink
[19:44] <Aemaeth> kk
[19:44] <ZykoticK9> pil, you could ask in the #freenode channer they would know more
[19:44] <ZykoticK9> s/channer/channel
[19:44] <ikonia> ubuntu-usr: please ask that again a little more clear
[19:44] <pil> ZykoticK9: thanks
[19:44] <blackMatrix> ok, i will try that...any risks i should be aware of while mounting the windows partition ?
[19:44] <cesc_> guys I explain my issue again for everyone. I have a usb wireless adapter (Alfa Network model AWUS036H). I have downloaded the drivers for it from Realteak because it uses chipset 8187L. After some problems with compiling the drivers I have succeeded and rebooted my machine. After logging in again... I unplugged my wired internet connection, went to terminal windows and typed iwconfig with no luck.. it says no wireless extensions. The drivers are loaded in the
[19:44] <cesc_>  kernel.
[19:44] <icedwater> !sound
[19:44] <ubottu> If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
[19:44] <hylian> this is probably a strange request, but is there a place where i can just say to the ubuntu community how much i think ubuntu rocks and how much i appreciate all their hard work?
[19:44] <coz_> blackMatrix,  there should be no risks at all
[19:44] <ubuntu-usr> ikonia, what i should explain more?
[19:45] <collabra> xangua: Both of you are missing the bigger point to the 'ubuntu support' channel..... This may be a channel where you can get support for your newly installed ubuntu system,... but It's secondary purpose is in promotion,... look, most people here advocate the use of ubuntu or it's dirivitives.... and thus actively 'promotes' ubuntu.
[19:45] <IdleOne> hylian: you just did :)
[19:45] <ikonia> ubuntu-usr: "i option with synaptic is not available" ?
[19:45] <xangua> hylian: how about offtopic <unconvertable> :)
[19:45] <rek> i don't find my network printer what can i do?
[19:45] <headkase314> cesc_, that is the perfect recap - post that every 5 minutes or so and if no one at this time has an answer post the same thing other times you try here.  Good luck I really hope it can get ironed out soon for you.
[19:46] <hylian> xangua im not talking irc, imeant like a forum, and since it's directly related to ubuntu, i thought it was on topic, sorry.

[19:46] <xangua> hylian: ubutnu forum then <unconvertable>

[19:46] <cesc_> thanks keadkase314 for your advice and help
[19:46] <Oer> ubuntu-usr, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
[19:46] <hylian> ok thanx dude, thanx for helping people out too, we all appreciate it.
[19:47] <IdleOne> hylian: the best way to say thank you is to help out on IRC and forums and spread the love to friends and family
[19:47] <headkase314> cesc_, you're welcome - it really can be luck of the draw for if someone has the knowledge you need in the channel.

[19:50] <DuncanD0nuts> generic dell optical mouse
[19:52] <pure_hate> DuncanD0nuts, Did you boot up with the mouse pluged in , or did you plug it in after you were booted?

I have tried installing grub onto the drive from ubuntu, another copy of which I have on my internal drive, and manually replacing the grub folder as root, both without success
[20:06] <pure_hate> cesc, the best thing to do is create to lsmod text files and then diff them to see what the difference is.
[20:06] <bullhorn> i forgot even the basics of linux lol
[20:06] <Professor_G> hsr,  what do i do again?
[20:06] <bullhorn> i dont remember how to use apt-get and search and whatnot
[20:06] <icedwater> hsr: If you help him, I will be pretty grateful too... I'm probably in the same situation.
[20:06] <coz_> Professor_G,  open a terminal
[20:07] <icedwater> bullhorn: What did you need?
[20:07] <coz_> Professor_G,    type    alsamixer
[20:07] <ZykoticK9> cesc, have you plugged the xubuntu machine into the ethernet network and done all updates?
[20:07] <pure_hate> there should be much difference in the wireless between xubuntu and ubuntu except the GUI wireless manager
[20:07] <coz_> Professor_G,  then check that the sliders are up in volume and none are muted
[20:07] <bullhorn> icedwater, i need to get rid of an old beta version of chrome and find the latest stable one

[20:07] <icedwater> bullhorn: Did you set the Google repository?
[20:07] <cesc> yes Zykotick9 is the first think I have done.. there was 172 updates to catch up. :)

[20:08] <bullhorn> i got this one icedwater : http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/
[20:08] <icedwater> bullhorn: sudo apt-get update I guess? Then sudo apt-get upgrade?
[20:08] <ZykoticK9> cesc, ok - just trying to account for difference in hardware support (ubuntu & xubuntu "should" support the same hardware)

[20:12] <Shakey_Jake> kyo: which version of ubuntu are you running?
[20:13] <kyo> ubuntu 9.04
[20:13] <headkase314> hsr, for rhythmbox in synaptic search for "rhythmbox radio browser"
[20:13] <headkase314> hsr, and don't forget to enable it in the plug-in settings of rhythmbox - it does shoutcast, icecast, etc.
[20:13] <Shakey_Jake> have you tried system>preferences>sound>output ?
[20:14] <ilul> d09eat90d bang?
[20:14] <cesc> pure_hate here http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/mZ7fx9V3 the lsmod file in my ubuntu machine where Alfa Network wireless adapter worked straight away. And here http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/fRHMprf1  lsmod file for my xubuntu machine where I'm having problems with.
[20:14] <hsr> headkase314: Does it allow to download as well?
[20:14] <ilul> <d09eat90d>
[20:14] <headkase314> hsr, it allows you to record streams as they play
[20:14] <magicianlord> what is responsible for the native resolution in console, without nouveau being installed?
[20:15] <magicianlord> is it hte kms within the kernel
[20:15] <magicianlord> or what
=== _ng is now known as _NG
[20:15] <kyo> Jake: yes I did, but nothing happen
[20:16] <hsr> headkase314: Well i listen to RadioParadise and SKY.fm using their links in m3u format... will it work?
[20:16] <Kjeldor> i cant find the laucher for the libimobiledevice after installing it from the PPA
[20:16] <kyo> should I change something in "/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base"
[20:16] <kyo> ?
[20:16] <headkase314> hsr, rhythmbox radio browser is self-contained and only does radio - I do not believe but am not sure that you can point it at sky.fm
[20:16] <Shakey_Jake> there's nothing in either the 'choose a device' box or the connector menu that look like they could be your speakers?
[20:16] <magicianlord> does anyone know if MOC plays streaming audio? radio, for example
[20:17] <Shakey_Jake> well, that's the ext option if there isn't a friendly gui of doing things
[20:17] <hsr> headkase314: Is there a plugin like that for Amarok?
[20:17] <headkase314> hsr, that specific plug-in is for rhythmbox I don't doubt that there is something similar for Amarok I just don't know what it would be.
[20:18] <pure_hate> cesc, thats a mess but try this: rmmod r8187l && modprobe ar9170usb && ifconfig wlan0 up
[20:18] <HoopyFrood> I installed Lucid and Grub to an external hard drive, but whenever I boot to the hard drive, the grub rescue screen appears. I have tried installing grub onto the drive from ubuntu, another copy of which I have on my internal drive, and manually replacing the grub folder as root, both without success
[20:18] <Kjeldor> i cant find the laucher for the libimobiledevice after installing it from the PPA
[20:19] <fcuk112> i've enabled a share through nautilus with r/w perms, but when i try to copy something from another ubuntu machine i get permission denied - any ideas?
[20:19] <hsr> headkase314: Thanks a lot, i will be able to work it out myself then. If not atleast by seeing the code of that plugin and make one for amarok.. Thanks
[20:19] <headkase314> hsr, you're welcome - good hunting.
[20:19] <wickitsarah> greetings to all
[20:19] <kyo> nothing, still just headphones
[20:20] <magicianlord> wickitsarah: GOOD DAY
[20:20] <charlesno> how does IRC work
[20:20] <Arcidias> it is magick
[20:20] <ikonia> charlesno: just ask questions, and people will answer
[20:20] <wickitsarah> im new so please do not get to mad at me ok
[20:20] <Shakey_Jake> kyo: whart's the output from 'cat /proc/asound/cards' ??
[20:20] <headkase314> !ask | wickitsarah
[20:20] <ubottu> wickitsarah: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
[20:21] <Kjeldor> i cant find the laucher for the libimobiledevice after installing it from the PPA
[20:21] <HoopyFrood> I installed Lucid and Grub to an external hard drive, but whenever I boot to the hard drive, the grub rescue screen appears. I have tried installing grub onto the drive from ubuntu, another copy of which I have on my internal drive, and manually replacing the grub folder as root, both without success
[20:21] <wickitsarah> im still learning how to use this im srry ok
[20:21] <ARGGG> i just installed 9.10 and my secondary monitor does not show up in display how would i be able to get it working im using ati radeon x1300
[20:21] <hsr> headkase314: Ryhthombox allows to point to any station using the url option, it allows to add url of station, thats sufficient. Using mp3/m3u/aac format anyone can find the url.. external radios can work
[20:21] <ikonia> HoopyFrood: what rescue screen
[20:22] <ikonia> HoopyFrood: exactly what do you get on screen
[20:22] <anodesni> ARGGG, opensource or proprietary driver?
[20:22] <charlesno> is ArchLinux as good as Ubuntu?
[20:22] <ARGGG> opensource
[20:22] <kyo> Jake: I have not idea :O
[20:22] <ikonia> charlesno: that's personal opinion, try them both
[20:22] <headkase314> Kjeldor, I believe that is for an ipod or touch or iphone?  If so then libimobiledevice is just so you can plug it into a usb port.  From there you can use rhythmbox to manage the device or something like gtkpod.
[20:22] <Arcidias> HoopyFrood: why don't you add a line to your harddrive instance of GRUB so you can choose to boot from the external?
[20:22] <HoopyFrood> ikonia, instead of the bootloader, it says GRUB rescue >
[20:22] <HoopyFrood> as a command line
[20:22] <headkase314> hsr, well good then? ;)
[20:22] <wickitsarah> im like ubuntu and puppy so far
[20:22] <anodesni> ARGGG, http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature
[20:23] <ikonia> HoopyFrood: ok, so your grub is looking at the wrong partitions for it's menu info
[20:23] <ARGGG> thank you
[20:23] <Kjeldor> oh i see
[20:23] <charlesno> what linux distro is recommended if i want to learn as much as possible about how it works
[20:23] <HoopyFrood> ikonia, why, though?
[20:23] <icedwater> charlesno: Are you new to Linux?
[20:23] <Arcidias> charlesno: LFS
[20:23] <anodesni> ARGGG, according to the page xrandr should work with your card
[20:23] <Arcidias> charlesno: or Slackware
[20:23] <ikonia> HoopyFrood: probably becuase you're using a USB drive and it didn't work out the install info properly
[20:23] <headkase314> Kjeldor, I believe you can search for "gtkpod" in synaptic and that can be used to manage the device - people seem to think that one is the most reliable anyway.
[20:24] <HoopyFrood> ikonia, I reinsatlled it via the terminal on ubuntu on my internal drive
[20:24] <Arcidias> charlesno: ArchLinux is also an option
[20:24] <wickitsarah> try one of those tick books fr begainers
[20:24] <HoopyFrood> ikonia, it being grub
[20:24] <charlesno> I'm kind of new, I've been using Ubuntu for a few months but i haven't forced myself to really learn the terminal or anything
[20:24] <icedwater> charlesno: I would say Ubuntu is just fine... learn step by step instead of jumping in at the deep end.
[20:24] <ikonia> charlesno: this channel supports the ubuntu operating system - not general discussion
[20:24] <ikonia> HoopyFrood: then you've installed it to look at the wrong places
[20:24] <anodesni> ARGGG, what output does "xrandr -q" give?
[20:24] <Kjeldor> synaptic is where?
[20:24] <charlesno> I apologize ikonia
[20:24] <ikonia> charlesno: no need to apologize
[20:24] <icedwater> charlesno: Bring it to #ubuntu-offtopic ?
[20:24] <pure_hate> charlesno, Gentoo and then Linux from Scratch if you *really* want to learn
[20:24] <wickitsarah> scotty beam us up lol
[20:24] <ARGGG> anodesni not sure what that means
[20:25] <hibliss> I need some help with Samba on Ubuntu server 10.04
[20:25] <headkase314> Kjeldor, System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager
[20:25] <HoopyFrood> ikonia, so the automatic installation went wrong... :( I can maually edit grub.cfg, then, I guess
[20:25] <ikonia> HoopyFrood: that won't do anything
[20:25] <hibliss> just updated and got a new kernel
[20:25] <hibliss> and Samba started acting up
[20:25] <HoopyFrood> ikonia, so how should I reconfigure it?
[20:25] <headkase314> Kjeldor, then there is a search box at the top you can type gtkpod in and in the results window right-click on gtkpod and choose install
[20:25] <ikonia> !grub2 > HoopyFrood
[20:25] <ubottu> HoopyFrood, please see my private message
[20:25] <anodesni> ARGGG, you should open a terminal and type in "xrandr -q" and then look which devices it discovers
[20:26] <charlesno> thanks guys, goin to off topic
[20:26] <ARGGG> ok
[20:26] <hibliss> I can still access the shares from a windows machine
[20:26] <hibliss> by mapping directly
[20:26] <Kjeldor> thanks.. doing it now
[20:26] <HoopyFrood> ikonia, already checked that link
[20:26] <headkase314> Kjeldor, ok
[20:26] <anodesni> ARGGG, you should see something like VGA connected, LVDS connected
[20:26] <ikonia> HoopyFrood: ok, so then you understand how to point grub at the right parrtitions
[20:26] <d09eat90d> can someone guide me to configure tor+vidalia for lucid lynx??
[20:26] <anodesni> ARGGG, then you know if ubuntu has detected your secondary screen
[20:27] <HoopyFrood> ikonia, right, and it hasnt worked
[20:27] <DasEi> d09eat90d: sure
[20:27] <ARGGG> anodesni yes i see its not seeing my tv
[20:27] <ikonia> HoopyFrood: then you've not configured it right, or the ubuntu partition is corrupt/damaged
[20:27] <headkase314> !info gtkpod
[20:27] <ubottu> gtkpod (source: gtkpod): manage songs and playlists on an Apple iPod. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.99.14-2ubuntu4 (lucid), package size 252 kB, installed size 660 kB
[20:27] <HoopyFrood> ikonia, damn... well, I'll give it another shot
[20:28] <HoopyFrood> ikonia, before i reinstall
[20:28] <hibliss> anyone have a sec to help me out with Samba
[20:28] <DasEi> d09eat90d: tor already installed ?
[20:28] <Kjeldor> headkase314: im done, whats next?
[20:28] <ARGGG> DVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) anodesni
[20:28] <aruntomar> hi guys. my top output shows 2 contradictory values.... so i got confused and need clarification. my cpu usage on the top 3rd line shows that it's using hardly 3% but in the process list it shows that my virtualbox is using 112% cpu usage, so which one is correct
[20:29] <headkase314> Kjeldor, now look in your Applications Menu and I believe you will see gtkpod under Sound & Video
[20:29] <anodesni> ARGGG, are you sure they are turned on?
[20:29] <jonathan> hi
[20:29] <ARGGG> if i have the tv connected when i start up it will make my monitor go black and the tv will flicker in black and white
[20:29] <HoopyFrood> headkase314, I didn't think gtkpod worked with iphones...
[20:29] <DasEi> d09eat90d: ??
[20:30] <hsr> Professor_G: Sorry, i coudn't find the a proper solution
[20:30] <hsr> Professor_G: Sorry, i coudn't find a proper solution
[20:30] <headkase314> HoopyFrood, are you sure?
[20:30] <jonathan> exit
[20:30] <anodesni> ARGGG, you could try the proprietary drivers and configure the tv-out using "sudo amdcccle" in the terminal
[20:30] <headkase314> HoopyFrood, I think in the preferences of gtkpod you can choose a model of device to connect to?
[20:30] <HoopyFrood> headkase314, thats what I thought i saw at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPod
[20:30] <hsr> headkase314: Hey
[20:31] <Kjeldor> headkase314: I dont see my iphone inside
[20:31] <anodesni> ARGGG, this is similar to the amd catalyst suite in windows
[20:31] <hsr> headkase314: Is there any way to monitor network media?
[20:31] <HoopyFrood> headkase314, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone reccomends libmobiledevice
[20:31] <ARGGG> how do i install the proprietary drivers?
[20:31] <ikonia> ARGGG: open the system -> administration -> hardware drivers tool
[20:32] <ARGGG> ok
[20:32] <headkase314> Kjeldor, see HoopyFrood link above and to confirm what exactly is the device?  And in gtkpod under Edit > Preferences can you choose the model of your device.  I'm not in front of gtkpod right now so preferences may be in another location.
[20:32] <HoopyFrood> headkase314, I tried to help Kjeldor with this before
[20:32] <anodesni> ARGGG, it's in system->administration -> proprietary driver install (or something like that)
[20:32] <HoopyFrood> He couldnt find the launcher
[20:32] <headkase314> HoopyFrood, he has libmobiledevice installed but now needs a management front-end for the device
[20:32] <magicianlord> IS it better to remove the battery from a laptop at 50% charge for 6 months plus storage, or leave it connected
[20:32] <cesc> headkase314 how do I remove the driver I installed before.. the realteak rtl8187l. I think it must be the rtl8187 without the final l
[20:33] <HoopyFrood> headkase314, I dont know of any...
[20:33] <headkase314> !infor rmmod
[20:33] <headkase314> !info rmmod
[20:33] <ubottu> Package rmmod does not exist in lucid
[20:33] <headkase314> cesc, I'm not sure but I think it's rmmod <devicename>
[20:33] <DasEi> magicianlord: not ubuntu related, load it to 100% and recharge latest half a year
[20:33] <istvan> I have a powermac g4 running 10.04 that I just set up. It connects to the network with wireless just fine, but I can't get ethernet to work. I have other ubuntu/windows machines that are online via ethernet just fine. ideas?
[20:34] <ARGGG> not able to select anything in hardware drivers
[20:34] <anodesni> ARGGG, I think your card is too old and is not supported anymore by amd/ati
[20:35] <ARGGG> indeed that was what i was haveing troubles with
[20:35] <Kjeldor> headkase314: i couldnt find inside the preference where i could select what device i have
[20:35] <syslq> headkase314: did that guy solved sound problems later?
[20:35] <hsr> headkase314: ther?
[20:35] <headkase314> Kjeldor, what exactly is the device model?
[20:36] <anodesni> ARGGG, it's strange though since the open source drivers should support tv-out for your card

[20:38] <urbmen> nicely nicely
[20:38] <ikonia> jeromel: he's long gone
[20:38] <hsr> Who was asking about headphone issues here??
[20:38] <anodesni> ARGGG, it seems more people are having this problem
[20:39] <Kjeldor> can I just run itunes onto something? while runing UBUNTU?
[20:39] <hsr> Who was asking about headphone issues here??
[20:39] <hsr> Who was asking about headphone issues here??
[20:39] <ikonia> Kjeldor: no
[20:39] <Kjeldor> not even on WINE?
[20:40] <urbmen> just wondering if anyone can help then, I've just installed ubuntu 8.4, and I am struggling to get the flash player to work
[20:40] <TheWhitePelican> oops
[20:40] <TheWhitePelican> sorry
[20:40] <headkase314> Kjeldor, iTunes on WINE -> http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=1347
[20:40] <xangua> urbmen: get it from adobe's web or update lo lucid ;)
[20:40] <headkase314> Kjeldor, from the ratings it doesn't work the best but maybe it can work enough
[20:41] <ImaLamer> try #winehq
[20:41] <ActionParsnip> urbmen: what browser?
[20:41] <AndrewMC> urbmen: Why such an old version of ubuntu
[20:41] <ActionParsnip> xangua: no need
[20:41] <ActionParsnip> AndrewMC: hardy is still supported
[20:41] <urbmen> firefox 3.6.8
[20:41] <xangua> ActionParsnip: update to lucid <unconvertable> just saying ;) it's awesome
[20:41] <AndrewMC> ActionParsnip: Oh ok
[20:42] <ActionParsnip> hardy is supported until April 2011
[20:42] <urbmen> its just the disk i had to hand
[20:42] <ActionParsnip> so its not old by any means, it gets updates just like the others
[20:42] <AndrewMC> ActionParsnip: Still its an old version
[20:43] <urbmen> it works and it stable
[20:43] <IdleOne> upgrading to lucid won't fix the issue
=== Genlan is now known as Eenix
[20:43] <Arcidias> AndrewMC: you're disputing another man's choice of distro?
[20:43] <ActionParsnip> AndrewMC: true but its stillup to date with updates
[20:43] <IdleOne> !flash | urbmen
[20:43] <ubottu> urbmen: To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash - See also  !Restricted and !Gnash
[20:43] <AndrewMC> ActionParsnip: Thats a good point
[20:43] <d09eat90d> googleearth bugs on lucid
[20:43] <ActionParsnip> urbmen: if you run: sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree     does it install?
[20:43] <d09eat90d> it's installed but it won't run
[20:43] <ActionParsnip> !info flashplugin-nonfree hardy
[20:43] <ubottu> flashplugin-nonfree (source: flashplugin-nonfree): Adobe Flash Player plugin installer. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 10.0.1.218+really9.0.280.0ubuntu1 (hardy), package size 18 kB, installed size 164 kB (Only available for i386 amd64 lpia)
[20:45] <ActionParsnip> urbmen: if you install ubuntu-restricted-extras    it will install flash and java too for you
[20:45] <Kjeldor> so how do i open itunesetup.exe with wine? or something?
[20:45] <luw> hi question:  why on ubuntu's website it says "not recommended for daily desktop use" for the 10.04 64bit version?
[20:45] <urbmen> cheers
[20:45] <Arcidias> Kjeldor: cd to the directory of itunesetup.exe and execute wine itunesetup.exe
[20:45] <rww> luw: because Ubuntu's website developers don't know what they're talking about and are bad at fixing bugs
[20:45] <Kjeldor> how?
[20:46] <Arcidias> Kjeldor: open Terminal
[20:46] <elkclone> luw: lmao
[20:46] <magicianlord> is lpia available for 10.04?
[20:46] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: is it itunes 7 or 8?
[20:46] <Kjeldor> newest
[20:46] <rww> magicianlord: no
[20:46] <ActionParsnip> magicianlord: http://news.softpedia.com/news/Canonical-Drops-Support-for-LPIA-on-Ubuntu-10-04-128175.shtml
[20:46] <Kjeldor> newest itunes
[20:46] <luw> rww: interesting...it's kinda ridiculous that they would put that
[20:46] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: i dont use apples garbage, you need to be the smart one here dude
[20:47] <Kjeldor> so what do i do?
[20:47] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/03/sync-iphone-and-ipod-touch-in-ubuntu.html
[20:47] <IdleOne> Kjeldor: where did you save the file to?
[20:47] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: or get a better player (easier)
[20:47] <Kjeldor> in DOWNLOADS
[20:47] <thune3> luw: this statement is a screen, if you believe it you are likely too new to linux to deal with additional(minor) issues that sometimes come with 64-bit installation.
[20:48] <IdleOne> Kjeldor: ok in terminal type cd ~/Downloads
[20:48] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: using that guide will let you use rhythmnbox
[20:48] <Kjeldor> i dont want rythymnbox
[20:48] <Kjeldor> IdleOne: then?
[20:48] <luw> thune3: statement screen?  what other minor issues should one be worried about running the 64bit kernel?
[20:49] <IdleOne> Kjeldor: now type: wine itunesetup.exe
[20:49] <IdleOne> Kjeldor: assuming you already installed wine
[20:49] <Kjeldor> kjeldor@kjeldor-laptop:~$ cd ~/downloads
[20:49] <Kjeldor> bash: cd: /home/kjeldor/downloads: No such file or directory
[20:49] <ActionParsnip> luw: some hardware manufacturers only make 32bit drivers. Some apps from 3rd party sources dont have 64bit support
[20:49] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: its a capital D
[20:49] <rww> Kjeldor: capital D in Downloads
[20:50] <Arcidias> Kjeldor: Downloads with capital D
[20:50] <IdleOne> Kjeldor: I said cd ~/Downloads
[20:50] <Kjeldor> sorry
[20:50] <IdleOne> not downloads
[20:50] <IdleOne> linux is case sensitive :)
[20:50] <ActionParsnip> !case
[20:50] <ubottu> File names in Ubuntu are case sensitive, MyFile is not the same as myfile, and if you put spaces in there and use a console you need to "escape" the space, thus "gedit My\ File.txt"
[20:50] <Kjeldor> its my first day =)
[20:50] <IdleOne> no problem
[20:50] <istvan> I have a powermac g4 running 10.04 that I just set up. It connects to the network with wireless just fine, but I can't get ethernet to work. I have other ubuntu/windows machines that are online via ethernet just fine. ideas?
[20:50] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: i'll put money on itunes failing badly
[20:51] <IdleOne> yup
[20:51] <rubbahdawg> oi, someone who can help me with meim trying to play a bit around with renoise on my friend's linux computer but he's got zero idea of how to use the os himself
[20:51] <ActionParsnip> istvan: does the interface get an IP address?
[20:51] <blackMatrix1> hi all. when you boot ubuntu from flash drive and install apache2, mysql etc and turn off the power and bring it back up, does it loose all the installations ?
[20:51] <luw> ActionParsnip: oh ok, now that does make sense.  i was stuck on what was unstable about ubuntu and was considering them their own thing.
[20:51] <urbmen> hello again I have installed the flashplugin-nonfree, I have closed and opened mozilla and I still can not view youtube or tv catch up
[20:52] <istvan> ActionParsnip, under the conenctons menu tool it just says 'disconnected'
[20:52] <Arcidias> blackMatrix1: depends, if it is a live usb - yes, but if it has a persistence option - then yes
[20:52] <xangua> !usb
[20:52] <xangua> if is not a persistent install, yes urbmen
[20:52] <ubottu> For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[20:52] <luw> but i guess youre right, you cant really do that
[20:52] <IdleOne> Kjeldor: when you get a bunch of errors while wine is trying to install itunes you will understand why ActionParsnip suggested Rhythmbox
=== JanC_ is now known as JanC
[20:52] <ActionParsnip> istvan: screw that, run: ifconfig   do you see an address for your adapter
[20:52] <Arcidias> blackMatrix1: the former was a "no"
[20:52] <urbmen> just for the record I have basic level experience with ubuntu
[20:53] <blackMatrix1> Arcidias: where do you change the settings for persistence
[20:53] <Arcidias> well you must have a casper-rw loop file
[20:53] <izatt82> hello to the IRC world
[20:53] <rubbahdawg> i need help installing the "real time threads" for sound buffering or something like that, but i dont get how to write in the config as im asked to do in the readme
[20:53] <Kjeldor> but I also want to sync my apps
[20:53] <Kjeldor> =(
[20:53] <Arcidias> hi izatt82
[20:53] <nUboon2Age> Kjeldor: just fyi, last i checked the newest itunes wine was succesfull with was 7.3 i think.
[20:53] <batbrat> I am trying to install freeglut3 and libqt4-dev on my Dell Inspiron 15R without also installing the mesa packages. My laptop has an ATI Radeon HD5470 card and I already have fglrx-dev. What is a good workaround?
[20:53] <ActionParsnip> urbmen: ok can you give the output of:   lsb_release -a; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; ; dpkg -l | grep swf
[20:53] <izatt82> hello
[20:54] <Arcidias> blackMatrix1: well, when you make the live usb you must tell it to have persistence
[20:54] <Arcidias> blackMatrix1: how did you do it?from windows or linux host?"
[20:54] <urbmen> say again sorry what do you want me to do
[20:54] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: you have a device from one of the most shortsigted and ignorant companies. What did you expect
[20:54] <izatt82> i gave up on installing itunes in wine and just downloaded virtualbox PERL because it has USB support
[20:54] <Arcidias> I second what ActionParsnip said
[20:54] <istvan> ActionParsnip, only an inet6... huh... thats weird. why isn't that working then?
[20:54] <blackMatrix1> Arcidias: you mean when I create the bootable usb I have to set persistence ? I created the CD from Windows host.
[20:55] <rubbahdawg> please someone...
[20:55] <ActionParsnip> istvan: does the interface have flashing lights around the network cable
[20:55] <Ober7> Kjeldor why don't you try and run MS windows in a virtual machine? i have the apple cure too and thats what i do
[20:55] <istvan> ActionParsnip, nope
[20:55] <nUboon2Age> Kjeldor: which might be useful for you still, but just so you know wine isn't able to run newer versions of itunes.  you can always check the wine appdb at http://appdb.winehq.com to see if a particular windows program is working on wine yet.
[20:55] <Arcidias> blackMatrix1: oic, then see pendrivelinux.org
[20:55]  * batbrat hopes to solve the problem
[20:55] <magicianlord> Is LPIA available for 10.04
[20:55] <ActionParsnip> istvan: then its not plugged in right, there is a standard that there should be lights around the link. Check the router link light too
[20:55] <Arcidias> blackMatrix1: they have a tool which can make you a persistent usb drive
[20:55] <Ober7> apple curse*
[20:55] <Arcidias> magicianlord: no
[20:56] <Kjeldor> how do i run ms windows in a virtual machine?
[20:56] <nUboon2Age> virtualbox is a pretty good way to run stuff from other OSs.  Its not too bad to figure out Kjeldor.
[20:56] <ActionParsnip> magicianlord: for Canonical themselves: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-November/000643.html
[20:56] <izatt82> dont use virtualbox OSE though it doesn't have USB support. if needing it for the iphone make sure to get virtualbox PERL
[20:56] <Arcidias> magicianlord: as ActionParsnip pasted a link earlier - Canonical dropped support
[20:56] <istvan> ActionParsnip, no, there are no lights on the computer. Also, if i set my netbook up as a bridge and plug this computer into that, it works fine, so it's not HW, it's my home netowork (which i'm not admin of)
[20:56] <Ober7> Kjeldor: use a virtual machine like virtual box
[20:56] <magicianlord> ActionParsnip: since which version
[20:57] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: thats the only real way but it requires a windows license and install media. You will also be running Windows inside ubuntu (quite a lot of bloat)
[20:57] <Arcidias> 10.04
[20:57] <Arcidias> magicianlord: 10.04, as was pointed
[20:57] <Flannel> Arcidias, magicianlord, ActionParsnip: Debian still supports it strongly.
[20:57] <Arcidias> Flannel: the question was about ubuntu and we are in an ubuntu help channel
[20:57] <magicianlord> Arcidias: i'm in terminal, so it's a little hard to type that into links
[20:57] <izatt82> http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-install-windows-7-on-virtualbox/
[20:57] <blackMatrix1> Arcidias: Thank you. I am using the pendrivelinux and I see the option to set persistence. one more question, Is max persistence only 4GB or its because of my usb size ?
[20:57] <Ober7> Kjeldor: like Arcidias said you need to have a legal windows cd or iso
[20:58] <izatt82> its pretty easy to installit
[20:58] <Arcidias> blackMatrix1: it's the maximum size, I'm afraid
[20:58] <ActionParsnip> izatt82: sounds expensive, i'd use a cheap XP license
[20:58] <Kjeldor> so now, how do i uninstall itunes from wine?
[20:58] <Flannel> Arcidias: Of course.  But Ubuntu doesn't support LPIA anymore, so the recommended upgrade path (since I'm not aware of any community supported LPIA effort) is Debian.
[20:58] <rww> magicianlord: It was dropped for 10.04, and pretty bad in 9.10. There is no supported upgrade path for LPIA users; if you have one, you're recommended to reinstall with a sane architecture.
[20:59] <nUboon2Age> magicianlord: here's the ubuntu dev announcement: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-November/000643.html
[20:59] <rww> Flannel: anything that can run LPIA can run x86, afaik?
[20:59] <magicianlord> rww: so it's not worth installing 9.10 over 10.04 on a netbook?
[20:59] <rww> magicianlord: no
[20:59] <Flannel> rww: Ah, is that the case?
[20:59] <blackMatrix1> Arcidias: thats good enough...till I completely move away from all that disk space windows is sitting on :-)
[20:59] <magicianlord> i would still like to try
[20:59] <kyle_> hello peeps. In ubuntu 10.4/Nautilus 2.30.1 How can I search for files in sub dir's.
[20:59] <rww> magicianlord: congratulations. enjoy wasting your time
[20:59] <Arcidias> blackMatrix1: glad to hear it
[21:00] <magicianlord> wasting my time is what i do
[21:00] <Kjeldor> How do I uninstall itunes from wine?
[21:00] <xangua> Kjeldor: apps>wine>uninstall
[21:00] <Arcidias> blackMatrix1: btw, the process of making the 4gb casper loop file takes some time and the progress bar does not move, so sit it out, don't freak out
[21:01] <rww> Flannel: I've never heard of one that didn't, and last time I read anything by Intel about it, they were planning to keep it that way
[21:01] <Sid123> what is a suitable player for playing HD video in lucid (.mkv 11 GB of size) smoothly
[21:01] <izatt82> VLC?
[21:01] <istvan> ActionParsnip, also, uner network connections ipv6 is set to ignore.. so idk why that has an address
[21:01] <magicianlord> is anyone here using 10.04? is it still usuable after the upgrade issues?
[21:01] <xangua> Sid123: are you using a netbook <unconvertable>
[21:02] <xangua> magicianlord: what upgrade issues <unconvertable>
[21:02] <rww> Flannel: I don't see LPIA on http://www.debian.org/ports/ , incidentally.
[21:02] <ActionParsnip> Flannel: http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUK248&q=lpia+10.04&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=     It's pretty much all over :)
[21:02] <magicianlord> xangua: there was some recent update that rendered grub 2 inoperable
[21:02] <Sid123> xangua: NO .I am using a desktop with nvidia GEfore graphics card
[21:03] <xangua> magicianlord: i set up updates every 2 weeks, i hope hen that ehy fix if in teh next 2 weeks S:
[21:03] <Arcidias> Sid123: then VLC
[21:03] <xangua> or mplayer
[21:03] <magicianlord> good idea, but what if the bug happens when you update
[21:04] <izatt82> i use VLC to watch all my video files no matter what type
[21:04] <xangua> magicianlord: does this affects only dual boot systems <unconvertable>
[21:04] <rww> magicianlord: do you have a bug number I can look at?
[21:04] <livingdaylight> guys, I'm on Ubuntu running VB for the first time. I've used it a couple times a couple years back and the setup seems different now as to how I recall it.
[21:05] <Sid123> <Arcidias>i already have tried,but it was not playing smoothly
[21:05] <acathla> Sid123, mplayer with VDPAU
[21:05] <livingdaylight> Basically, I had no trouble finding the .iso and loading it. Now, however, I can't seem to find where or when during the process I create the path to the .iso. Can someone help?
[21:05] <magicianlord> nope
[21:05] <livingdaylight> I dont know when to point VB to the .iso in my downloads folder
[21:05] <rubbahdawg> how does one reach enlightment and attention?
[21:05] <Arcidias> rubbahdawg: E17 has a package in the repos
[21:06] <Arcidias> afaik
[21:06] <BiNhOw> hi
[21:06] <BiNhOw> i`m from brazil
[21:06] <BiNhOw> looking girls..
[21:06] <rubbahdawg> arcidias, sorry what?
[21:06] <izatt82> livinglight goto settings and then click on storage
[21:06] <ikonia> BiNhOw: please look elsewhere
[21:06] <maco> BiNhOw: wrong place
[21:06] <rubbahdawg> repos?, im veeery new to linux
[21:06] <ikonia> BiNhOw: this channel is for ubuntu support only
[21:06] <kyle_> if i do that can I thin say i want to move them all to one folder.
[21:06] <maco> rubbahdawg: repos = repositories. servers full of software
[21:06] <BiNhOw> ikonia sorry
[21:06] <Sid123> acathla: what is VDPAU .does it support all graphics card?
[21:06] <batbrat> Um, do GL/gl.h and GL/glu.h come with the fglrx-dev package? That seems to be the issue
[21:06] <Arcidias> rubbahdawg: weren't you asking about Enlightenment17 the window manager?
[21:07] <batbrat> Can someone please help me figure this out?
[21:07] <acathla> Sid123, let me find some URLs for you
[21:07] <istvan> ActionParsnip, http://pastebin.com/biL47eXt <-- there. that might be more helpful than my explaining
[21:07] <rubbahdawg> arcidias, no sorry, i was jokin coz i tried to reach attention about my sound problem earlier
[21:07] <Sid123> <acathla>ok
[21:07] <rubbahdawg> im trying to use renoise, but i got problems with installing "real time threads"
[21:07] <acathla> Sid123, table for supported nvidia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_PureVideo
[21:08] <rubbahdawg> could you help me if i specify a bit further?
[21:08] <Arcidias> rubbahdawg: I'm afraid I am of no use to you there, my friend
[21:08] <nUboon2Age> livingdaylight: i can try.  are you just trying to figure out the path to a file?
[21:08] <ActionParsnip> istvan: i'd try a known good cable, or try a different port on the router
[21:08] <ActionParsnip> istvan: check the connection LED on the router is lit
[21:08] <cesc_> guys I decided to install driver RTL8187 instead of RTL8187L which I installed earlier on.
[21:09] <livingdaylight> nUboon2Age, yes
[21:09] <istvan> ActionParsnip, the cable is fine, as i said it connects to the bridged laptop fine. also, if i read that ifconfig correctly it shows some packets both for read and write?
[21:09] <nUboon2Age> livingdaylight: clarification: are you saying you're using Visual Basic on Ubuntu?
[21:09] <cesc_> when trying to compile the driver ...... I got this output... let me pastebin it.
[21:09] <livingdaylight> nUboon2Age, Virtual Box
[21:09] <Arcidias> nUboon2Age: VirtualBox
[21:09] <nUboon2Age> livingdaylight: ah virtualbox
[21:09] <ActionParsnip> istvan: it is recieving packets, try setting the ipv4 address manually
[21:10] <Arcidias> livingdaylight: you want to boot from the iso in your Downloads folder, right?
[21:10] <livingdaylight> Arcidias, yes
[21:10] <magicianlord> What is planned for 10.10?
[21:10] <ActionParsnip> !maverick | magicianlord
[21:10] <ubottu> magicianlord: Maverick Meerkat is the codename for Ubuntu 10.10, due October 2010 - Maverick is Not released and Not Stable, discussion and support in #ubuntu+1
[21:10] <Sid123> <acathla:will xbmc do it?
[21:10] <Arcidias> magicianlord: Gnome3!
[21:10] <istvan> ActionParsnip, do i need to reboot or just hit apply after that? (and should i use the gui?)
[21:10] <nUboon2Age> livingdaylight: i think Arcidias may be of more help.  i've used virtualbox but not enough to be that much help.
[21:10] <magicianlord> Gnome 3 would be nice.
[21:11] <Arcidias> livingdaylight: then make a new machine, by clicking the New button up left
[21:11] <rubbahdawg> arcidias, do you have any idea what it mans when it says, " To enable RT thread creation via PAM open the /etc/security/limits.conf file as root (or via sudo)."
[21:11] <ActionParsnip> istvan: you can use any method you like, shouldnt need a reboot. Linux is designed to not need reboots
[21:11] <Arcidias> rubbahdawg: no idea
[21:11] <rubbahdawg> darned, thank you anyway
[21:11] <acathla> Sid123, yes, I think, never tried. With 10.04, you just install some libs and type "mplayer -vo vdpau -vc ffh264vdpau youfile.mkv"
[21:11] <Arcidias> livingdaylight: follow everything till you have completed the setup, then click on the name of your setup
[21:11] <acathla> there are some tutorial for ubuntu
[21:11] <livingdaylight> Arcidias, I assigned the name, memory and hd size..
[21:11] <livingdaylight> Arcidias, just need to create the path to the .iso from which I will boot and install os
[21:12] <Arcidias> livingdaylight: so now go down to Storage
[21:12] <izatt82> livingdaylight:  after you have created a new VM go to settings and then click on storage on the right you can select the ISO
[21:12] <Kjeldor> how come itunes doesnt clean out from WINE diretory after uninstall
[21:12] <Arcidias> livingdaylight: Click Storage and add a CD
[21:12] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: because of the way its coded. Some apps work extremely well, some work badly, some won't even install
[21:12] <Arcidias> livingdaylight: and it would give you a selection box, where you can find the iso, then add it, then Start the virtual box
[21:12] <acathla> Sid123, just install libvdpau1
[21:13] <Arcidias> livingdaylight: and that;s it!
[21:13] <Kjeldor> so what shall I do?
[21:13] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: you need to remove some entries in ~/.config
[21:13] <randyrkelly> is there another zip file manager that is very good
[21:13] <Kjeldor> how?
[21:13] <Arcidias> guys, I gotta get going
[21:13] <Arcidias> good night all

[21:14] <Kjeldor> how do I do that?
[21:14] <ActionParsnip> randyrkelly: you can use command line, what are you trying to achieve?

[21:19] <CT1> Hi. Other than '~/.gtk-bookmarks'  Where do the other places that appear in 'Places' come from?  I have an NTFS volume mounted on boot but it appears twice in 'Places'  Where should I start looking for why this happens?  "Unprivileged user can not mount NTFS block devices using the external FUSE library"
[21:19] <Kjeldor> ActionParsnip: What do I do next? I have Places>Home Folder opened
[21:19] <istvan> ActionParsnip, i used the netbook to connect the coputer having questions. I set the netbook to forward the inet connection from wireless to it's ethernet port. and i tried 4 different ports ont he switch, 2 of which i know to be good.
[21:20] <Sid123> <acathla>hey can u help
[21:20] <cesc_> guys I decided to install driver RTL8187 instead of RTL8187L which I installed earlier on.
[21:20] <cesc_> when trying to compile the driver ...... I got this output...  http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/yMWK1F9r
[21:20] <cesc_> I got some errors there.. any help?
[21:20] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: read the previous stuff I said, its all there
[21:21] <ActionParsnip> istvan: fine but if you look at the router, is the connected indicator LED on for the link??
[21:21] <Kjeldor> ActionParsnip: Im inside .nautilus folder now...
[21:22] <istvan> not when the computer having isues is connected. there are a bunch of other computers connected to that switch, and all of them do have the lights, yes.
[21:22] <nlko> hey, if i want to install ubuntu on my laptop with encrypted drive from the start do i need the alternative cd?
[21:22] <istvan> ActionParsnip, so i'm confused esp. cause ifconfig said packets were getting recieved, but the lights on the switch say no connection?
[21:23] <Quantum_Ion> nlko, Are you gonna be erasing everything on the hardrive
[21:23] <nlko> Quantum_Ion: yes
[21:23] <nlko> Quantum_Ion: fresh install
[21:24] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: read what I said. I never mentioned .nautilus, try reading and not guessing
[21:24]  * Bridge| fresh installs his brain......
[21:24] <ratdog> hello, somehow i lost the gnome network manager on the desktop. Where it would go in the panel. It doesn not auto start. Im on Lucid.
[21:24] <ActionParsnip> istvan: does it turn on with the netbook which gets the web when its connected?
[21:24] <istvan> ActionParsnip, havn't tried that. will do now
[21:24] <ActionParsnip> ratdog: press ALT+F2, type: nm-applet   press ENTER
[21:24] <CT1> Where can I read up on how the "Places" menu is populated? "~/.gtk-bookmarks" is only half the story.  How are drives added to the menu automatically?
[21:24] <ActionParsnip> istvan: i asked you 4 times now
[21:24] <nlko> Quantum_Ion: ive gone for http://gb.releases.ubuntu.com/10.04/ubuntu-10.04-alternate-i386.iso, seem ok?
[21:25] <cesc_> I'm desperate. I'm trying to install drivers for my Alfa Network AWUS036H on my machine running xubuntu. This wireless usb adapter has chipset Realtek RTL8187. Early this afternoon I installed RTL8187L driver successfully on kernel but the device is not recognized. I reckon it must be chipset RTL8187 instead (withou the final L). Now I'm trying to install it and I get errors. The output is here
[21:25] <Kjeldor> ActionParsnip: Even if I read your post 100x, I still wouldnt understand it as I am a new user to UBUNTU. It would be of great help if you could lay it down to me in "laymans terms" for the time being while I'm learning
[21:25] <cesc_> http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/yMWK1F9r
[21:26] <ActionParsnip> (21:13:49) ActionParsnip: Kjeldor: check in ~/.config/menus/applications-merged
[21:26] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: you are just lazy
[21:26] <thune3> cesc_: i'm guessing that the "2007" version that you are trying to compile is not compatible with newer kernels, but I'm probably wrong.
[21:26] <istvan> ActionParsnip, and i answered that all of the other comptuers (including this one which is running 10.04) that are connected to that switch have the lights on the switch that corospond to them on. but i figured i'd give up and tell u what the deal with the netbook is too.
[21:26] <Quantum_Ion> nlko What was on the hardrive before Linux ?
[21:26] <Kjeldor> how do i do that "check in"
[21:26] <ratdog> ActionParsnip did not work..
[21:26] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: open the folder
[21:27] <Kjeldor> Im a windows user, and new to UBUNTU sorry
[21:27] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: you arent new to reading though
[21:27] <ratdog> ActionParsnip something popsuo then disapears
[21:27] <Kjeldor> yeah, but how do I execute what your saying
[21:27] <ActionParsnip> istvan: if you run: sudo lshw -C network     what is the product name for the wired connection?
[21:27] <nlko> Quantum_Ion: windows and linux
[21:27] <bsmith093> i bought one of those sata ide to usb kits on ebay, i cant get it to work and honestly it looks very flimsy could it be a fake because the adapter that the sata cables pluginto feells very light
[21:28] <Quantum_Ion> nlko you said the disk was encrypted by what operating system ?
[21:28] <nlko> Quantum_Ion: im pretty sure its not a big deal, was just wondering which iso had the encrypted drive option at install time
[21:28] <nlko> Quantum_Ion: it wasnt, i want it to be now, bu ubuntu
[21:28] <ActionParsnip> Kjeldor: you follow the folder tree until you get to the folder, you will then see the files which are being merged with your apps menu and can clean them up
[21:28] <Quantum_Ion> nlko, take the 32 Desktop Install I would wipe the hard disk clean if you just plan to use Ubuntu Linux on the drive
[21:29] <sarah32> hi i have a small problem could pls someone help me ?

[21:32] <cesc_> I'm desperate. I'm trying to install drivers for my Alfa Network AWUS036H on my machine running xubuntu. This wireless usb adapter has chipset Realtek RTL8187.

[21:32] <Kjeldor> done moved to trash...
[21:32] <daedalus_> Hi people. Yesterday I could zoom in using shift+scroll wheel (after activating the restricted nvidia drivers) today it won't let me. I don't see the option in the nividia program
[21:32] <ActionParsnip> ratdog: install wicd if youo don't use 3G
[21:33] <sarah32> <cesc_> what driver did you install ?
[21:33] <sarah32> <cesc_> did you try to install compat-wireless ?
[21:33] <ratdog> ActionParsnip done that, still no luck :/
[21:33] <Kjeldor> how come when I open wine, I still see alot of itunes applications inside? Is there a way to remove those permanently?
[21:33] <sarah32> <cesc_> and what OS do you use ?
[21:33] <cesc_> a driver for my usb wireless adapter.. Alfa Network model AWUS036H
[21:34] <cesc_> I use xubuntu updated to today.
[21:34] <istvan> ActionParsnip, http://pastebin.com/FKbiiK1q
[21:34] <cesc_> xubuntu 10.04
[21:34] <cesc_> No I did not try to install compat-wireless.
[21:34] <sarah32> <cesc_> what driver did you install ? and if you use lucid i do and i have rtl8187l and rtl8187b i mean i lucid u dont need to install any drivers unless u want use aircrack or something
[21:34] <packagedeliverer> Hi, I have a newbie question, I'm using a command line. Is it possible to link a directory to another? for example doing "cd /folder/subfolder" positions you in "/folder/subfolder2" ?
[21:35] <Jordan_U> cesc_: First thing I would try is "sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-lucid-generic"
[21:35] <sarah32> <sarah32> do you use alfa just for internet or for hacking neigbours too ?
[21:35] <ActionParsnip> istvan: our wireless has an IP
[21:36] <Jordan_U> !tab | sarah32
[21:36] <sarah32> <cesc_>do you use alfa just for internet or for hacking neigbours too ?
[21:36] <ubottu> sarah32: You can use your <tab> key for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[21:36] <cesc_> sarah32 this usb wireless adapter.. I use it on another machine with ubuntu 10.04 with no problems at all. It worked straight away without installing any drivers.. On this other machine with xubuntu 10.04 it doesn't work.
[21:36] <sarah32> sorry jordan
[21:36] <ZykoticK9> packagedeliverer, check out the ln command, you need to use -s for directories
[21:36] <Jordan_U> sarah32: No reason to be sorry :)
[21:36] <istvan> ActionParsnip, yes, it's online with wireless just fine. but i'm looking to use the ethernet. and as far as i can tell those settings are separate? they are int he gui network connections anyway...
[21:36] <nUboon2Age> cesc_: i see on the web where others have used ndiswrapper successfully with the RTL8187.
[21:36] <killerforeverr> http://icecream-co.webnode.com/chatbox/ all go ur gonna be gms and pms now now now
[21:36] <killerforeverr> http://icecream-co.webnode.com/chatbox/ all go ur gonna be gms and pms now now now
[21:36] <killerforeverr> http://icecream-co.webnode.com/chatbox/ all go ur gonna be gms and pms now now now
[21:36] <FloodBot3> killerforeverr: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[21:36] <nUboon2Age> cesc_: so that is always an option.
[21:36] <packagedeliverer> Hey ZykoticK9, ln produces "Operation not permitted" I'm a logged in as root
[21:37] <sarah32> <cesc_>  check up dmesg
[21:37] <ActionParsnip> istvan: you can use network manager in the indicator applet
[21:37] <packagedeliverer> A google search told me symbolic links were not possible for fat32 nor ntfs?
[21:37] <Jordan_U> cesc_: If it works out of the box with 10.04 on another machine then you probably shouln't be compiling and installing non-standard drivers.
[21:37] <ZykoticK9> packagedeliverer, the syntax would be like "ln -s /source/directory /source/directory2" - you'd need to use sudo if not in home directory
[21:38] <daedalus_> Next question, does ubuntu come with something to play rss/xml podcasts?
[21:38] <istvan> ActionParsnip, yes, thats what i'm using, and i think i have everything set rite. if not, i'v changed it around pleanty of times
[21:38] <ZykoticK9> packagedeliverer, i'd recommend against using "root" account in ubuntu
=== daedalus_ is now known as helpmelinux
=== helpmelinux is now known as helpmeeee
[21:39] <Jordan_U> cesc_: Xubuntu uses exactly the same kernel an drivers as Ubuntu, so it's probably not actually a problem with the wireless drivers. Possibly a problem with USB in general (can you use other USB devices?) or a simple configuration problem.
[21:39] <cesc_> sarah32 I have my own internet connection but I have experimented hacking some neigbours just to see that this works.
[21:39] <ActionParsnip> helpmeeee: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/tunesviewer-itunes-university-media-and-podcasts-in-linux.html
[21:39] <nUboon2Age> cesc_: i wonder if differences in xubuntu and ubuntu's network manager could explain the difference.  There is a #xubuntu channel that might be helpful too.
[21:39] <sarah32> <cesc_> i know your ip
[21:39] <cesc_> :)
[21:40] <sarah32> will report you to your neighbours
[21:40] <packagedeliverer> ZykoticK9, I'm using telnet with sh, not bash, I'll need to figure out how to get sudo working
[21:40] <ZykoticK9> packagedeliverer, if you really are "root" you don't need sudo
[21:40] <sarah32> <cesc_> try to install if you know how compat-wireless with those drivers your internet will work and aircrack too i mean if you want
[21:41] <ZykoticK9> packagedeliverer, telnet = fail, check out SSH for secure connections
[21:41] <sarah32> and check up aircrack website there is a very lot of info about alfa
[21:41] <cesc_> the bizarre thing is why my Alfa Network works out of the box on my PC with ubuntu lucid lynx and not on my other pc with xubuntu 10.04.
[21:41] <ActionParsnip> sarah32: i know yours too
[21:41] <sarah32> <cesc_> cuz there maybe is driver missing
[21:41] <sarah32> <ActionParsnip> no you know my proxy
[21:42] <ratdog> ActionParsnip can i purge wirc with terminal then re-install
[21:42] <ActionParsnip> sure
[21:42] <packagedeliverer> ZykoticK9, it's an emtec NAS, it can't handle SSH, hence telnet
[21:42] <ActionParsnip> sarah32: what's my ip ;)
[21:42] <Jordan_U> packagedeliverer: That is correct, you cannot create symlinks on fat32 (not sure about ntfs) and you also cannot create hard links to directories on almost all filesystems.
[21:42] <cesc_> let's see compat-wireless in ubuntu software center
[21:42] <sarah32> <cesc_> type dmesg and you will see if oyur card is working or there is a driver missing
[21:42] <ratdog> ActionParsnip can i have help with the command?
[21:42] <nUboon2Age> cesc_: that's why i say it could be about differences between ubuntu and xubuntu.
[21:42] <cesc_> ok let me see.
[21:42] <istvan> ActionParsnip, did i miss waht you were saying with the connection tools? i stillc an't get a ethernet connection...
[21:42] <sarah32> <ActionParsnip> 911?
[21:42] <packagedeliverer> Jordan_U, I also tried ntfs, it didn't work
[21:42] <ActionParsnip> ratdog: sudo apt-get --purge remove wicd   will remove it fully
[21:43] <ratdog> ty, /me hands ActionParsnip a DEW
[21:43] <ActionParsnip> sarah32: i'm an ubuntu member, we get cloaks
[21:43] <winterweaver> I need to install some packages, but it fails because I previously installed docky, and now have the ricotz ppa packages conflicting with the default packages. See error here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1553537
[21:43] <sarah32> <ActionParsnip> im a Windows 7 member
[21:43] <sarah32> so what
[21:43] <sarah32> ?
[21:43] <sarah32> im better
[21:44] <FloodBot3> sarah32: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[21:44] <ActionParsnip> sarah32: yes, but you dont get irc cloaks to completely mask your ip
[21:44] <sarah32> :)
[21:44] <rww> anyone can get an irc cloak to mask their isp. huzzah unaffiliated/ cloaks
[21:44] <slidinghorn> trying to use conkyforecast and need help getting an image to show for current conditions.  was recommended to use a template, but after seeing an example, it's over my head -- looking for someone "taller" than myself ;-)
[21:44] <sarah32> <ActionParsnip> i dont know much about cloaks etc
[21:45] <sarah32> :)
[21:45] <owd95> someone that can recommend me a good nvidia card, i have a ati 5770 now?
[21:46] <mena> hi
[21:46] <Daekdroom> owd95, You shouldn't be thinking of getting a new videocard if you have a 5770
[21:46] <mena> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[21:46] <headkase314> owd95, if you're Ubuntu only a 5770 should be adequate for pretty-well any task?
[21:46] <ActionParsnip> Daekdroom: depends on requirements
[21:47] <ActionParsnip> owd95: whats the system for?
[21:47] <Daekdroom> ActionParsnip, I can't think of anyone using Ubuntu and envying more than the power of a 5770 unless he's going to use it for something other than 3D power.
[21:47] <ActionParsnip> Daekdroom: we'll see
[21:47] <headkase314> owd95, I say that because there aren't that many cutting-edge high-requirement games for Ubuntu.  Now if you're dual-booting with Windows and want games there then that's different...
[21:48] <ratdog> k, ActionParsnip how can i purge gnome network manager?
[21:49] <owd95> i heard that nvidia cards works better in linux then ati... and games not working great in wine...
[21:49] <ratdog> hehhe
[21:49] <owd95> and compiz not works smooth with my ati card...
[21:49] <ActionParsnip> ratdog: sudo apt-get --purge remove network-manager
[21:50] <thewanderer1> how can I install Ubuntu on a pendrive? how much space do I need?
[21:50] <ratdog> ActionParsnip took a break
[21:50] <ratdog> o ty
[21:50] <headkase314> owd95, my Radeon HD 4670 works like a champ in Ubuntu (I'm Ubuntu only) but I don't use it in WINE.  What processor do you have?  I think that may make more difference for you?
[21:50] <ActionParsnip> owd95: nvidia always work fantastically in Linux
[21:50] <owd95> headkase314: i have an intel core i5 750
[21:50] <ActionParsnip> owd95: nvidia have been supporting Linux for at least 10 years that I'm aware of, and probably earlier
[21:50] <headkase314> owd95, do you know the frequency? (Ghz)
[21:51] <owd95> headkase314: yes, 2.6GHz i think with turbo
[21:52] <owd95> ActionParsnip: nice, can you recommend me a good card then?
[21:52] <headkase314> owd95, I can't see your processor being a bottleneck then.  However a 5770 is a decent card too.  So, it makes me wonder if WINE itself is what is deficient here..  Opinions anyone?
[21:52] <ActionParsnip> owd95: nvidia but not the very very latest ones and you'll be fine
[21:52] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, do you want a LiveCD type environment on the USB key or a real install onto a USB key?
[21:53] <thewanderer1> ZykoticK9: an install - and yes, I'm aware of flash wear or w/e, I will handle that stuff
[21:53] <zipper> Hi everbody
[21:53] <owd95> headkase314: so you think i can keep my card?
[21:53] <thewanderer1> only I don't have an optical drive...
[21:53] <zipper> i got a problem burning dvd0s with brasero
[21:53] <headkase314> owd95, one second googling
[21:53] <DasEi> !unetbootin | thewanderer1
[21:53] <ubottu> thewanderer1: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[21:54] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, do a regular install and select it as the install drive - BUT you need to click "advanced" and select to install GRUB onto the USB key if you want to select it to boot from BIOS (understand that part?  might not be clear)
[21:54] <zipper> i cant burn any dvd
[21:54] <DasEi>  thewanderer1: unetbootin is very confortable to me
[21:55] <thewanderer1> ZykoticK9: yes, well, I can manage GRUB, I only needed to know if this is possible in a straightforward way
[21:55] <thewanderer1> will the persistent install produce an overlay so it keeps all files (aufs or so)?
[21:55] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, if you want a LiveCD type then use unetbootin or startup disk creator as suggseted by others
[21:55] <owd95> ActionParsnip: thx
[21:55] <owd95> !
[21:55] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, both ways are "pretty" straight forward actually
[21:55] <thewanderer1> ZykoticK9: not really, I want a persistent install so that I can store files, packages, and tweak settings
[21:56] <headkase314> owd95, I'm not all that familiar with WINE but would WINETricks -> http://wiki.winehq.org/winetricks help make programs run better / easier to run?  There is a link to Ubuntu .deb files on that page that includes the latest WINETricks
=== anthony_ is now known as arthurrilke
[21:56] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, if you want persistent then i'd recommend using the Ubuntu Startup Disk creator over unetbootin
[21:56] <headkase314> owd95, Includes the latest WINE tricks as part of the latest WINE for Ubuntu
[21:56] <owd95> headkase314: thx! i will try that!
[21:56] <bsmith093> is there a way to batch streamdump about 15 .ram files
[21:56] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, persitent != install
[21:56] <headkase314> owd95, no promises but I hope it helps
[21:57] <headkase314> owd95, as always read a lot, type a little ;)
[21:57] <bsmith093> i know i could do it one at a time manually but that would take forever so id much rather have some software do it for me ( just feed it the rams
[21:57] <thewanderer1> ZykoticK9: I thought it would give me an overlay so that all my files and settings are kept, like an aufs branch mounted over my root filesystem that uses some writable directory as the backing store
[21:57] <thewanderer1> I'm unclear on this now - what does persistent mean here?
[21:58] <thewanderer1> I'd like it to behave exactly like a disk install
[21:58] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, some of the USB key is used to store files/data
[21:58] <thewanderer1> ah-ha, so no persistency in Ubuntu...
[21:58] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, you can perform a regular install onto the USB - just do the Grub manual thing
[21:58] <thune3> thewanderer1: if doing full install to USB, be aware of  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/549756 it was only recently fixed and could affect you if installing with lucid.
[21:59] <thewanderer1> thune3: thanks, it looks scary
[21:59] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, that's want i'm talking about grub
[21:59] <opij> The LXDE desktop environment doesnt seem to save me any resources, yet, Lubuntu barely takes up 60 MB of ram. I'm not looking for non-ubuntu support here, just would like to know what I'm doing wrong.
[21:59] <thewanderer1> I don't like rescuing my system as I don't have an optical drive :P
[21:59] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, just click on "advanced" and manually point grub to the usb during install!
[21:59] <thewanderer1> okay
[22:00] <thewanderer1> so where do I boot the installer from?
[22:00] <thewanderer1> from the same pendrive that I install to?
[22:00] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, you'd need 2 USB drives
[22:00] <thewanderer1> uh
[22:00] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, did you say you have no optical drive?
[22:01] <thewanderer1> yes, I did
[22:01] <thewanderer1> not even one at this house :P
[22:01] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, then you'd need 2 usb drives to do anything.  good luck man :)
[22:02] <Chiggins> Could someone help me get VNC up and running? I can't seem to connect to anything
[22:02] <thewanderer1> well, I can actually set that up with debootstrap...
[22:02] <thewanderer1> if I know what packages I need to get it going
[22:02] <headkase314> It amazes me that hardware is shifting so that sometimes you just don't have an optical drive.  I remember before optical drives and its looking like I'll see the end of optical drives too! ;)
[22:03] <opij> The LXDE desktop environment doesnt seem to save me any resources, yet, Lubuntu barely takes up 60 MB of ram. I'm not looking for non-ubuntu support here, just would like to know what I'm doing wrong.
=== Ginbun2__ is now known as ginbuntu
[22:03] <thewanderer1> opij: LXDE is supposed to take 60-80MB RAM...
[22:04] <sarah32> cesc, are you still here?
[22:04] <Messy> i dont now why ubuntu doesnt come with an irc client
[22:04] <opij> thewanderer1, it's taking over 500
[22:04] <maco> Messy: it does... empathy... but its awful
[22:04] <slidinghorn> Messy:  it comes w/ xchat
[22:04] <slidinghorn> doesnt it?
[22:05] <Messy> No it doesnt
[22:05] <maco> slidinghorn: no, xubuntu does though, i think
[22:05] <craigbass1976> I've a friend on gutsy.  Though he's on broadband, connection is still too slow to upgrade to hardy, then to lucid.  Well, not if I don't want to be here all week.  How do I get thunderbird running once I get a clean lucid running, somehow using the tbird profile from gutsy
[22:05] <headkase314> slidinghorn, I had to install XChat
[22:05] <maco> kubuntu has quassel
[22:05] <Quantum_Ion> xchat has been he standard for a longtime
[22:05] <slidinghorn> i guess i just forgot installing it, lol
[22:05] <Messy> empathy doesnt have irc support and i installed xchat manually
[22:05] <maco> craigbass1976: just keep the dot files in ~
[22:05] <thewanderer1> Pidgin supports IRC :P
[22:05] <maco> craigbass1976: .mozilla and maybe .mozilla-thunderbird
[22:05] <Messy> yea but its not on default install
[22:05] <maco> craigbass1976: but you know, you can install clean and just not delete /home...
[22:05] <panoptical> mint comes with xchat
[22:05] <headkase314> Pidgin supports IRC?  I'll have to play with that when I get home!
[22:06] <maco> Messy: empathy does have ir suppot
[22:06] <panoptical> pidgin's irc support sucks
[22:06] <maco> Messy: its *bad*support, but its there
[22:06] <ZykoticK9> Messy, i agree with you re IRC - but it's offtopic
[22:06] <headkase314> Heheh, ok bad support ;)
[22:06] <ZykoticK9> maco, i wouldn't make the claim that empathy supports IRC - serious issues there...
[22:06] <Messy> I dont know what the topic is because i started xchat and it logged me in here automaticly
[22:06] <maco> Messy: bad enough that the initial setup wizard doesnt offer it. but if you go to create a new account through the menus, its there
[22:06] <maco> ZykoticK9: i *said* it was *bad*
[22:07] <maco> Messy:  its at the top of the window
[22:07] <sarah32> guys will ubuntu lucid work on my desktop pc ?
[22:07] <Messy> maco : I searched through the available new accounts and irc was not there
[22:07] <maco> sarah32: try with a live cd and find out
[22:07] <headkase314> sarah32, boot the live cd and try
[22:07] <maco> Messy: the initial thing on the wizard doesnt offer it
[22:07] <sarah32> i i have commodore
[22:07] <maco> Messy: but ive seen it in use
[22:07] <sarah32> and the other is atari
[22:07] <ZykoticK9> Messy, there is a "bug" that you need to add another type of account - prior to being able to successfully add an IRC account (with empathy)
[22:07] <thewanderer1> sarah32: it's not a "desktop PC" :P
[22:08] <headkase314> sarah32, there are two options when you boot from the cd: install and live cd desktop.  Go to the desktop and see if everything works.
[22:08] <batbrat> Hi
[22:08] <Messy> I see..
[22:08] <maco> ZykoticK9: i dont think thats a bug...im pretty sure its "this protocol is so crap, we need to hide it"
[22:08] <sarah32> my dad told me it is
[22:08] <batbrat> I'm trying to figure out an installation issue.
[22:08] <maco> sarah32: commodore is about 15 years too old
[22:08] <slidinghorn> running conkyforecast on Lucid.  Trying to use the images in /usr/share/conkyforecast/images/weathericons but they're not showing up.  My .conkyrc here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/478531/   and here's a screenshot: http://imagebin.org/109833
[22:08] <thewanderer1> sarah32: "PC" is a name used to refer to IBM-compatible personal computers. Commodore is not IBM-compatible. alright?
[22:08] <Quantum_Ion> I wish Ubuntu Linux recognized all wifi cards during the live cd tryout
[22:08] <headkase314> Don't make me pull out my Amiga and start bashing people with it! ;)
[22:08] <mneptok> maco: uhhh ... try 25
[22:08] <maco> thewanderer1: PC means Personal Computer, regardless of architecture
[22:08] <ZykoticK9> maco, it's an Empathy upstream bug - and they say they "won't fix" because it's too much work to fix IRC on Empathy and they recommend using an alternative :|
[22:08] <duffydack> linux on amiga is possible...:)
[22:09] <Quantum_Ion> Amiga is a collectors item
[22:09] <batbrat> I'm trying to install freeglut3 without libgl1-mesa-dev. I tried to compile it from source since the package manager could not help me.
[22:09] <maco> sarah32: you need a computer made in the last decade
[22:09] <Quantum_Ion> I wish I had kept my IBM PCjr
[22:09] <cesc> sarah32 yes I'm still here
[22:09] <sarah32> thewanderer1,  so what commodore is ? it isnt a tractor for sure
[22:09] <thewanderer1> maco: in the last 15 years :P
[22:09] <maco> sarah32: its a early-1980s computer
[22:09] <batbrat> When compiling from source, freeglut is unable to find the gl headers
[22:09] <headkase314> cesc, hows the wireless going?
[22:09] <Quantum_Ion> it used 5 1.4 floppy drive remember those
[22:09] <maco> sarah32: it doesnt meet the minimum specs required for ubuntu
[22:09] <batbrat> I located them at /usr/include/ATI/GL
[22:09] <cesc> trying to download the correct compat-wireless from ubuntu software center
[22:09] <thewanderer1> sarah32: sorry, Ubuntu doesn't provide a system architecture for Commodore/Atari
[22:09] <Slart> batbrat: have you installed the opengl headers for development?
[22:09] <maco> sarah32: you need an intel-compatible cpu and at least 256MB of RAM.. so.. around 1998 or newer
[22:10] <thewanderer1> sarah32: Ubuntu only works on i386 and amd64-compatible PC's
[22:10] <sarah32> cesc u can add backtrack repistory to your ubuntu and there u will have drivers for rtl8187 pathced for injecton so you wont need to compile or anything
[22:10] <batbrat> If you mean fglrx-dev,then yes Slart
[22:10] <mneptok> thewanderer1: and PPC
[22:10] <Quantum_Ion> sara32, I hope you have a modern laptop with 4GB of RAM MEMORY TOO
[22:10] <headkase314> thewanderer1, ppc too?  What is ps3 architecture?
[22:10] <sarah32> maco ok tnx
[22:10] <sarah32> :)
[22:10] <thewanderer1> hm, I wasn't aware for Ubuntu for PPC
[22:10] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, sarah32 actually i doubt ubuntu would run on a true 386 these days
[22:10] <thewanderer1> s/for/of/
[22:10] <cesc> which is the backtrack repository?
[22:10] <maco> thewanderer1: its a community supported port
[22:10] <thewanderer1> ZykoticK9: alright, i387 :P
[22:11] <maco> !backtrack | cesc
[22:11] <ubottu> cesc: There are some Ubuntu derivatives that we cannot provide support for due to repository and software changes. Please consult their websites for more information. Examples: gNewSense (support in #gnewsense), Linux Mint (see !mintsupport), LinuxMCE (support in #linuxmce), CrunchBang (support in #crunchbang), BackTrack (support in #backtrack-linux)
[22:11] <headkase314> cesc, you mean backport?
[22:11] <Quantum_Ion> When XP is no longer supported by Micro I will just through Ubuntu Linux on it
[22:11] <batbrat> Slart: Do you know what needs to be done to get things working?
[22:11] <maco> ZykoticK9: 686 is minimum i think now
[22:11] <ZykoticK9> maco, i believe so as well ;)
[22:11] <sarah32> commodore was a calculator not a computer and i used it in 80's
[22:11] <sarah32> :)
[22:11] <maco> headkase314: no, cesc wants to use bt4's repos
[22:11] <thewanderer1> I haven't heard of packages being compiled for i686
[22:11] <cesc> no sarah32 suggested backtrack repository
[22:11] <Slart> batbrat: hmm.. nope.. but let me google around for a bit.. see if I can't find something useful
[22:11] <Oer> Quantum_Ion, good thought.
[22:11] <maco> thewanderer1: its been 486 for ages, but support for 486 is being dropped in 10.10
[22:12] <headkase314> maco, oh ok - was wondering if he was trying to get a backport of some wireless modules from +1
[22:12] <thewanderer1> maco: oh uh.
[22:12] <batbrat> Slart: Thanks. I hope you find something useful.
[22:12] <Quantum_Ion> sarah32, you can always take out the hardrive of old computers and go purchase a hardrive enclosure and use the old hard drive as a backup hardrive
[22:12] <thewanderer1> hm, I can see some interesting stuff in UNetBootin
[22:12] <maco> thewanderer1:  packages *say* 386, but they're not ;-)
[22:12] <ZykoticK9> thewanderer1, in Ubuntu the i386 is really i686
[22:12] <thewanderer1> ah, alright
[22:12] <thewanderer1> Developers, developers, developers.... :P
[22:12] <maco> afaik, they say 386 for legacy reasons.... ie, so upgrades dont freak out
[22:13] <Quantum_Ion> sarah32, every 4 -5 years you need to purchase a new computer
[22:13] <headkase314> thewanderer1, 10.10 I believe is going to be i686+ only, dropping i586?  Anyone confirm that?
[22:13] <thewanderer1> headkase314: I don't know, haven't been to Ubuntu for like 2 years
[22:13] <maco> Quantum_Ion: disagree
[22:13] <maco> Quantum_Ion: 10 years
[22:13] <maco> Quantum_Ion: well... for desktops
[22:13] <sarah32> Quantum_Ion, i bought last year msigt725
[22:13] <sarah32> msigt725
[22:14] <maco> Quantum_Ion: because they can be upgraded nicely :)  but laptops...ok sure 5....
[22:14] <Slart> batbrat: you've downloaded the source for freeglut somewhere?
[22:14] <sarah32> i think it will last few years
[22:14] <thewanderer1> if I select "10.04 Hd_media" in Unetbootin instead of "10.04 Live", will it install Ubuntu on my pendrive just like it is installed on a hard disk?
[22:14] <headkase314> Confirmed: http://www.thisweekinlinux.com/2010/06/ubuntu-10-10-maverick-meerkat-drops-pre-i686-cpu-support-does-it-affect-you/
[22:15] <RickBuzzly_> You're one of my kind sarah32. Love the 8-bits.
[22:15] <sarah32> RickBuzzly_,  me too
[22:15] <sarah32> heheheh
[22:15] <aeon-ltd> headkase314: about time, kinda. if you have a i686 cpu, the difference is/was huge
[22:15] <RickBuzzly_> 6502 forever
[22:15] <thewanderer1> phew, my Pentium Pro is safe!
[22:15] <headkase314> aeon-ltd,  So no Atom processors for 10.10 as I'm certain those are i586?
[22:15] <thewanderer1> headkase314: what?!
[22:16] <ZykoticK9> headkase314, no they're not..
[22:16] <maco> headkase314: no.. im using an Atom right now with 10.10
[22:16] <aeon-ltd> headkase314: unr might still retain support
[22:16]  * maco is using normal kubuntu...
[22:16] <thewanderer1> Atom is amd64, guys...
[22:16] <aeon-ltd> headkase314: its not hard for canonical to supply 2 different kernels
[22:16] <RickBuzzly_> 68000 also :)
[22:16] <thewanderer1> unless you have some really ancient Atom stuff
[22:16] <headkase314> maco, ok I thought Atom was 586 I am absolutely willing to admit I'm wrong with that! ;)
[22:16] <maco> thewanderer1: only some. some are 32bit
[22:16] <Slart> !ot
[22:16] <ubottu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[22:17] <thewanderer1> ok...
[22:17] <Quantum_Ion> Atom is Intel
[22:17] <Quantum_Ion> Atom is that processor in netbooks
[22:17] <Zol> how come I have around 75 processes of console-kit-daemon --no-daemon  running?
[22:17] <maco> Quantum_Ion: yes....and...? that doesnt prevent being amd64
[22:17] <Zol> I kill them but they return. :(
[22:18] <ZykoticK9> Zol, i only have 1
[22:18] <Quantum_Ion> AMD64 is made by AMD
[22:18] <thewanderer1> Quantum_Ion: no
[22:18] <maco> Quantum_Ion: amd64 is an architecture
[22:18] <Quantum_Ion> ATOM is made by Intel
[22:18] <k23> Zol, they are threads i guess
[22:18] <maco> Quantum_Ion: intel licenses it from amd
[22:18] <Quantum_Ion> maco, wtf
[22:18] <thewanderer1> Quantum_Ion: if you wanna talk about that, feel free to join #debian-offtopic
[22:18] <thewanderer1> it's a good place to chat, really
[22:18] <maco> Quantum_Ion: intel's own 64bit architecute (itanium) is not backwards compatible with ia32, so 32bit OSes cant run on it, which means it never even got out the gate
[22:18] <Quantum_Ion> maco, thanks for the info

[22:20] <SqRt7744> does anyone know how to go about finding the cause of a hard lockup when I try to suspend? I'm thinking along the lines of remote debugging, but maybe there is a simpler way...
[22:20] <Slart> batbrat: I haven't really found anything.. as far as I can tell the opengl development headers should come from the ATI package
[22:20] <batbrat> Slart: They do come with the ATI package
[22:21] <batbrat> They get installed in /usr/include/ATI/GL/
[22:21] <Slart> batbrat: and I can't really see a reason for them not being used by the sources for glut
[22:21] <batbrat> Well
