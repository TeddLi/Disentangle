[00:43] <bugtraq> hi
[00:43] <daftykins> we need info from the router, so without that we're done here, bbra

[00:45] <bazhang> rogger_h, hint about what
[00:45] <rogger_h> Hey guys i need some help , im having a webserver Nginx and from some reason all the domain urls other then the base domain giving me 404, ideas?
[00:45] <rogger_h> repaste
[00:45] <daftykins> rogger_h: either the sites aren't enabled or you've configured them incorrectly.
[00:46] <daftykins> read the logs to find out what's wrong.
[00:46] <bazhang> #nginx rogger_h
[00:46] <rogger_h> yes but i dont know what i did wrong
[00:46] <bbra> I dont have access to the router right now so i need to rely on the information in my memory. My house is 20 minutes away from the laptops owner.
[00:46] <roky> thanks
[00:46] <daftykins> bbra: then we can't help
[00:46] <rogger_h> on #nginx is even WORSE, the thing is same configs working on another server
[00:46] <rogger_h> so im not that sure its nginx misconfiguration
[00:46] <bazhang> bbra, perhaps the issue is that the router was set to hide the access point
[00:46] <bbra> I need help on what to do and then a get back there and do it.
[00:47] <daftykins> bbra: we can't help with something that's not in front of you really; as we've said we need more info from the real situation to advise
[00:47] <bbra> No it was not, checked anything.
[00:47] <daftykins> i don't understand that sentence
[00:47] <bbra> Tell me how you would handle it then.
[00:47] <bazhang> bbra, how can you possibly check from such a great distance
[00:48] <bbra> I got home after gaving up there, simple.
[00:48] <daftykins> you can't scan for a wireless network 20 mins away...
[00:48] <bazhang> being able to hands on with the network is key here bbra
[00:49] <daftykins> bbra: do you own your own laptop, or a smartphone perhaps that can have a program installed to check networks and what channels they're on?
[00:49] <bazhang> 20 minutes away is much further than hands on
[00:49] <zuippo> bbra: if the laptop can connect to other networks (try one at your home) then it's either hidden SSID or the channel doesn't work so you have to change it in the router. You can't do anything right now
[00:50] <OerHeks> bbra, when your SSID does not show up, disable wlan, go into keys & passwords, remove the wlan key entry, and enablewlan again, etc
[00:50]  * OerHeks seen that before
[00:50] <daftykins> ah har
[00:50] <bbra> Okey in other words: The laptop worked for months without problems, now the ssid it used to connect to is gone. The hardware is checked, other oses work as they should, the 60 old owner never touched a thing so the settings are 100% certain okay. what would be your steps to research it?
[00:51] <daftykins> we already told you
[00:51] <daftykins> you seem to be ignoring all input
[00:51] <bazhang> if it's someone else's there's no way to access anything
[00:51] <OerHeks> probably in many channels ..
[00:51] <mil1i> Hello
[00:51] <bazhang> you need a direct wire to access it
[00:51] <zuippo> bbra: did you try to connect to a different network with the laptop?
[00:53] <bbra> OerHeks where is this keys and password thing?
[00:53] <bbra> I purged settings already, but i might misset one.
[00:53] <OerHeks> on Unity > systemsettings
[00:54] <daftykins> you know, my own network is often hidden beneath the networks list under "more networks" also
[00:54] <bbra> This one used to be autoconnet, so it wont be so far.
[00:55] <bbra> Its xfce OerHeks
[00:55] <bazhang> bbra, get in range and test again, withe the multiple advice already given
[00:56] <OerHeks> i don't know the xfce menu, keys & passwords is universal, search for it.
[00:56] <bbra> Your advice was to find out the channel right? Tell me why is that important, it never changed at all.
[00:56] <mil1i> Getting a PCIe wifi card to work with Ubuntu was ridiculous! Lol
[00:56] <bazhang> bbra, you said you are at a great distance now
[00:56] <daftykins> mil1i: that's not a rule, maybe just the model you got is badly supported
[00:57] <bazhang> bbra, how can you test anything at this range
[00:57] <daftykins> bbra: you don't know that, a lot of routers are on 'automatic' channel selection and thus would hop when powered off / rebooted
[00:57] <mil1i> Maybe that was it. It was an Asus PCIe card
[00:57] <bbra> Are you talking about the gnome keyring OerHeks?
[00:57] <daftykins> it'd make more sense to accept that in computing topics, you assume nothing and *check*, *check*, then *check again*
[00:59] <bbra> Well it works when booting an other partition, it MUST be the laptops settings then. So i dont get why you want me to check the router.
[00:59] <daftykins> right because another OS may not be tied to the same regulatory domain for channel selection
[00:59] <daftykins> look, instead of fighting free advice... write it down and go try again
[01:00] <bazhang> get in range first
[01:00] <bbra> Dude its Deep night here.
[01:00] <bbra> I cant wake her up to fix her computer.
[01:01] <Netes> Good Evening everybody
[01:02] <bazhang> bbra, you cannot fix it from this distance, what you are asking is simply not possible under present conditions
[01:02] <pheonix99work> bbra, there isn't anything you or any of us can do without you being in front of the computer
[01:03] <bbra> I ask for steps to fix it, not for the actual fix.
[01:03] <bbra> Because i am simply lost.
[01:03] <bazhang> bbra, we have given those many times now
[01:03] <bazhang> bbra, all of them require a proximate fixable distance
[01:03] <bbra> No you have given one, that is to check the wlan channel, and this cant be the proble,.
[01:04] <OerHeks> the user sleeps, you are lost, we have answered.
[01:04] <pheonix99work> bbra, if you're in a country that has channels 12-14 enabled on the router, but the driver isn't working for those channels, changing channesl to 1-11 may be your answer.  As said above, if the router is set to auto channel, it could have changed to channels 12-14
[01:04] <zuippo> bbra: why not?
[01:05] <bbra> Because i only need to ram in a live cd and it works, so i need to find out where the difference between the live cd and the install is.
[01:07] <pheonix99work> You said another OS earlier, you never specified it was a live cd.  I personally assumed it was Windows.
[01:07] <pheonix99work> Also, it was suggested earlier to clear the keys or something related to that.  Those won't be stored on your live CD
[01:08] <pheonix99work> You can also look through /var/log/messages, dmesg, and all the other logs on the system to see if something is throwing an error.
[01:08] <bbra> Yea, indeed keys are my gues, i know that is a frequent nm-applet bug. But i already removed all settings i could think of.
[01:11] <bbra> I never heard of an error message that signals that a specific ssid is not found,  that makes absolute no sense to me.
[01:12] <pheonix99work> You asked for suggestions, I'm just throwing them out.  I have no idea what model wireless nic you have, and I'm not going to go researching it for you.
[01:12] <pheonix99work> If you're not happy with free support, I suggest looking elsewhere.
[01:12] <bbra> I cant check anyway.

[01:15] <pheonix99work> that's why channels have been suggested.
[01:15] <pheonix99work> and another:  http://askubuntu.com/questions/236091/cant-see-wifi-ssid
[01:16] <pheonix99work> from that last link: "I recently had this problem and solved it changing the CHANNEL of my wifi router to 10, Looks like there were too many ssid's in my previous channel..."
[01:18] <bbra> So the problem could be that the driver only allows one channel, the router switched now to the unsupported.
[01:18] <bbra> Then the live disk may use i different driver version....
[01:19] <pheonix99work> This is very possible due to software updates.
[01:19] <bbra> Aha!
[01:20] <daftykins> no driver uses one channel only :)

[01:21] <pheonix99work> My buddy has to change from the propritary driver for his wireless nic to the open source one every other driver update because of issues like this.
[01:21] <pheonix99work> One updates, breaks the card
[01:21] <pheonix99work> swaps to the other one, it works
[01:21] <goopen> Hi folks, could someone check if this config looks sane? https://dpaste.de/ApSw its from /etc/network/interfaces
[01:22] <bbra> Now again, where do i check the channel of a network on the laptop? Because i can walk by with my own and check what this is sending on.
[01:23] <daftykins> i asked if you had a laptop or smartphone to install an app on
[01:23] <daftykins> 'kismet' would be handy
[01:23] <daftykins> !info kismet

[01:25] <bbra> I have an arm based micro pc at hand. It has the usual wlan tools, doubt i can install anything new as the os is aengstroem based.
[01:26] <bbra> Or in short, its not some right click in nm-applet, no?
[01:28] <daftykins> bbra: no.
[01:33] <bbra> Well well i hope i find my way around tomorrow then, Either by upgrading the cards driver or switching the channel.

[03:23] <lotuspsychje> Extreminador: how did you do this upgrade?
[03:23] <Extreminador> restarting the linux atm
[03:24] <Extreminador> http://askubuntu.com/questions/588019/how-to-upgrade-from-14-10-to-15-04
[03:24] <Extreminador> ther it say 14-10
[03:24] <Extreminador> mybe that why with errors lool
[03:24] <Extreminador> but i follow that
[03:24] <lotuspsychje> Extreminador: so wich version do you really have now?
[03:24] <Extreminador> linux still estarting
[03:25] <lotuspsychje> Extreminador: its not reccomended to upgrade LTS to non-LTS
[03:25] <Extreminador> hum lool ups
[03:26] <lotuspsychje> Extreminador: clean install mate
[03:26] <Extreminador> what the lts means ?
[03:26] <mentoc> long term support
[03:26] <lotuspsychje> !lts | Extreminador
[03:26] <ubottu> Extreminador: LTS means Long Term Support. Until 12.04 LTS versions of Ubuntu were supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; since 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) LTS versions will be supported for 5 years on the desktop and server. The latest LTS version of Ubuntu is !Trusty (Trusty Tahr 14.04)
[03:26] <lotuspsychje> Extreminador: why did you leave 14.04 exactly?
[03:27] <Extreminador> was traying to install the mysecureshell
[03:27] <Extreminador> for ftp... but it seems it could not find the repository
[03:27] <Extreminador> and people told me the version 15 bring that alrady
[03:28] <lotuspsychje> Extreminador: ok clean install 15.04 or 15.10 as you need
[03:28] <Extreminador> lol indeed
[03:28] <Extreminador> it's not working lool
[03:29] <Extreminador> AcPI probe fail
[03:29] <Extreminador> people said to turn that off indeed the drivers update
[03:30] <Extreminador> will get them the 15
[03:30] <lotuspsychje> Extreminador: start over clean
[03:30] <Extreminador> yehh i will
[03:31] <Extreminador> what the diference beetween the server version and the one i had ?
[03:32] <Extreminador> does the server version bring's apache, php, ftp , etc ?
[03:32] <daftykins> you don't need FTP on a Linux host :)
[03:32] <daftykins> no every version has all of those
[03:34] <lotuspsychje> Extreminador: ask yourself what you gonna start doing with ubuntu
[03:35] <Extreminador> the ideia was to make only a self server to make some codes
[03:35] <Extreminador> php, java, etc
[03:35] <lotuspsychje> Extreminador: server has no GUI right
[03:35] <Extreminador> ohh them better not
[03:35] <Extreminador> lool
[03:35] <Extreminador> desktop them i guess it's better... i guess the gui part in begyining for me it's handy
[03:36] <lotuspsychje> Extreminador: better choose ubuntu desktop and make it a dev box :p
[03:36] <Extreminador> yehh
[03:37] <Extreminador> guess them i need to search for other tuturial to know how to use the ftp right ?

[04:14] <mib_mib> SeriouslyLaugh: but i'm assuming that its not installed because i dont need it?
[04:14] <mib_mib> SeriouslyLaugh: why would ifdown / ifup not work?
[04:14] <lotuspsychje> d21anthony: when doing a fresh install, its also reccomended to update your packages to latest, not going back to older ones
[04:15] <lotuspsychje> d21anthony: use aptoncd to back them up, put on fresh install and update
[04:15] <SeriouslyLaugh> d21anthony look into something like timeshift -- it takes a snapshot of your current system and can act as a restore point
[04:15] <d21anthony> lotuspsychje: gotcha. thanks!
[04:16] <SeriouslyLaugh> d21anthony http://www.howtogeek.com/206491/how-to-restore-your-ubuntu-linux-system-to-its-previous-state/ -- this is a third party application so obviously be careful
[04:16] <Spethus> i relly hate the way windows 10 has gone it has given me good reason to explore linux as an alternative
[04:17] <lotuspsychje> SeriouslyLaugh: please also mention the risk of ppa use when sugesting those mate
[04:17] <SeriouslyLaugh> !ppa
[04:17] <ubottu> A Personal Package Archive (PPA) can provide alternate software not normally available in the offical Ubuntu repositories - Looking for a PPA?

[04:17] <lotuspsychje> tnx
[04:17] <SeriouslyLaugh> np
[04:18] <d21anthony> www.webupd8.org are always solid from my experience
[04:18] <d21anthony> java, sublime, etc
[04:18] <SeriouslyLaugh> mib_mib apologies, i made a typo. try man networkmanager
[04:18] <d21anthony> solid for PPA's that is
[04:19] <Spethus> how safe are pps's as a general guide ?
[04:19] <lotuspsychje> d21anthony: still ppa's can damage system
[04:19] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: their not officially supported, so use at your own risk
[04:19] <mib_mib> SeriouslyLaugh: anyway, my main problem is that after setting my ip and hostname, i restart my server, but for some reason the DNS seems to be messed up on it, i dont see any 'errors' i only see "Deferring dns to <server 1>"
[04:20] <SeriouslyLaugh> equivalent to after market parts for a car -- not officially approved by the manufacture and may void the warranty
[04:20] <d21anthony> Although that is totally true - "risky business" it's been my go to for yearws
[04:20] <mib_mib> SeriouslyLaugh: nope, i guess i will need to install networkmanager? no entry for networkmanager
[04:21] <SeriouslyLaugh> mib_mib i think so, unfortunately i've reached the extent of my knowledge on this topic but do stay in the channel in case anyone else sees your error and knows the solution
[04:21] <d21anthony> SeriouslyLaugh: , lotuspsychje: which distro's are you currently using. 15.10 or 15.04?
[04:22] <lotuspsychje> !discuss | d21anthony 14.04.3
[04:22] <ubottu> d21anthony 14.04.3: Want to talk about Ubuntu but don't have a support question. Join #ubuntu-discuss, for other non-support discussion not Ubuntu related you can also join #ubuntu-offtopic. Thank you.

[04:24] <Spethus> sorry im new and not really tech savy , just sick of windows invading my privacy
[04:24] <Guest8886> i have upgraded to Ubuntu 14, trying to connect to internet using Tata Photon India,
[04:25] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: this is an ubuntu support channel mate, zorin not supported here
[04:25] <Guest8886> ok
[04:25] <Guest8886> where should i ask ?
[04:25] <Spethus> isnt zorin basically ubuntu version
[04:25] <lotuspsychje> Guest8886: that wasnt for you
[04:25] <Guest8886> ok
[04:25] <lotuspsychje> Guest8886: do you have an ubuntu issue on your upgrade?
[04:26] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: its not officialy supported here
[04:26] <cfhowlett> Spethus, zorin is not ubuntu, ubuntu is not zorin.   go to zorin for support
[04:26] <cfhowlett> !flavors | Spethus
[04:26] <ubottu> Spethus: !Ubuntu-GNOME, !Kubuntu, !Xubuntu and !Lubuntu are simply flavors of Ubuntu that come with GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and LXDE (respectively) installed as default, instead of Unity. Other specialized flavors of Ubuntu include !Edubuntu, Ubuntu !Studio, and !Mythbuntu.

[04:27] <rickyvelasc> Hello
[04:27] <d21anthony> thx
[04:27] <lotuspsychje> d21anthony: cheers :p
[04:27] <Spethus> sorry i thought the basic issue would still apply , i will shut up

[04:27] <Guest8886> lotuspsychje : upgraded successfully, but not able to connect to internet, using Tata Photon India
[04:27] <lotuspsychje> Guest8886: wifi or cable?
[04:28] <Guest8886> wifi
[04:28] <lotuspsychje> Guest8886: can you see your wifi icon?
[04:28] <treversir> Wifi is hard Guest8886
[04:28] <lotuspsychje> !behelpful | treversir
[04:28] <ubottu> treversir: As our !guidelines say, "When helping, be helpful". If you're not familiar with the issue at hand, let someone else handle it instead of making !offtopic comments or jokes.
=== Guest8886 is now known as nnn
[04:33] <Spethus> sorry not familiar with the elitist versions of help guess this is why people stick to windows
=== nnn is now known as hppy
[04:33] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: this has nothing to do with being 'elite'
[04:34] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: we all have seperated channels, to be able to help users the best way
[04:34] <Spethus> well as a new linux user looking for help it sure looks like it from the response'
[04:35] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: the response was clear and pointed you to the right channel
[04:35] <ha1dfo> cfhowlett, hi, remember yestreday had some troubles with crome -- figured out in the meanwhile, it installs corrupted .desktop files under ~/.local
[04:35] <cfhowlett> Spethus, the response was correct.  for best results go to your chosen distro channels.  if THEY don't support their own distro, you seriously expect US to??  really?
[04:35] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: what else did you wish for?
[04:35] <hppy> I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and unable to connect tata photon wifi please solve this issue?
[04:35] <cfhowlett> ha1dfo, I recall a suggestion to use a virtualbox windows.  you might explore that.
[04:36] <Spethus> sorry confused i thought my distro was based on unbuntu so i might have thought someone might have been able to help but hey i guess i'm wrong !
[04:36] <cfhowlett> Spethus, feel free to return here for support after you install one of the official ubuntu flavors.  best of luck to you.
[04:39] <lotuspsychje> ha1dfo: tnx for the feedback
[04:40] <HewloThere> Hi. I'm having trouble setting up a directory so that the directory can be edited by the 2 users. One controls the application (AMP/McMyAdmin) and I need a second user to be jailed within a directory inside it, but also have read/write.
[04:40] <HewloThere> I'm on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS.
[04:41] <dougbb> I have an AMD A-10 processor with ATI/Radeon R6 graphics. Using 15.10 I am having terrible problems with the X server not coming back from power save mode. I've tried the Xorg drivers, and also the lgrx drivers. lgrxinfo shows that things are Ok, but at least half the time I have to power cycle if the screen shuts off. Any suggestions?
[04:41] <cfhowlett> HewloThere, sounds like something the #ubuntu-server channel would know about
[04:41] <HewloThere> Oh, sorry cfhowlett. I thought this was for all Ubuntu. :)
[04:42] <cfhowlett> HewloThere, it is but that particular function sounds more server focused than this channel
[04:42] <dougbb> HewloThere:  make a group that contains only the two users, and have everything in the directory and below it with that group
[04:42] <cfhowlett> of course, ubuntu gurus get around to all channels sooner or later ^^
[04:42] <HewloThere> dougbb: I also need to chroot one of the users and I've followed numerous guides. I've had a bit of trouble doing it before.
[04:43] <dougbb> like cfhowlett said, that's a bit beyond this channel ... but it's a soluble problem
[04:44] <HewloThere> Alright. Will post it in Ubuntu server. :) Thanks for that!
[04:44] <cfhowlett> do what you do best dougbb !
[04:45] <dougbb> I'm still hoping someone can answer my question :-/
[04:45] <dougbb> it's driving me nutso
[04:45] <HewloThere> I wish I could help, sorry doug. :(
[04:46] <cfhowlett> dougbb, might want to see the amd forums.
[04:46] <dougbb> HewloThere: no worries, thanks for the thought
[04:46] <dougbb> cfhowlett: here, or actual web forums?
[04:46] <cfhowlett> dougbb, go to amd.com and search for support options
[04:47] <dougbb> oh, yeah ... no support for kernel 4+
[04:47] <Spethus> what is the easiest to learn supported ubuntu version this channel allows to get support coming from windows
[04:47] <mib_mib> hi - i think i'm having a problem with UFW - somehow interfering with my DNS - how can i see if its blocking DNS? i dont see anything in /var/log/ufw.log
[04:48] <HewloThere> Spethus: What do you want to use Ubuntu for?
[04:48] <Spethus> gaming specifaclly rift , photogrphy software email and internet i guess
[04:48] <Bashing-om> dougbb: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=AMDGPU-Xorg-1.0 . AMD has released the new drivers for 15.10, but so far as I know they have not hit our repo .
[04:49] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: we just told you not to use this channel for zorin
[04:49] <Spethus> wifi seems a problem with linux
[04:49] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: why did you come back?
[04:49] <Spethus> maybe thats why i askes what distro to change to
[04:50] <HewloThere> Spethus: Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.04 or newer should be relatively similar or the same on the GUI side. There isn't a lot of photography software available for it, except GIMP as far as I know.
[04:50] <lotuspsychje> !manual | Spethus here
[04:50] <ubottu> Spethus here: The Ubuntu Manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as surfing the web, listening to music and scanning documents. With an emphasis on easy to follow instructions, it is suitable for all levels of experience. http://ubuntu-manual.org/
[04:50] <dougbb> Spethus: wifi is well handled in linux, but newer cards sometimes lack support since it takes time to write drivers, and win/mac are the priorities
[04:50] <lotuspsychje> HewloThere: there are a lot of packages out there for ubuntu, be carefull what to suggest
[04:51] <mib_mib> I see this answer - i **may** be having this problem - what is this actually doing though? http://serverfault.com/questions/416727/ufw-blocking-apt-and-dns
[04:51] <lotuspsychje> mib_mib: maybe the #netfilter guys can help?
[04:51] <dougbb> Bashing-om: that looks very promising, thanks!
[04:51] <HewloThere> lotuspsychje: Well, IIRC, compared to Windows there isn't a lot of photo editing software (sorry, they may have meant something else). All I know there is is GIMP.
[04:52] <dougbb> fortunately gimp is a very powerful tool :)
[04:52] <HewloThere> GIMP is powerful, yes, although I'm not sure it's as good as Photoshop.
[04:52] <Bashing-om> dougbb: http://news.softpedia.com/news/open-source-amdgpu-linux-driver-released-supports-the-latest-amd-gpus-496545.shtml .
[04:53] <lotuspsychje> HewloThere: read up: http://codecondo.com/top-photo-editors-for-linux/
[04:54] <HewloThere> I could be wrong, sorry. o.O
[04:55] <Spethus> thanks Hewlother i had origanally chose zorin just based on something i read on the net about being easy for a new linux user but its looking like its not so simple to change to linux i will try download unbuntu 14 and see if i can get everything running again
[04:55] <lotuspsychje> HewloThere: always keep your mind open for new things :p
[04:56] <HewloThere> lotuspsychje: I am very open minded and I have LibreOffice installed and use it more than MS Office (lol). I just didn't know there was anything other than GIMP because I'm a Windows desktop and Linux server guy.
[04:56] <HewloThere> Spethus: Perhaps dual boot or run live CD.
[04:56] <dougbb> Spethus: you can deal with your wifi concerns easily ... download one of the live CDs, and give it a test drive :)
[04:56] <lotuspsychje> dougbb: +1
[04:57] <dougbb> Spethus: personally I find xubuntu to be very easy to use, and the interface will be fairly familiar to a windows user
[04:57] <Spethus> yeah that worked real well for zorin too , i still had to mess around alot to get wifi to work
[04:57] <dougbb> Spethus: do you happen to know what kind of wifi card you have?
[04:58] <Spethus> no but i found something that worked for general ubuntu tht got it workihg
[04:59] <dougbb> Ok
[05:00] <dougbb> I'd download the latest (15.10) just to be on the safe side ... I have a new'ish laptop and the card is only supported in kernel 4+ (for example)
[05:00] <fullstack> I have two encrypted volume groups with the same default name, ubuntu-vg
[05:00] <lotuspsychje> dougbb: latest doenst mean best, better choose LTS for stable
[05:01] <fullstack> is it impossible to mount the second one? When I do cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdc5 SOMENAME
[05:01] <Spethus> so hopefully if i find it again on google i can get it going under a "supported ubuntu" distro
[05:01] <fullstack> then I try to mount it, I get Unknown filesystem type LVM2_member
[05:01] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: www.ubuntu.com
[05:01] <fullstack> then if I vgscan, I see two "ubuntu-vg" groups type lvm2
[05:02] <fullstack> any idea? am I screwed?
[05:02] <dougbb> Spethus: try the LTS first, but if that isn't as smooth as you like, consider 15.10
[05:02] <Spethus> thanks will do
[05:04] <Spethus> is lt a paid os
[05:04] <dougbb> well you don't have to pay for it, if that's what you mean :)
[05:05] <inteus> ubuntu is free
[05:05] <inteus> :)
[05:06] <Spethus> i don't mind paying for it if it works for me, but it wants payment
=== mnepton is now known as mneptok
[05:08] <lotuspsychje> Spethus: scroll to bottom= no tnx take mo to download
[05:10] <fullstack> So
[05:10] <fullstack> how do I mount a LVM volume group
[05:10] <fullstack> that I unlocked
[05:10] <fullstack> with cryptsetup
[05:10] <fullstack> that has the default name ubuntu-vg as my system's ubuntu-vg
[05:11] <lotuspsychje> !lvm | fullstack
[05:11] <ubottu> fullstack: Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO - For software RAID, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto
[05:11] <dougbb> d'oh, fake raid ... that's harsh  LOL
[05:11] <fullstack> There's no /dev/volumegroup or /dev/VolGroup001
[05:12] <fullstack> there's /dev/mapper/luks-<someUID>
[05:12] <fullstack> thats my file system, but I can't mount it
[05:13] <fullstack> because it saids unknown filesystem type LVM2-Member, which is fine. But when I do vgscan, there are two ubuntu-vg -- so how do I specify "Scan the second ubuntu-vg and then somehow magically create a volume group directory for that one so I can mount it"
[05:14] <fullstack> vgchange -a y doesn't create a /dev/volumegroup
[05:16] <fullstack> you get what I'm saying?
[05:17] <lotuspsychje> !patience | fullstack
[05:17] <ubottu> fullstack: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com/
[05:19] <fullstack> does ubuntu vgscan create mount points in a /dev directory?
[05:19] <dan34> hi
[05:19] <fullstack> hi dan34
[05:19] <dan34> I have an Acer laptop and just installed Ubuntu
[05:19] <dan34> but wireless is not working
[05:19] <dan34> hi fullstack
[05:19] <dan34> how may I fix my wireless?
[05:20] <lotuspsychje> dan34: ubuntu version and wifi card chipset?
[05:20] <fullstack> is your wireless card built in?
[05:20] <fullstack> or usb
[05:20] <dan34> yes
[05:20] <dan34> built in
[05:20] <ElOco> Just out of curiosity how does CHASE bank or any other banking site know which machine I'm using? I know about super-cookies, HTTP reffers, tracking scripts, and user-agents but I think they use something else. I just ask because I borked my debian box, had to reinstall the os, and had to go through the chase online banking verification process which I usually only have to do if I'm logging in from another ip address. I reinstalle
[05:20] <fullstack> dan34, do you see it when you type lspci
[05:21] <lotuspsychje> ElOco: ask in #debian please
[05:21] <fullstack> ElOco, your browser sends your OS
[05:21] <dan34> fullstack: yes, 03:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros Device 0042 (rev 30)
[05:21] <ElOco> I reinstalled the same os
[05:21] <daftykins> ElOco: OS, browser, geoIP... usual
[05:21] <fullstack> dan34: lotuspsychje asked what your os and chipset is do you know
[05:21] <dan34> oh
[05:22] <lotuspsychje> !atheros | dan34
[05:22] <ubottu> dan34: Wireless documentation, including how-to guides and troubleshooting information, can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:22] <dan34> fullstack: lotuspsychje Ubuntu 14.04.3 the chipset I don't know
[05:22] <fullstack> Atheros chipset I think is pretty popular.
[05:22] <fullstack> dan34 its atheros
[05:23] <fullstack> dan34, is there a physical switch on the laptop that has the wifi turned off? sorry stupid question
[05:23] <RJ45> Hi I am at my wits end here trying to get public key authentication working for SSH, I have been having problems getting 2 machines to connect with this, one of the machines I got working by changing some permissions, but the other machine doesn't work no-matter what I do, I have been following this  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys  to the letter
[05:23] <ElOco> geoip is disabled, I always use a private session for all my surfing, I use the better-privacy extension for firefox to clear every super cookie
[05:23] <dan34> fullstack: no physical switch
[05:24] <fullstack> RJ45, are you trying to ssh as root? because there is a setting that disables the ability to ssh into a machine as root in /etc/sshd_config that you have to reset.
[05:24] <RJ45> fullstack: nope, just as a regular user
[05:24] <fullstack> ElOco, geoip isn't something you can enable or disable
[05:24] <fullstack> RJ45, have you tried "ssh -vvv" and carefully watched what happens when you ssh?
[05:25] <dan34> fullstack: how would I fix my wireless issue?
[05:25] <fullstack> RJ45, and are you able to ssh public key to other machines
[05:25] <fullstack> dan34: did you read that WifiDocs ubottu posted?
[05:25] <ElOco> ah sorry I'm thinking about the "allow location" setting in the browser
[05:25] <ElOco> or show location whatever it is
[05:25] <dan34> fullstack: yes, but I',m not sure how to proceed
[05:26] <RJ45> fullstack: I can ssh with a password, but not with a public key, I am trying to get public key auth to work, I have been able to get it to work connecting from machine 2 to machine 1, but not the other way around
[05:26] <dougbb> ElOco: someone already told you that your topic is not suitable for this channel ... you might want to take a look at https://panopticlick.eff.org/, FYI
[05:26] <ElOco> fine
[05:27] <fullstack> dan34: lspci -nn
[05:27] <fullstack> dan34: and this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2228595
[05:28] <fullstack> dan34: something about disabling ipv6 to make it work
[05:28] <dougbb> RJ45: are you sure that you're running ssh-agent on machine 1? And what happens if you run the ssh -vvv command that fullstack suggested?
[05:28] <fullstack> wait, you are using agent forwarding? are you forwarding your agent and have agent forwarding on in the middle server?
[05:30] <dan34> fullstack: I don't have a wlan0
[05:30] <dan34>  iwconfig eth0      no wireless extensions.  lo        no wireless extensions.
[05:31] <fullstack> dan34, is it the same chipset listed from lspci -nn
[05:31] <fullstack> that they are talking about?
[05:31] <RJ45> dougbb: I tried it, I really don't understand what part of the debug output I should be concerned about
[05:31] <dougbb> ok, try this on machine 1:  ssh-add -l
[05:31] <dougbb> and tell us if it lists your key
[05:32] <dougbb> or if you get an error about it being unable to make a connection to your agent
[05:32] <dan34> fullstack: no mines does not include the model. Just: Network controller [0280]: Qualcomm Atheros Device [168c:0042] (rev 30)
[05:32] <RJ45> dougbb: agent has no identities
[05:32] <dougbb> ok, there is your problem :)
[05:32] <dougbb> ssh-add your key
[05:33] <fullstack> dan34 I googled that
[05:33] <fullstack> dan34: and I got this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1484159
[05:33] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1484159 in linux (Ubuntu) "Qualcomm Atheros Device [168c:0042] (rev 30) not working on Ubuntu" [Medium,Triaged]
[05:33] <dougbb> you will have to have the private key and the appropriate authorized_keys file on both systems, RJ45
[05:33] <fullstack> dan34 is your laptop like really new or from the future
[05:33] <RJ45> but I have generated keys on both machines and transferred them with ' ssh-copy-id ' for each machine
[05:33] <dan34> fullstack: I guess it's pretty new. Yes
[05:34] <fullstack> dan34: the last link in the bug report is a how to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2300861&page=3
[05:34] <RJ45> it should be fine, I ever made sure the permissions were okay
[05:34] <dougbb> RJ45: ok, that all sounds great, but you still haven't run ssh-add :)
[05:34] <fullstack> dan34: you'll need to download some kernel headers (instructions there) and build
[05:34] <fullstack> the module
[05:34] <dougbb> so the agent on machine1 doesn't have the key, so it can't use it to authenticate you
[05:35] <dan34> fullstack: aah, I will try
[05:35] <fullstack> dan34: looks like post #29 is the money shot you can probably get away with cut and pasting what tizo_rh did
[05:35] <dougbb> RJ45: run 'ssh-add -l' on machine2, you should see a listing for your key that you generated on machine2
[05:36] <dan34> fullstack: :) thanks
[05:37] <dan34> fullstack: the file is not available
[05:37] <dan34> fullstack: http://filebin.ca/2LVgpjSgiT56/backports-ath-2015-11-05.tar.bz2
[05:37] <dan34> is there another place I can get it from?
[05:38] <RJ45> dougbb: this makes no sense, I have never run ssh-add on that machine o.O
[05:38] <RJ45> but it has a key
[05:39] <RJ45> I'm pretty confused about a-lot of things here :/
[05:39] <dougbb> RJ45: I don't know what to tell you about that, but I can tell you for sure that you have identified your problem :)
[05:39] <fullstack> dan34 that usually means there's a newer version with a slightly different file name
[05:39] <RJ45> hm
[05:39] <dougbb> RJ45: we all started somewhere :0
[05:39] <fullstack> dan34: you'll need some google-fu to find what the file in the context of the conversation
[05:40] <RJ45> this guide  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys  should really be made more clear that ' ssh-add ' is required
[05:40] <dan34> alright
[05:40] <fullstack> dan34: your google fu isn't as good as mine
[05:40] <dougbb> RJ45: file a bug report :)
[05:40] <fullstack> dan34: here http://askubuntu.com/questions/697448/ubuntu-14-04-install-firmare-released-for-ath10k-pci
[05:41] <RJ45> it says to do it in troubleshooting if the response is "Permission denied (publickey)", but that was not my response
[05:41] <dan34> fullstack: not at all, thanks
[05:41] <fullstack> my google fu can not be matched.
[05:41] <fullstack> dan34 make sure you don't install 15.0x on your 14.04
[05:42] <nitish> How can I install wine 1.7?
[05:42] <RJ45> okay, slight problem here, I am still unable to connect using public key authentication
[05:42] <dan34> fullstack: alright, I'll be careful
[05:42] <RJ45> *face-palm*
[05:43] <fullstack> RJ45 have I talked to you before?
[05:43] <RJ45> fullstack: on another chan?
[05:43] <fullstack> yes
[05:44] <RJ45> maybe, are you on ##networking ##hardware #opennic or #bash ?
[05:44] <fullstack> nope. whats opennic about?
[05:44] <RJ45> it's an alternative DNS, it's pretty cool
[05:44] <fullstack> i think if we talk about non-ubuntu stuff people get pissed, so lets pretend its ubuntu
[05:44] <RJ45> https://opennicproject.org
[05:45] <fullstack> did you run apt-get sorry_dunno_what_opennic is?
[05:45] <RJ45> (sorry for going off-topic everyone)
[05:45] <fullstack> are you running 14.04 LTS and did you oh-opennic-looks-cool-thanks as sudo?
[05:45] <RJ45> technically I configured my DNS in Ubuntu, so it could be a Ubuntu topic :P
[05:45] <fullstack> j/k
[05:46] <dan34> fullstack: time for a reboot, wish me luck!
[05:46] <fullstack> dan34: praying
[05:47] <nitish> How can I install wine?
[05:49] <RJ45> again, I am still unable to connect from machine 1 to machine 2 using a public key
[05:49] <RJ45> even after running ssh-add on both machines
[05:50] <dougbb> is machine1's key reflected in machine2's authorized_keys file?
[05:50] <RJ45> yes, and vice-versa
[05:50] <dougbb> ok, so run ssh -vvv and paste the results
[05:51] <dougbb> or, pastebin I should say
[05:51] <RJ45> machine 2 is able to connect to machine 1 with a public key (though it was having troubles before I massed with file permissions)
[05:51] <dougbb> yes, we got that :)
[05:51] <RJ45> okay I'll do that
[05:52] <dan34> it didn't work :(
[05:54] <dan34> do you know where I can find backports-ath-2015-11-05.tar.bz2?
[05:54] <dan34> it's no longer available at http://filebin.ca/2LVgpjSgiT56/backports-ath-2015-11-05.tar.bz2
[05:56] <dougbb> RJ45: any luck?
[05:57] <RJ45> dougbb: I'm just trying to redact stuff I don't want shared from the paste, BRB
[06:00] <RJ45> err here  http://pastebin.com/9rSC7LGB
[06:02] <dougbb> RJ45: do you actually have an ecdsa key?
[06:03] <dougbb> or a plain dsa key?
[06:03] <RJ45> I'm not sure
[06:03] <jcadduono> hi guys i've been trying for hours to find a way to execute a shell script in screen over ssh, but it just seems impossible: ssh user@host -f "screen -dmS dostuff /home/user/dostuff.sh" that does...nothing at all
[06:04] <RJ45> dougbb: in the paste I changed it to "debug1: Server host key: ECDSA de:ad:be:ef:de:ad:be:ef:de:ad:be:ef:de:ad:be:ef"
[06:04] <RJ45> lol
[06:04] <dougbb> RJ45: what's in ~/.ssh on machine1 ?
[06:05] <dougbb> jcadduono: what is your purpose for trying to use screen there? what are you trying to accomplish?
[06:06] <RJ45> :~$ ls ~/.ssh
[06:06] <RJ45> authorized_keys  id_dsa  id_dsa.pub  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts  old bak
[06:06] <RJ45> that
[06:06] <dougbb> RJ45: ok ... did you create the dsa key on purpose, or was it something that the guide said you should do?
[06:06] <jcadduono> dougbb: i want to execute a script on another server in a screen session i can connect to later on, since the sh script goes on for a few hours
[06:06] <RJ45> I'm honestly not sure where that came from
[06:07] <RJ45> what does the dsa key do?
[06:07] <dougbb> jcadduono: do you want to "connect" to it because it's interactive, or because you need to see the results?
[06:07] <dougbb> RJ45: right now it's just confusing the issue :)   try moving those two dsa files out of ~/.ssh  for now
[06:08] <jcadduono> dougbb: i don't care to see the results at the time, i want to be able to check on it later on though by connecting through ssh and using screen -r
[06:08] <RJ45> k
[06:08] <Extreminador> how can i search for the directory x ?
[06:08] <daftykins> man find
[06:08] <Extreminador> thanks
[06:08] <fullstack> the man pages suck
[06:08] <dougbb> but your log shows that it properly presented the rsa key, and was rejected ... that tells me that authorized_keys is not correct on machine2 ... give that another look
[06:08] <fullstack> find ./ -name 'SOMENAME*LALALA*hahah*.txt'
[06:09] <dougbb> jcadduono: stop focusing on screen :)   focus on what you're trying to accomplish if you could use screen
[06:09] <dougbb> jcadduono: is your script interactive, or do you just want to see the results?
[06:09] <dougbb> (where results could be things that are being printed out by the script as it runs)
[06:09] <jcadduono> dougbb: the script is not interactive at all, i just wanna check on how its going once in a while in case there is an error
[06:09] <dougbb> ok
[06:10] <fullstack> if it didn't like your authorized_keys 9 times out of 10 its file permissions are to open
[06:10] <tyuiope> Is ubutu
[06:10] <RJ45> dougbb: the home on machine 1 is encrypted, but I solved that how the guide said, and machine 2 can connect to it, machine 2's home is not encrypted, so I set that up how the guide says
[06:11] <RJ45> I'll try re-transferring the key from machine 1 to machine 2
[06:11] <fullstack> how do I install the kernel headers?
[06:12] <jcadduono> dougbb: i could just do "ssh user@host SOMEVAR=something /home/user/dostuff.sh" and that would run the entire thing just fine...but i can't keep the ssh connection open for 3 hours, that's why i really want to use screen
[06:12] <daftykins> uname -r; apt install linux-headers-x.x.x=
[06:12] <daftykins> oops
[06:12] <daftykins> uname -r; apt install linux-headers-x.x.x-##-generic
[06:13] <daftykins> usually they're already there
[06:13] <RJ45> dougbb: did it, no change in behaviour
[06:13] <dougbb> jcadduono: you don't need screen for that, you can use nohup
[06:13] <dougbb> RJ45: do ls -lR ~/.ssh on machine2
[06:14] <fullstack> oh.. where are kernel headers stored?
[06:14] <daftykins> dpkg -L <header-package-name>
[06:15] <jcadduono> dougbb: are you saying it is impossible to use screen for the task? i really don't want to have to tail -f
[06:15] <Extreminador> it should be something like this to search for directory x --> find / -type d -name "x"
[06:15] <RJ45> big paste coming through!
[06:15] <RJ45> -rw-r--r-- 1 user2 user2  735 Nov 26 03:27 authorized_keys
[06:15] <RJ45> -rw------- 1 user2 user2 3326 Nov 26 04:33 id_rsa

[06:15] <RJ45> -rw------- 1 user2 user2 1108 Oct  4 00:06 known_hosts
[06:15] <Extreminador> cause if it is it's not finding nothing
[06:15] <OerHeks> don't paste like that, RJ45

[06:16] <dougbb> RJ45: the authorized keys file should be 0600
[06:16] <dougbb> and what are the permissions for the directory itself?
[06:16] <RJ45> OerHeks: sorry but it seemed a bit silly to make a pastebin for a paste so small
[06:16] <dougbb> jcadduono: there is nothing wrong with tail -f
[06:16] <jcadduono> dougbb: ok now it's an interactive script
[06:16] <dougbb> and over-dependence on screen makes for a lazy/uncreative sysadmin :0
[06:17] <nitish> How can I book a tatkal ticket from irctc?
[06:17] <RJ45> dougbb: so I should chmod 600 ?
[06:17] <dougbb> RJ45: yes, and answer my other question :)
[06:17] <OerHeks> nitish, wrong channel
[06:18] <nitish> oh.. how can I install WINE?
[06:18] <OerHeks> nitish, you know how, stop trolling please.
[06:18] <RJ45> dougbb: I'm not sure about the directory itself, but should I chmod it 700?
[06:18] <dougbb> RJ45: yes
[06:19] <dougbb> also, look in /var/log/auth.log on machine2, that might have a useful error message
[06:19] <RJ45> okay, after changing the permissions connecting is still the same :/
[06:19] <nitish> OerHeks: sudo apt-get install wine is not working. I need to install stable version i.e. 1.6.2. Do i need to add ppa to repository?
[06:20] <OerHeks> nitish, yes, that is working.
[06:21] <RJ45> Nov 26 06:19:19 user2-ThinkPad-X61 sshd[19649]: Authentication refused: bad ownership or modes for directory /home/user2
[06:21] <RJ45> that was in the log
[06:21] <dougbb> yeah, sounds right ... what does ls -l ~ say?
[06:22] <nitish> OerHeks: yeh its working. actually i was checking it by only typing "wine" and install instruction was not appearing. but sudo apt-get install wine is still working.
[06:22] <RJ45> dougbb: all the permission for every file in my home
[06:22] <dougbb> sorry
[06:22] <dougbb> 'ls -ld !
[06:22] <dougbb> err
[06:23] <dougbb> ls -ld ~
[06:23] <dougbb> that'll show just the directory
[06:23] <RJ45> drwxrwxrwx 49 user2 user2 4096 Nov 26 03:50 /home/user2
[06:24] <dougbb> ok, that's a whole new set of problems :)
[06:24] <dougbb> chmod 0755 ~
[06:24] <RJ45> oh my lord, what rabbit hole have I dragged myself into.. x_x
[06:25] <dougbb> you haven't ... you're following guides instead of understanding what you're doing :)   That's a problem that can only be solved by experience, unfortunately
[06:25] <RJ45> before I chmod it, I want to understand, what is the problem?, I have no problem accessing anything in my home directory as the user
[06:25] <dougbb> do you know what those permissions mean?
[06:26] <RJ45> vaguely, I know chmod 777 is party time for everyone :P
[06:26] <dougbb> well there you go
[06:27] <dougbb> that's very insecure, and ssh is all about security
[06:27] <RJ45> heheh
[06:27] <RJ45> what confuses me is how machine 2 got so messed-up in the first place
[06:28] <dougbb> the uncharitable answer is that you probably followed a guide of some sort :)
[06:28] <RJ45> ahah good one
[06:29] <OerHeks> it is all there > https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys
[06:29] <RJ45> well after hours of me throwing my limited experience at the problem, and about an hour of help from folks here, ssh is now working with public keys for me, great :D

[06:36] <rogger_h> i got some issue, i get *1 directory index of "/usr/share/nginx/html/" is forbidden, on the error log
[06:36] <rogger_h> ideas?
[06:36] <daftykins> permissions, check them
[06:36] <somsip> rogger_h: sounds like a nginx.conf issue. Maybe ask in #nginx or similar
[06:36] <dougbb> yeah, not really a ubuntu issue :)
[06:37] <dougbb> rogger_h: the good news is that it's easy to fix, and the #nginx folks should be able to help you out :)
[06:39] <rogger_h> they are not asnwering for days
[06:40] <logglog> OerHeks: thx i will check it right now
[06:40] <dougbb> rogger_h: have you tried a web search on that error message?
[06:40] <rogger_h> yes cound find something helpfull
[06:41] <daftykins> i already mentioned permissions...
[06:41] <dougbb> rogger_h: http://nginxlibrary.com/enable-directory-listing/
[06:41] <daftykins> likely, nginx executes as a user which does not have rights over /usr/share/nginx/html/
[06:42] <dougbb> ... and if that doesn't work, what daftykins said :)
[06:43] <rogger_h> hmm
[06:43] <rogger_h> location /somedir {                autoindex on;
[06:43] <rogger_h> there is "somedir"
[06:44] <rogger_h> i dont get it , if i put here subdir how could it help
[06:44] <rogger_h> daftykins: maybe, how can i check that
[06:44] <dougbb> rogger_h: this really isn't the right place for basic web server configuration
[06:45] <daftykins> ps -ef | grep nginx ; to see what user it runs as; then "ls -al /usr/share/nginx/" to see what the html folder is owned as
[06:45] <daftykins> rogger_h: then visit the nginx docs site and learn how to actually use it, as you strike me as a beginner
[06:46] <rogger_h> drwxr-xr-x  15 root root       4096 Nov 26 01:49 html
[06:47] <fullstack> anybody have luck with vmware and ubuntu 14.04?
[06:47] <Extreminador> what key's i need to press to exist --> Escape character is '^]'.  ??
[06:47] <dougbb> fullstack: define "luck"  :)
[06:47] <fullstack> like it works
[06:47] <dougbb> Extreminador: that's Ctrl-]
[06:48] <dougbb> fullstack: ubuntu as the host, or as a guest?
[06:48] <fullstack> host
[06:48] <Extreminador> not working dougbb
[06:48] <Extreminador> ctrl + "key 9"
[06:49] <logglog> OerHeks: How can find the URL for the Ubuntu i want to connect with for printing
[06:49] <dougbb> Ok ... I used to use it that a lot ... worked fine ... there were some patches that needed to be applied for the kernel modules, but that may be fixed in newer versions of vmware
[06:49] <dougbb> Extreminador: I'm not sure what key 9 is supposed to be .... you need to use the right square bracket
[06:49] <dougbb> The ] key
[06:49] <rogger_h> ok i change chown/chgrp permission so now im like nginx nginx       4096 Nov 26 01:49 html
[06:49] <rogger_h> but still not working
[06:50] <dougbb> rogger_h: did you change the config to enable directory listing as described in the page I pasted for you?
[06:50] <daftykins> rogger_h: well you didn't actually share the result of the first, so as fun as commenting on 50% of the information is
[06:50] <dougbb> it's not on by default
[06:50] <Extreminador> yehh the key 9 on a portuguese keyboard has 3 function ... the 9 (no need to press any other key), the ( need to press shift+9 and the ] need to press altgr+9
[06:51] <fullstack> guys should I start eating the thanksgiving food right now?
[06:51] <fullstack> j/k
[06:51] <rogger_h> now the folder is owned by nginx
[06:51] <logglog> Hey ppl is there a way to put spellchecking in libreoffice off, I cant find that option even searching the net
[06:51] <Extreminador> dougbb need to press ctrl+altgr+9
[06:51] <dougbb> Extreminador: looks that way
[06:51] <Extreminador> worked now
[06:51] <Extreminador> mybe i miss press
[06:52] <daftykins> rogger_h: right but what user does nginx run as...
[06:52] <logglog> found
[06:53] <rogger_h> hmm
[06:53] <rogger_h> i dont know that how to answer that
[06:53] <dougbb> rogger_h: you would, if you were paying attention :)
[06:53] <daftykins> rogger_h: by running "ps -ef | grep nginx" as mentioned first.
[06:53] <daftykins> rogger_h: it's immensely useful to read advice that's given
[06:54] <rogger_h> let me show u the results
[06:54] <daftykins> if it's multiple lines, pasting into the channel would require immediate seppuku
[06:54] <rogger_h> http://pastie.org/private/e6fdr0cl34ohqsb593qkpq
[06:55] <daftykins> now you should restart nginx
[06:56] <rogger_h> i did that already
[06:56] <rogger_h> and nothing
[06:56] <daftykins> what are you even doing to test... what's in the document root?
[06:57] <rogger_h> its a website
[06:57] <rogger_h> i mvoed to another server
[06:57] <daftykins> so there's an index in there? are the files all owned by nginx too?
[06:57] <dougbb> if it's a website, you probably don't want directory indexing on by default anyway :)
[06:58] <daftykins> ls -al /usr/share/nginx/html/
[06:58] <daftykins> you probably shouldn't be doing web admin if you're tripping up at these basics
[06:59] <rogger_h> yes i know but im stuck here and need help
=== justinK is now known as justin_k
[07:00] <daftykins> still waiting...

[07:00] <justin_k> Can anyone help with diagnose my crash reports?
[07:01] <rogger_h> magento website
[07:01] <daftykins> oy
[07:02] <dougbb> yeah, that's going to be way beyond the ability of a neophyte web admin to deal with
[07:03] <daftykins> this is what we get all the time; youngsters going "i really want to set this up quickly!" - you're going to get your ass hacked. you don't know how to drive this product, don't know how to administrate it... set it up... anything.
[07:03] <daftykins> and now you want to use an ecommerce platform, potentially deal with folks real money - just no.
[07:03] <justin_k> Whenever I boot it takes maybe 2 minutes to get to the lock screen and then I have 3 System Error reports
[07:03] <hello9> anyone ever developer iphone apps (objective-c) on ubuntu? if so, what did you use? (virtual machine?)
[07:04] <daftykins> justin_k: a problem happening once is kept in the log path and will be displayed on every boot, so there might not even be anything wrong
[07:04] <fullstack> hello9, its practically impossible
[07:04] <dougbb> justin_k: what kind of graphics driver do you have?
[07:04] <justin_k> ive cleared my crash folder and it still happens
[07:04] <justin_k> geforce
[07:04] <dougbb> ah, ok
[07:04] <hello9> @fullstack yeh i figured, i heard the ram itself on a vm has to be like 4gb or something haha
[07:04] <rogger_h> daftykins: so what is ur suggestion?
[07:04] <rogger_h> how do i continue from here
[07:05] <daftykins> rogger_h: i already asked for info and didn't receive it, so i'm done
[07:05] <daftykins> cya
[07:05] <rogger_h> what info?
[07:05] <rogger_h> i didnt see ur request
[07:05] <dougbb> rogger_h: you need to pay someone who is knowledgeable to admin this for you ... you really want a full-service hosting platform of some sort
[07:05] <rogger_h> i was searching , didnt find someone
[07:06] <fullstack> hello9, the problems are multiple. You can run open source software on a rooted iphone, but there isn't a big enough community to keep the toolchain up to date and user base for the applications. The apple app store is superior. unfortunately its very locked down to osx/xcode. You can run osx in a virtual machine under ubuntu however. And then there's stuff like PhoneGap, Ionic, and React Native
=== xtgu is now known as gu
[07:06] <hello9> @fullstack ah i see, thx
[07:06] <fullstack> hello9, but running OSX in a virtual machine is crappy. Its easier to just buy a mac

[07:07] <hello9> yeah, i dont really like macs tho
[07:07] <hello9> haha
[07:07] <hello9> but obj-c looks like a weird language
[07:07] <hello9> kinda wanted to see what was going on there
[07:07] <hello9> practically
[07:08] <somsip> hello9: you can setup the gnustep libraries and compile objC to have a play, but you wont get the iOS SDK on there AFAICT
[07:08] <dougbb> rogger_h: you don't want a person, you want a company ...  a full-service e-commerce platform

[07:09] <dougbb> rogger_h: no, you don't ... what daftykins said is very true

[07:09] <somsip> rogger_h: go to a freelancer site and make an ad. But you're waaaay off topic and frankly a bit whiney now
[07:09] <dougbb> you are so inexperienced you don't even know how impossible what you're asking is
[07:09] <dougbb> that's not an insult, it's just a fact
[07:12] <rogger_h> hmm
[07:12] <rogger_h> ok
