[02:19] <lupine_85> source code != headers
[02:19] <m0> In order to build the VPN kernel module, you must have the

[02:19] <lupine_85> either way, it's in /usr/src somewhere

[02:25] <lupine_85> rmorris84: does sudo iwlist scan work? and do you have ssid broadcast enabled in the router?
[02:25] <ArrenLex> Georgy: been there. That's fglrx. Been there. Don't want it.
[02:25] <Wyzard> m0: You want the -686 one
[02:25] <lupine_85> if the answers are no, then yes... you should try a later version of ndiswrapper, &/or a different windows driver

[02:55] <Bacaruda> is there a way I can test it to see if OpenGL is working outside of like downloading Q3 demo
[02:55] <chuckyp> admin_, no when you first boot the cd.....  There is a menu that you can select memtest etc.... one of them should be safe graphics mode.

[02:57] <admin_> chukyp: i also know what you mean by that menu, i have experience with ubuntu, but all this cd has at beggiing is just a few lines of text, andt hen "boot: "
[02:57] <THX-1138> Bacaruda - Cool.

[02:58] <chuckyp> dredhammer, properly
[02:58] <THX-1138> bring up synaptic and search xcompmgr (xgl/compiz is a bit fancier but somewhat more complex and bleeding edge
[02:58] <dredhammer> yes
[02:59] <dredhammer> it has to be a hard reboot not a ctrl+alt+backspace
[02:59] <chuckyp> dredhammer, are you rebooting leaving the cd in the drive or just reinserting after reboot?
[02:59] <kitche> Waterbou: amarok and maybe banshee
[02:59] <Bacaruda> yeah Ive used XGL on a Live CD before that was awesome
[02:59] <imbrandon> shmulik: sure
[02:59] <Wyzard> As I understand it, AIGLX is the real way forward, not XGL
[02:59] <chuckyp> dredhammer, ctrl+alt+backspace isn't a reboot it just restarts x windows.

[03:22] <jUggERNAUt1980> viator is right, you can manually switch between wlan0 or ath0 if you want to, depending on which controller you want it to manage.

[03:23] <Wyzard> You can manually switch, but you do it by picking "wired connection" or a wireless network from a pop-up menu, not by typing "eth0" or "eth1" in a text box
[03:23] <jUggERNAUt1980> but it doesn't even do that, so i'm thinking that i need to manually configure nm to do what it's supposed to do automatically.
[03:23] <Wyzard> In your case it sounds like it's just not seeing your wireless interface

[03:24] <Wyzard> but in Debian at least, NM ignores interfaces that are configured in /etc/network/interfaces
[03:24] <viator> jUggERNAUt1980 do you have the little monitor scrren icons on your panel

[03:24] <Wyzard> which I think is what that thing on the Administration menu configures, though I haven't used that

[03:51] <charles_> Dr_willis Where should i install it to start?
[03:51] <Wyzard> jUggERNAUt1980: Use that to test the drive for problems...  you might need to get it replaced
[03:51] <viator> juggernaut you using a native linux driver
[03:51] <Bacaruda> is there a way to edit what appears in the menus on GNOME?

[03:52] <unfknblvbl> Bacaruda: right-click on the ubuntu logo in the top left and go edit menu
[03:52] <Wyzard> I think NM supports most wireless drivers these days, though some esoteric ones might not be supported
[03:52] <charles_> where should i install a program so i don't need to be root to extract files there later?
[03:52] <jUggERNAUt1980> wyzard thanks for that!  :)
[03:53] <Bacaruda> thx
[03:53] <viator> i have the driverloader
[03:53] <Wyzard> jUggERNAUt1980: Good thing NM didn't work right, or you would never have looked and seen that  :-)
[03:53] <unfknblvbl> np
[03:53] <jUggERNAUt1980> wyzard, heck yes!
[03:53] <Dr_willis> charles_,   i just install it in the users home dir. since i dont want it installed system wide
[03:54] <charles_> I get what your saying but i don't know which is user wide and what is specific to my user
[03:55] <viator> does ubuntu support the BCM4318 even through ndiswraaper yet
[03:55] <jUggERNAUt1980> wyzard, my bluetooth seems to be working ok, but i don't have anythig that connects via bluetooth!  :P

[03:57] <Wyzard> jUggERNAUt1980: It's possible that your wireless chipset just isn't supported, which is why I asked you to look for informational messages from NetworkManager in syslog

=== bretzel [n=bretzel@Toronto-HSE-ppp3779959.sympatico.ca]  has joined #ubuntu
[03:58] <jUggERNAUt1980> wyzard, the chipset seems to be fine, but i see this message in syslog:  NetworkManager: <WARNING>^I nm_dbus_get_networks_cb (): nm-dbus-nmi.c:522 (nm_dbus_get_networks_cb): error received: org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerInfo.NoNetworks - There are no wireless networks stored..
[03:58] <Wyzard> jUggERNAUt1980: On my Ubuntu box I see messages in syslog saying that NetworkManager has found both eth0 and eth1 and that they're fully-supported
[03:58] <jUggERNAUt1980> wyzard, i see those messages for eth0 only, but not ath0
[03:58] <Wyzard> jUggERNAUt1980: That doesn't look like the root cause of a problem...  looks like something's asking for a list of wireless networks, and NM can't respond because it doesn't know about any
[03:59] <charles_> i am running with sudo but when i do the extract i'm doing it without terminol and i don't know how to use sudo then
[03:59] <jUggERNAUt1980> wyzard, that's how i interpreted it, too.  it doesn't seem to be trying to access ath0 at all, but i'm on wirelessly right now.
[03:59] <Wyzard> jUggERNAUt1980: What type of wireless chipset do you have?
[03:59] <Half-Left> charles_, you could just do sudo nautilus --no-desktop and extract the files like normal
[03:59] <Wyzard> jUggERNAUt1980: Atheros 5212 by any chance?

[04:01] <Bluhd> Wyzard: should I apt-get install that?
