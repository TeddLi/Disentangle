[12:07] <Langley> Thanks I'll try that
[12:10] <Axton> In setting up ssh for pw free acces. When I have copied my p key to server and connect, it ask me if I wanna add server to known_host. I type "yes" and it then ask for a password. Which password is it asking for? User pw on server? Passphrase for key? user pw on client?
[12:11] <k1l> on client
[12:11] <Seveas> Axton: which key did you copy and how? Can you pastebin the output of this command on the server: ls -laR ~/.ssh
[12:12] <Langley> I don't have any /etc/default/grub ... do you know if it's different on ARM, mcphail ?
[12:12] <stimoceiver> whats the preferred driver for my Radeon R9-290? With the default driver, apps like youtube or mplayer are definitely not running accelerated. I see two packages, fglrx and fglrx-updates. Whats the deal?
[12:12] <k1l> Langley: ARM is a total different setup.
[12:13] <mcphail> Langley: no idea about ARM, I'm afraid
[12:13] <Axton> Seveas: http://pastebin.com/2J2EGEh4
[12:13] <k1l> Langley: better ask in #ubuntu-arm for help and name the exact hardware you use etc.
[12:13] <wumpus> with ARM you have a bootloader (e.g. uboot) instead of grub
[12:13] <Langley> Ugh... okay, thanks
[12:13] <wumpus> this differs per device unfortunately, some are supported out of the box, some need manual fidgeting
[12:14] <mcphail> Langley: I have an old ARM device running Debian, but I have never been brave enough to tackle uboot :(
[12:14] <Seveas> Axton: ok, those permissions look good. And the content of authorized_keys is the same as your local public (not private!) key?
[12:15] <Langley> Well I think I found it... it's configured in /boot/config.txt
[12:15] <wumpus> messing with uboot can brick your device, so if there is no way to recover it's not recommended
[12:15] <stimoceiver> whats the preferred driver for my Radeon R9-290? With the default driver, apps like youtube or mplayer are definitely not running accelerated. I see two packages, fglrx and fglrx-updates. Whats the deal? or should I use the stuff from the xorg-edgers ppa??? Cuz I definitely end up needing crap like RandR on some of my monitors...
[12:16] <wumpus> (eg a serial console, jtag, some vendor-supported to re-flash the firmware over USB, ...)
[12:17] <Axton> Seveas: Yeah, im pretty sure. I have used ssh-copy-id to copy it over...
[12:17] <Axton> Seveas: I have ssh acces to server without pw on local network, but if I try with ip from ISP it ask for my password...
[12:18] <Seveas> ah, the server is behind a nat? Is the port forwarded properly?
[12:18] <Axton> Seveas: I can see in the debug output that it connect
[12:19] <Axton> Seveas: Ill just make a pastebin with ssh -vvv output
[12:19] <Seveas> Axton: but is it connecting to the right thing?
[12:20] <Seveas> does the connection attempt show up in /var/log/messages or /var/log/auth.log on the server?
[12:21] <Axton> Seveas: http://pastebin.com/HwNmk2Dd
[12:22] <Axton> Seveas: I am not sure. I have changed loglevel to VERBOSE in sshd_config but im not sure its in the log. Only entry for the local connection is in the log... I think, not sure..!
[12:23] <Seveas> debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version dropbear_0.46
[12:23] <Seveas> I bet that's the ssh on your router
[12:24] <Seveas> which really shouldn't be made publicly accessible, you should fix that first...
[12:24] <Axton> Seveas: When i forwarded the port on my router it told me that the router ssh was moved to another port
[12:26] <Seveas> Axton: looks like it lied.
[12:26] <Axton> Seveas: I think your right... I just got into my router and removed ssh. Now i just get a connection refused...
=== dreamon__ is now known as dreamon
[12:28] <Axton> Seveas: All this shit actually started course my F#%& ISP flashed the router and all of the settings. When i redid the settings, I got a man-in-the-middle dialog when connecting to my server... 2 hours later, I still dont have connection to my server from outside the network....
[12:34] <Axton> Seveas: THX for the help. You notice that my router was messing up, Now I fixed everything..! I owe u a beer ;-)

[14:02] <lotuspsychje> C_minus: ubuntu version and wifi chipset please?
[14:03] <C_minus> 14.04 intel 7260
[14:03] <lotuspsychje> C_minus: try a tail -f /var/log/syslog and tail -f /var/log/dmesg and play around with wifi
[14:04] <hateball> C_minus: You'll want a recent kernel such as in 15.04 for 7260 to work properly. I have the same chipset
[14:04] <OerHeks> C_minus, were you here before ? intel 7260 should be supported OOTB in 15.10
[14:05] <OerHeks> oh, 15.04 too
[14:05] <C_minus> Yes i was. Funny, no sooner do I ask you guys about it, it connected straight away. I hate computers!
[14:05] <OerHeks> magic irc room
[14:05] <lotuspsychje> lol
[14:05] <cfhowlett> gremlins ...
[14:05] <hateball> the kernel in 14.04 can have problems unless you disable N or AC
[14:06] <hateball> but if you run 15.04 and onwards, everything works glorious
[14:06] <hateball> C_minus: ^
[14:06] <lotuspsychje> hateball: thats good to know, just for that chipset?
[14:06] <hateball> lotuspsychje: Well surely other chipsets can have malfunctioning drivers, I just happen to know about 7260 since I have it myself
[14:07] <lotuspsychje> hateball: ok nice
[14:07] <hateball> lotuspsychje: but it's not uncommon for various chipsets using iwlwifi/iwlagn to struggle, forcing you to disable N
[14:07] <lotuspsychje> hateball: does your card show firmware version? might be interesting to compare with him
[14:07] <C_minus> hmmm, that's interesting to know. i have been reluctant to upgrade to 15.04 because my laptop came with 14.04, and it has "long term support".
[14:08] <hateball> lotuspsychje: Sadly I am at work now, I have that chipset at home
[14:08] <lotuspsychje> kk
[14:08] <cfhowlett> C_minus, current version is 14.04.3 ...
[14:08] <hateball> Well the kernel/modules are still "old" in .3
[14:10] <lotuspsychje> hateball: so upgrading trusty kernel could be usefull in this case?
[14:10] <cfhowlett> can't hurt to try???
[14:10] <C_minus> How come I can't just install some driver that will make it work properly? I got the driver package from the Dell website, but it contains about 30 different .dpkg files whose names are just garbled strings of numbers and letters. Dell want you to use their "dell recovery tool" to load the driver package onto a stick (but this doesn't work).
[14:11] <C_minus> I might as well just upgrade to 15.04 for all the help dell has been.
[14:11] <lotuspsychje> C_minus: you can try few things now, 14.04.3 or kernel upgrade or 15.10
[14:12] <cfhowlett> C_minus, sudo apt full-upgrade will grab new kernels and package upgrades
[14:13] <C_minus> did i mention - it only gives me this problem at home. it connects to all other networks just fine. even its Win7 partition connects fine, as well as all other computers/phones/tablets.
[14:13] <MonkeyDust> am doing that now with 15.10 vm
[14:14] <hateball> C_minus: yes, it depends on how the SSID you're broadcasting is set up.
[14:14] <hateball> C_minus: That's why it can work properly if you disable N speeds, but then... you wont have N speeds
[14:15] <C_minus> sometimes the other machines struggle to connect to the home router for a while, but they come around. the androids say "acquiring IP address...", the Macs and the Win7s show a little exclaimation mark over their WIFI icons... but Ubuntu just tries and fails.
[14:15] <hateball> C_minus: If other devices struggle as well you might want to look into upgrading the routers firmware
[14:15] <C_minus> hateball yeah trouble is, the rest of the fam need the N speeds.
[14:16] <hateball> C_minus: Yes, but you can disable N in the intel driver in ubuntu
[14:16] <C_minus> i think its running latest. lousy D-Link router came free from the ISP.

[14:18] <iamrohit7> cfhowlett: its based on ubuntu, isn't it?
[14:18] <C_minus> while i'm here, what can I do about screen tearing while playing videos etc.?
[14:18] <cfhowlett> iamrohit7, it is.  but it is NOT ubuntu and not supported here.
[14:18] <cfhowlett> !elementary
[14:18] <ubottu> Elementary OS is an Ubuntu derivative which is supported in their IRC channel #elementary on irc.freenode.net - http://elementaryos.org/ for more information on this distribution.
[14:18] <hateball> C_minus: what GPU chipset are you using, and what browser?
[14:19] <iamrohit7> cfhowlett: there isn't much activity there.
[14:19] <hateball> C_minus: or is it tearing in video players outside the browser? the usual fail is flash, is why I am asking
[14:19] <lotuspsychje> iamrohit7: feel free to install an ubuntu version from topic
[14:19] <cfhowlett> iamrohit7, if you need support, I strongly urge you to install an official ubuntu flavor.  if elementary OS doesn't support you - perhaps there's a cosmic message for you rhtere
[14:19] <C_minus> not just browser. I have intel integrated graphics and NVidia Quadro.
[14:20] <cfhowlett> !flavors | iamrohit7
[14:20] <ubottu> iamrohit7: !Ubuntu-GNOME, !Kubuntu, !Xubuntu and !Lubuntu are simply flavors of Ubuntu that come with GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and LXDE (respectively) installed as default, instead of Unity. Other specialized flavors of Ubuntu include !Edubuntu, Ubuntu !Studio, and !Mythbuntu.
[14:20] <hateball> C_minus: For nvidia there are ways to prevent tearing globally, see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA#Avoid_tearing_with_GeForce_500.2F600.2F700.2F900_series_cards
[14:20] <iamrohit7> lotuspsychje: i currently use ubuntu. i want to switch. and then there are all those problems.
[14:20] <hateball> C_minus: But if you're using optimus so the intel card is used.... I am not sure how you set that up
[14:21] <lotuspsychje> iamrohit7: if you have troubles on ubuntu desktop, come to us
[14:21] <C_minus> i don't have the NVidia prime, nor the Bumblebee thing whatever. So I'm not sure how my computer is sharing out the workload to my GPUs...

[14:52] <Che-Anarc> Hi I'm trying to use `aptitude -r -y -f install _software_` to resolve unmet decencies as part of a script.... but the the recommended resolution is not actually done post `Keep the following.... No packages will be installed.`
[14:52] <Che-Anarc> Is it something I'm doing wrong?
[14:55] <daftykins> why use aptitude since it doesn't come with a default install?
[14:55] <daftykins> are you expecting users to install it before running your script?
[14:55] <thebwt> Howdy folks, is there a document out there that details packaging destination directory best practices?  like when to use /sbin vs /usr/sbin ?
[14:56] <cfhowlett> thebwt, I've only ever seen one with suggested "best practice".  I suspect #ubuntu-server would have the lin,
[14:56] <cfhowlett> link
[14:56] <thebwt> thanks cfhowlett

[14:56] <Che-Anarc> daftykins - its there as part of my current image... just having issue with getting `Y` as per manual process which works to also work from cli.

[14:56] <mcphail> thebwt: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard
[14:57] <thebwt> mcphail: I know about that one, was more curious about ubuntu specific best practicies
[14:57] <mcphail> thebwt: Ubuntu tends to stick to the FHS
[14:57] <thebwt> though they should be similar :)
[14:57] <thebwt> roger
[14:58] <OerHeks> Che-Anarc, in that aptitude line, what software are you trying to install ? hard to give answer in this hypothetical question
[15:00] <mcphail> thebwt: basically, if a binary might be needed before disks are mounted it has to go in /bin or /sbin. If it can wait for disk mounting, it goes in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin (if provided by the package manager) or /usr/local/bin (if provided by the user self-installing)
[15:00] <elysium_> exit
[15:00] <Che-Anarc> Orphis, ```aptitude -q -r -f -y install libperl5.14 libsnmp15```

[15:03] <Che-Anarc> SchrodingersScat,  is that an OSX device your trying to do it from out of interest?
[15:03] <SchrodingersScat> Che-Anarc: no, both are ubuntu 15.04
[15:03] <OerHeks> Che-Anarc, -q & -y ? that bites AFAIK
[15:05] <Che-Anarc> OerHeks,   I tried it with simply `-y -r`  still the same it seems to take suggestion but doesnt do / take its course of action.

[15:07] <SchrodingersScat> after the long hang, it gave this error, "ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer"
[15:07] <thebwt> SchrodingersScat: can the remote server 'ssh localhost' well?
[15:07] <thebwt> that's a timeout and typically a firewall thing
[15:08] <thebwt> if it's can ssh localhost, and then ssh <public IP>, then we know the ssh server is runnign fine and that it's a network thing
[15:11] <SchrodingersScat> thebwt: I'm using -R 7667:localhost:22 from the server, then on the publicly reachable machine ssh -p 7667 user@localhost  and sometimes it seems to connect, others it has issues :/

[15:18] <daftykins> regum: step 1, would be to pop to #ubuntu-arm - but likely i would've thought Pis get disk images you dd onto an SD card?
[15:20] <regum> yes, I burned the image into a microsd

[15:23] <regum> exactly
[15:23] <coy_> hi
[15:23] <daftykins> regum: ok, edit the boot parameter to have "text" instead of where it says "quiet splash"
[15:24] <regum> daftykins,  where is the boot parameter?
[15:24] <amanata> hi :)
[15:24] <daftykins> regum: you can either boot as normal and edit the config, or if you are attaching a mouse and keyboard, holding left shift at startup should give GRUB
[15:25] <ytixdecaf> Has anyone tried installing Aurous in Ubuntu?
[15:25] <regum> daftykins, I dont have GRUB
[15:25] <daftykins> regum: you won't see it as standard with normal boot processes, but it's likely there regardless.
[15:25] <a1_> hi i've installed raid 1 ubuntu server according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID

[15:25] <a1_> how do i check if it installed correctly
[15:26] <a1_> in raid 1 2 harddrives
[15:26] <daftykins> regum: ah, this justifies asking in #ubuntu-arm then :) perhaps getting a server image would make more sense also
[15:27] <regum> it's the only image that sofar works for what I need
[15:27] <regum> :/
[15:27] <daftykins> well, ask the right people and you might get a good reply ;)

[15:28] <DWSR> Is there a way to compress data from stdin via tar?

[15:29] <regum> daftykins, thanks, but I think I've got it
[15:29] <regum> daftykins, if you're interested, adding 'single' to the kernel parameters did it
[15:30] <a1_> does installation take twice as long since your write to 2 hardrives
[15:30] <a1_> ?
[15:30] <mcphail> DWSR: tar doesn't compress. But you can pipe teh output of dd through bzip2 or gzip
[15:30] <daftykins> regum: and you gained access to change that via editing /etc/default/grub or...?
[15:30] <daftykins> a1_: no
[15:30] <ruind> Did this change recently?  Failed to fetch http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/partner/binary-amd64/Packages  Hash Sum mismatch
[15:30] <daftykins> a1_: depends whether you did RAID-0 or RAID-1 also
[15:30] <DWSR> mcphail: I know that it doesn't, but I want a compressed tarball because reasons.
[15:30] <a1_> raid 1
[15:30] <a1_> mirrored
[15:31] <regum> daftykins, no, just editting /boot/cmdline.txt
[15:31] <a1_> there doesnt seem to be a straight forward way of putting zfs on ubuntu 14.04
[15:31] <daftykins> regum: ah yeah the Pis do things by text file, of course :)
[15:31] <DWSR> a1_: zfsonlinux, or linux-zfs.
[15:31] <regum> daftykins, thank you nevertheless
[15:31] <regum> bye!
[15:31] <daftykins> a1_: well it'd not be appropriate for ubuntu nor two disk only

[18:03] <bazhang> !java | tuelho
[18:03] <ubottu> tuelho: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.

[18:19] <erkburgles> where did you see that that had happened?
[18:19] <sortkwik> Well there's not much to tell. When I use the normal GUI shudown, it takes around 20 minutes to shutdown. When I use terminal and shutdown through there, it's immediate. Any insight or suggestions on why this is so?
[18:19] <erkburgles> or "we"
[18:21] <k1l> erkburgles: look at the error when trying to install postgresql: something like "could not lock file...."
[18:21] <sortkwik> bazhang: would the shutdown command be routed differently from command prompt to the graphical shutdown?
[18:22] <EriC^^> sortkwik: yeah
[18:23] <sortkwik> Eric^^: so if this is the case, why does shutting it down graphically take so long?
[18:23] <EriC^^> i have no idea
[18:23] <sortkwik> Eric^^: is there somewhere I can look or modify to do this?
[18:23] <sortkwik> Hmmm...
[18:23] <EriC^^> when you mean it takes long, do you mean after the ubuntu logo and dots come?
[18:23] <EriC^^> or until they come?
[18:24] <sortkwik> It sits at the shutdown screen, for a long time. Like 20 minutes.
[18:24] <EriC^^> press esc and it should say what it's trying to do or waiting for
[18:24] <sortkwik> Tried that, nothing popped up.
[18:25] <EriC^^> it should show you a terminal

[18:31] <flab> OerHeks, hi. I don't want to install 15.10 this is not my computer so I want a LTS on it. The question is, will the kernel of 15.10 be backported to 14.04? (as the previous ones have been..)
[18:32] <OerHeks> flab, not sure it will, maybe someone else here knows?

[19:06] <EriC^^> sortkwik: ok
[19:07] <sortkwik> EriC^^: So I have no idea why it did it now. I've tried restarting many times and that's the fastest shutdown graphically. Was it due to the command you recommended me to put in??

[19:11] <OerHeks> vacho, so you want ssh login to an account you have no access to? that is called hacking?
[19:11] <vacho> OerHeks: I have root access.
[19:12] <OerHeks> vacho, why do you not have access to that account? that makes no sense.
[19:12] <cobradabest> wileee: Well, I'm kind of in a panic right now, I don't know why...
[19:14] <wileee> cobradabest, You will probably get this fixed, I would assume you still have other desktops; which give you some time to follow the right lead.
[19:16] <cobradabest> wileee: I hope so. Do you have any suggestions on what to try to fix it?
[19:17] <wileee> cobradabest, Not really, other than if you're sure it is a ppa cinnamon, contact them is our standard response.
[19:18] <wileee> and sure it is that desktops issue

[19:25] <doomlord> can any spin of ubuntu with its' desktop environment do this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMsqA4k0J34
[19:25] <doomlord> very similar to the way desktops work on mac OSX; microsoft have copied it. i was under the impression linux worked differently to avoid legal issues
[19:25] <OerHeks> doomlord, maybe/maybe not, how should we know?
[19:26] <k1l> doomlord: virtual desktops have been on linux desktops since very long time
[19:26] <doomlord> yes they have
[19:27] <doomlord> and the feature has been evolved. I've seen expo/scale.
[19:27] <k1l> doomlord: is there any specific support issue? for general talk please join the #ubuntu-offtopic channel
[19:27] <doomlord> wheres' a good place for this question
[19:29] <Pici> doomlord: whats the question?
[19:30] <doomlord> is there a way to get this specific behaviour in ubuntu. (the desktop overview seen in OSX mission control and now windows 10). .. amongst the various array of plugins and desktop environments
[19:31] <Pici> doomlord: compiz has been able to do that for a few years now/
[19:31] <doomlord> i've seen expo and scale - is that what you're talking about
[19:32] <Pici> doomlord: there are a number of compiz plugins, of which those are two.
[19:32] <Pici> doomlord: the folks in #compiz might be able to suggest which ones will give you functionality like that
[19:32] <doomlord> (so has someone written a plugin that does this: simultaneously show desktop thumbnails *and* current desktop windows)
[19:33] <Pici> I don't know, I don't use a desktop regularly, but the #compiz people would be the ones most familiar with their plugin offerings
[19:33] <doomlord> the point is the overview in mission-control and OSX combines desktop&window overview in one screen
[19:33] <doomlord> ok
[19:33] <doomlord> the second question is:
[19:34] <cobradabest> Does anybody know a way to do system restore points on Ubuntu?
[19:34] <cobradabest> Systemback doesn't work properly for me.
[19:34] <doomlord> Do legal issues prevent the linux community sharing such a plugin?  I assumed thats' why it never appeared before. Seeing Win10 now questions that view.
[19:34] <Pici> doomlord: I would doubt it.

[19:36] <zerowaitstate> doomlord: it's possible there's a cross-licensing agreement that lets them do things another party wouldn't be able to. Software patents are dumb to start with, so trying to work out logically why a particular patent applies is the path to madness
[19:36] <cobradabest> So does anyone know a good restore point program for ubuntu?
[19:37] <doomlord> zerowaitstate thanks .
[19:37] <zerowaitstate> cobradabest: LVM snapshotting?
[19:37] <mcphail> cobradabest: are you using btrfs?
[19:37] <k1l> doomlord: the compiz plugin is called window spread
[19:37] <cobradabest> zerowaitstate: Well, whatever the equivalent to windows system restore is.
[19:38] <zerowaitstate> cobradabest: windows system restore doesn't really do what it advertises
[19:38] <cobradabest> zerowaitstate: Well it's always worked for me...
[19:39] <zerowaitstate> cobradabest: you've been fortunate
[19:39] <k1l> doomlord: press super+w or super+shift+w
[19:39] <mcphail> cobradabest: if you use btrfs, you can snapshot your filesystem at any point. If you don't use btrfs you will need to use something like LVM
[19:39] <cobradabest> mcphail: I don't know what btrfs or lvm are...
[19:41] <doomlord> k1l i've seen that and its' related, but last time I tried it it wasn't the specific behavior i'm after - unless its' gained options lately.   In ubuntu unity out of the box, you had super+W for windows, or super+S for desktops. The beauty of OSX is its' one shortcut for both, and you can move windows between desktops on that, and slide between them
[19:41] <TR3M3R3> hi everyone... somebody speak spanish?
[19:41] <mcphail> cobradabest: then you are probably not using them :) Btrfs is a filesystem you can use instead of the default (ext4). LVM is a technology for managing partitions and filesystems which you set up at install time
[19:41] <Pici> !es | TR3M3R3
[19:41] <ubottu> TR3M3R3: En la mayoría de los canales de Ubuntu, se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español entre al canal #ubuntu-es; escriba " /join #ubuntu-es " (sin comillas) y presione intro.
[19:42] <Piperanci> Helloo
[19:42] <cobradabest> mcphail: Oh, okay, so if I reinstall, I could choose btrfs instead of ext4?
[19:42] <mcphail> cobradabest: if you want to be able to simply snapshot your filesystem, it is a good choice. But it is not as well tested as ext4
[19:43] <Piperanci> I have an app running but it's not showing in the panel, just in the task manager. What can I do?
[19:43] <k1l> doomlord: well, you can still move the apps on ctrl+s
[19:43] <mcphail> cobradabest: personally, I think the advantages outweigh the risks, but you may disagree
[19:44] <cobradabest> mcphail: It sounds like a better idea, at least I can do risky stuff on btrfs.
[19:44] <doomlord> k1l i realise its' "useable", it certainly isn't 'bad'. I just have a very specific preference and would be surprised if I was unique in that
[19:45] <Piperanci> nvm I opened it somehow
[19:45] <mcphail> cobradabest: there are a few apps which will automatically make snapshots on btrfs when you use the package manager etc, but I have never found them to be much use. I create the snapshots manually as I need them
[19:45] <doomlord> k1l recently in linux I have used XFCE/xbuntu more, sticking with a simpler environment... but I also enjoy using the mac
[19:46] <k1l> doomlord: there is a huge amount of users that have never used OSX before. so they might not be used to that like you are.
=== HarryCross_ is now known as HarryCross
[19:46] <cobradabest> mcphail: Can you make schedules for backups?
[19:47] <mcphail> cobradabest: you can make schedules from crontab, if you wish
[19:47] <mcphail> cobradabest: these are not "backups", though. They are "snapshots"
[19:47] <k1l> doomlord: so "it needs to be exactly like OSX" is not what most users or developers might think in the first place.
[19:48] <MonkeyDust> doomlord  only OSX is exactly like OSX
[19:48] <doomlord> k1l whilst I'm no mac fanboy, in this instance I think apple got it right. v1 of mission control was terrible but v2 fixed it (app bundles).  Windows10 seems to have copied the behaviour. Whats so good about it is you get an overview of everything, but with recent windows larger , and older ones (on other desktops) smaller; its not eye-candy - the information is readable
[19:49] <doomlord> MonkeyDust oh sure - i'm not after the specific *look*, but the specific *behaviour* i.e. what information is visible at one time, and the transitions
[19:49] <SchrodingersScat> Che-Anarc: -o ServerAliveInterval=2 -o ServerAliveCountMax=1 had no effect
[19:49] <doomlord> Windows10 replicates that, but with a windows 'look' rather than an apple 'look' (and slightly different  options)
[19:50] <k1l> doomlord: well, than suggest bugfixes or whishes to the desktop enviroments. but it might not be seen like you do from other users/devs
[19:51] <jancoow> Hi guys
[19:51] <doomlord> i'd be very surprised if no one else wants it. I had assumed legal issues prevented it
[19:51] <jancoow> Could someone help me fixing broken packages? For some reason python3 wouldn't update. With some tricks here i had to downgrade some packages. But now the module threading doesn't exist
[19:52] <jancoow> I really need python3 but i can
[19:52] <OerHeks> doomlord, if the behaviour is exactly the same, we would have legal issues. a 'start' button is very expensive
[19:52] <jancoow> 't do anything with it if the module threading is missing
=== jhutchin1 is now known as jhutchins_wk
[19:52] <doomlord> OerHeks intersting, you seem to have speciic information there, "a start button"
[19:53] <doomlord> there's a specific patent for that?
[19:53] <OerHeks> just an example.
[19:53] <OerHeks> doomlord, sure, google for that, i don't have an url ready
[19:53] <doomlord> gnome-shell almost does what I want - but I find it offputing in other ways (to date, xubuntu/xfce is my favourite environemnt in linux)

[20:00] <shokkonut> salve
[20:01] <balance> how can I check a png for an alpha channel using terminal?
[20:01] <apatheticsheep> howdy, anyone know if byobu is supposed to work in like teraterm or putty?
[20:02] <MonkeyDust> apatheticsheep  byobu is a layer over screen multiplexer
[20:03] <MonkeyDust> !info byobu
[20:03] <ubottu> byobu (source: byobu): text window manager, shell multiplexer, integrated DevOps environment. In component main, is optional. Version 5.92-0ubuntu1 (vivid), package size 102 kB, installed size 641 kB
[20:03] <MonkeyDust> apatheticsheep  putty is a windows program to connect over ssh
[20:03] <apatheticsheep> ok ... let me clarify, it's not recognizing function keys.  I am guessing that has more to do with my terminal software settings than the program i am using.
[20:04] <MonkeyDust> apatheticsheep  true, byobu has its own key settings... for that reason I cannot use it for irssi
[20:05] <apatheticsheep> MonkeyDust I know what putty and byobu are ...
[20:05] <MonkeyDust> apatheticsheep  then you should know that you were comparing apples with pears
[20:07] <apatheticsheep> i guess a better way to phrase the question would've been ... why can't I create a new window using F2 or access help (shift+f1) in a putty ssh terminal using byobu?
[20:09] <apatheticsheep> I can use screen ...
[20:10] <zerowaitstate> apatheticsheep: probably the terminal emulation you have selected in putty
[20:10] <sortkwik> Hmmm... so there is a new version of a program called octave, when I apt-get it it installs v3.8.2 but v4.0.0 is available according to the website. What repository do I need to update in order to get this newer version??
[20:10] <SchrodingersScat> Che-Anarc: heh, and then it randomly worked just now, without those -o options, my reverse tunnel threw these errors on the server, Warning: remote port forwarding failed for listen port 60111, Warning: remote port forwarding failed for listen port 7667;  7667 is the one I forward, should I also forward the 60111?

[20:11] <MonkeyDust> sortkwik  v4.0 is not yet in the repos, maybe in a later ubuntu release
[20:11] <SchrodingersScat> sortkwik: right, would have to go outside the scope of this help for that, ie whatever they recommend, if you want the version not in ubuntu
[20:12] <apatheticsheep> zerowaitstate ... I am using vt100
[20:12] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: If you need bleeding edge I would either check for a ppa, or build from source and use checkinstall to generate a machine-specific package
[20:12] <Guest34450> How can I write to files, example: sudo "x" >> /etc/rc.local
[20:12] <sortkwik> I gotcha. I guess I would need to learn how to compile then?? I've downloaded the tarball for it from their website.
[20:12] <Guest34450> I try to do that and get: bash: /etc/rc.local: Permission denied
[20:12] <zerowaitstate> apatheticsheep: I think there's another emulation type called Linux, did you try that?
[20:13] <Guest34450> How can I write to files, example: sudo "x" >> /etc/rc.local

[20:14] <Guest34450> MonkeyDust, I tried echo both with and without sudo in front and still get Permission denied
[20:15] <MonkeyDust> Guest34450  look what k1l said
[20:15] <mcphail> Guest34450: the "sudo" does not carry beyond the redirect, so that is to be expected
[20:15] <Guest34450> k1l, so how can I write to those files using command line (I can vim into the file and edit it, but I am trying to write script to update some settings)
[20:16] <mcphail> Guest34450: see http://superuser.com/questions/136646/how-to-append-to-a-file-as-sudo
[20:16] <k1l> Guest34450: echo "hello" | sudo tee foo.txt
[20:16] <balance> why can I see a folder via terminal but not from emacs?
[20:16] <balance> *i mean kate
[20:17] <zerowaitstate> k1l: he needs a -a on the tee command, in order to append
[20:17] <k1l> Guest34450: right, you need "-a" for tee to append. i forgot that
[20:18] <job-home> hi
[20:18] <daftykins> hi
[20:18] <k1l> zerowaitstate: thanks
[20:19] <Guest34450> k1l, thanks that did the trick, thanks man!
[20:21] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: cd to untarred source tree, "sudo auto-apt run ./configure", then do "make && sudo checkinstall". That helps deal with the dependency hell that comes with building C stuff from source.
[20:22] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: before that will work though, you need to "sudo apt-get install auto-apt build-essential checkinstall"
[20:22] <sortkwik> zerowaitstate: so run "checkinstall" after I run "make"?
[20:22] <sortkwik> Got it
[20:22] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: then "sudo auto-apt update && sudo auto-apt updatedb && sudo auto-apt update-local"
[20:22] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: then do the cd to untarred...
[20:24] <sortkwik> zerowaitstate: Already ran "./congifure" and now installing said programs you stated earlier then I will run "make" and then "checkinstall"
[20:24] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: so ./configure didn't produce errors?
[20:24] <sortkwik> zerowaitstate: None
[20:25] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: k. usually when compiling from source on debian, you often are missing "-dev" packages, which contain the header files (.h) for libraries you are compiling against
[20:25] <sortkwik> This will be my first compiled program from source code, I'm excited.
[20:25] <dickGraySon> so what is this about
[20:25] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: auto-apt is designed to automatically fetch the necessary -dev packages during the ./configure step
[20:26] <sortkwik> zerowaitstate: We'll see how it pans out and go from there. Would the errors have been glaring in all the scrolling text? I didn't see anything.
[20:26] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: however, if ./configure isn't producing errors, then means auto-apt isn't necessary
[20:26] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: yeah, it will fail loudly
[20:26] <dickGraySon> \r
[20:26] <SpyderSnake> ciao
[20:26] <sortkwik> zerowaitstate: Awesome, no loud fails then.

[20:27] <gull> Hi guy, i've got some really annoying (not)bug happening to my laptop.
[20:27] <gull> i have a xmodmap config file which i use to redefine some buttons, but when i replug my usb mouse it looks like xmodmad reserts its config, so i have to run it again with my own config
[20:28] <gull> what exactly happens when i plug my usb mouse?
[20:28] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: on a generic linux system, make install directly copies the necessary files to the default install location (this is normally set up by configure, and it is normally under /usr/local by default). However, checkinstall analyzes the locations where the "make install" script is trying to copy stuff and instead makes a .deb package out of it
[20:28] <dickGraySon> remote command via ssh in background?
[20:28] <k1l> dickGraySon: use screen
[20:28] <Pici> or tmux
[20:29] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: if you don't use checkinstall, and do it the generic linux way, you have to keep the source around, so you can run "make uninstall" later to remove the software. the deb package makes that unnecessary, as you can use dpkg or other tools to remove it
[20:29] <brother_> hi all, somebody help me doing this from command line
[20:29] <brother_> I want to replace multiple empty lines with just one blank line, recursively in all the files in a directory, and they have to keep their filenames
[20:29] <sortkwik> zerowaitstate: That makes sense, sort of. Still a bit of a newb at this but we're all here to learn!!
[20:29] <reisio> brother_: what's the one blank line for?
[20:30] <sortkwik> Slow mo compiling right now. I don't have a super speedy machine. (=
[20:30] <brother_> reisio to keep it organized
[20:30] <brother_> not to remove them all
[20:30] <dickGraySon> @
[20:31] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: as I learned on freenode a day or two ago, you can apparently do something like "make -j 2" to run multiple build tasks in parallel, but you have to be careful when you use it
[20:31] <reisio> brother_: uniq would do it, though it'd also remove other duplicate consecutive lines
[20:31] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: compiling is CPU bound, so the more cores you can use, the faster you will get done
[20:31] <reisio> brother_: another way: perl -0pe 's/\n\n+/\n\n/g'
[20:32] <brother_> aha reisio, and how can I apply that to all the files in the directory, and they keep their original name after the removal of the blank lines?
[20:34] <reisio> brother_: how big are these files?
[20:35] <sortkwik> zerowaitstate: Yeah, I have 4 cores but not a super speedy cores. toshiba satellite radius 11
[20:35] <reisio> brother_: I'd probably do something like: mkdir ../cleaned; ls | while IFS='' read -r item; do uniq "$item" > ../cleaned/"$item"; done
[20:35] <brother_> reisio they vary from 4 KB to 150 KB in some cases, but norm is 30 kb let's say
[20:35] <reisio> brother_: okay, so tiny
[20:35] <sortkwik> zerowaitstate: My monitor shows all 4 cores are chugging away.
[20:35] <s1dr0> hola a toc from italy
[20:35] <reisio> brother_: fine to make a duplicated 'cleaned' dir, then
[20:35] <zerowaitstate> sortkwik: well, never mind then
[20:35] <reisio> if they were huge files, you'd have to modify them and delete the original basically simultaneously, which you have to be more careful about
[20:35] <reisio> copying to another dir is simpler, and requires less care :)
[20:36] <reisio> brother_: what's nice about that loop is you just make the ls output what you want, if there are exceptions
[20:36] <reisio> brother_: so "ls | while IFS=''..." could be instead "ls | egrep -iv 'not wanted|also not wanted' | while IFS=''..."
[20:37] <reisio> lots of other ways you could do it, though
[20:37] <sortkwik> zerowaitstate: Yeah, I am not going to try any parallel builds.
[20:40] <brother_> reisio but in that expresion, where do you refer to the files inside the directory?
[20:40] <reisio> brother_: 'ls'
[20:40] <reisio> you'd run it from in the dir
[20:41] <reisio> if the output of 'ls' is all the files you want to process, and nothing more, then it's good to go
[20:41] <reisio> mkdir ../cleaned; ls | while IFS='' read -r item; do uniq "$item" > ../cleaned/"$item"; done

[20:46] <reisio> gull: ?
[20:46] <gull> reisio: my xmodmap resets my custom setting to default

[21:09] <k1l> regum: can you give more details?
[21:10] <regum> yeah
[21:10] <regum> I have a raspberry pi 2, and it boots as root

[21:10] <regum> it says 'connection refused'
[21:10] <blakdog> Do the ubuntu lts versions able to run as a live cd ?

[21:14] <k1l> regum: welcome to irc
[21:14] <daftykins> regum: so to be sure, you're ssh'ing as username@host when you try after the Pi boots up?
[21:15] <regum> no, just ssh hostname
[21:15] <regum> the users have the same name
[21:15] <regum> that way it's less of a hassle
[21:15] <daftykins> ok so it's not trying root@ to begin with, that's good
[21:16] <daftykins> it's possible SSHd isn't even running until your user logs in then
[21:16] <regum> is there any way i can set it up so that it logs into my user at boot time?
[21:16] <regum> yeah, it's probably something like that
[21:16] <regum> because after I log in it works perfectly
[21:16] <bekks> regum: Ensure your raspi isnt in sleep mode or something, and wakes up only upon the user logging in.
[21:16] <k1l> regum: is it encrypted?
[21:17] <regum> it isn't encrypted
[21:17] <regum> and it isn0t in sleep mode
[21:17] <bekks> How do you know, if you arent logged in? :)
[21:17] <regum> I can work on it as root without logging in if it's connected to a display
[21:17] <regum> I connected a display before to check
[21:17] <daftykins> check SSHd is configured to run at boot
[21:17] <bekks> ah :)
[21:17] <regum> that's how I know
[21:18] <regum> how can I check that?
[21:18] <k1l> i still dont understand what the issue is
[21:18] <daftykins> don't know.
[21:18] <daftykins> it's a weird Pi image for ARM so all of my usual bets are off
[21:18] <daftykins> what about that boot text file from last time?
[21:18] <regum> k1l, my pi boots as root, and it refuses ssh connection until i log into it from the same pi
[21:18] <daftykins> does it mention SSHd?
[21:19] <k1l> regum: no. it boots as nothing.
[21:19] <regum> i don't think it did
[21:19] <regum> I'll check
[21:20] <k1l> regum: seems you are mixing loging in and the base system running.
[21:20] <regum> dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait single
[21:20] <regum> this is what it says
[21:20] <bindi> Can anyone point me to an up to date guide for running a program (irssi) in a jail?
[21:20] <jancoow> daftyskins: well that's the problem, no errors lol
[21:21] <regum> I just added 'single' to that file, so that it wouldn't start the gui

[21:21] <jancoow> daftyskins: but i can't use pip3 or easy install because all of these packages are using threading and i have NO idea why this package is gone
[21:21] <daftykins> jancoow: i wonder if this is the bad build i heard about on the bug site
[21:21] <jancoow> yes it is
[21:21] <daftykins> and that bug doesn't have an answer yet?
[21:21] <regum> can't I add some sort of script at boot time that inputs 3 commands?
[21:21] <regum> exit
[21:21] <regum> username
[21:21] <regum> passwrd
[21:22] <regum> that logs me in
[21:22] <daftykins> not really.
[21:22] <k1l> regum: well, you boot into single user mode then. that is not loading the regular system then
[21:22] <k1l> regum: so better use text.
[21:22] <daftykins> ah yeah regum did that yesterday
[21:22] <jancoow> last time i asked it here also because "python.h" was missing. Then someone helped me downgrading some stuff to get it extally updated. Since then the module threading is missing for some reason
[21:22] <daftykins> i did suggest text but you did single instead, mmm
[21:22] <daftykins> so there you go.
[21:22] <daftykins> k1l: good catch!
[21:22] <regum> but i can't use grubs
[21:22] <regum> that's why
[21:23] <daftykins> put text into the boot text file instead
[21:23] <k1l> regum: so there you need to talk to the guys that made that image
[21:23] <Silentloud> how do i enable firewall
[21:23] <regum> the image boots into text
=== roo_ is now known as roo
[21:23] <daftykins> !ufw | Silentloud
[21:23] <ubottu> Silentloud: Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has built-in firewall capabilities. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | GUI frontends such as gufw and ufw-kde also exist. | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo
