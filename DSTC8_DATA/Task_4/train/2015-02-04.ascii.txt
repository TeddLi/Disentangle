[05:08] <ame> ubottu:which one is better??IS it ACL or using chmod??
[05:09] <ame> ubottu:I know clearly to apply permission using ACL
[05:09] <ubottu> ame: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[05:09] <bongfun> Bashing-om: why is there no usr/bin on Lubuntu??
[05:09] <PSGroup41> The file name is test.csh it contains two lines: 1) #!/bin/csh 2)echo first argument is $1
[05:10] <ame> which one is better??IS it ACL or using chmod??I know clearly to apply permission using ACL
[05:10] <PSGroup41> I ran it the file withe command, source test.csh abc.
[05:11] <Bashing-om> bongfun: It be /usr/bin .. there sure better be ... else system no workie .
[05:11] <somsip> PSGroup41: that's not what source is for. you should chmod +x test.csh, then run it with ./test.csh abc
[05:12] <Bashing-om> ame: Best I can tell you, each has it's place and proper usage .
[05:12] <PSGroup41> I did chmod +x test.csh.
[05:12] <somsip> PSGroup41: and then you ran it with source, which is wrong
[05:14] <wsky> what would be the reason that /etc/init.d/networking fails to start?
[05:14] <somsip> PSGroup41: just tested it myself (in bash) and it worked as you want it to. So do it the right way and then report back
[05:14] <PSGroup41> I ran ./test.csh abc and the output was fine. i ran it with source and I did not see the abc as output.
[05:14] <kinle> hi
[05:14] <somsip> PSGroup41: because source doesn't work like that. Why do you want/need to use source? What is the end result you want?
[05:15] <ame> Bashing-om:good answer...Everything has a place to use...
[05:16] <PSGroup41> I would like the output as: first argument is abc. Right now, I am seeing: first argument is.
[05:16] <ame> Do anybody have idea on webserver??
[05:16] <somsip> PSGroup41: read this. http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5024/passing-a-variable-to-a-bash-script-when-sourcing-it-in-another-bash-script And I'm AFK now

[05:28] <dingus1> It works fine. it only has a floppy drive and a CD drive
[05:29] <PSGroup41> So source will not take the first argument. How to make it take the argument?
[05:29] <dingus1> ubuntu 14.10 was to big to put on a CD. so I created a bootable usb stick.
[05:29] <dingus1> today I want to create a backup of the system that will boot from a USB stick.
[05:30] <dingus1> hmm, system back does not seem to work in 14.10
[05:30] <PSGroup41> The system needs to upgrade?
[05:30] <ame> Any idea on how to set the cron job for this command "gksu deja-dup-preferences"
[05:31] <wsky> why would my network-manager not start automatically? when i boot i get "Waiting for network configuration" message and it doe not work after boot untill i start nm manually
[05:31] <dingus1> tried using timeshift, but it is not clear how to install the snapshot onto a USB stick. any help?

[05:34] <RICHARD_CHEN> hello everyone
[05:36] <neosiu> hello guys, i have a question: is ubuntu more advanced than windows? and mac os?
[05:36] <mehdi__> hey guys what is the lowest version of the linux kernel  in LTS ?
[05:37] <PSGroup41> So how do I let the cshell script to take the argument?
[05:37] <neosiu> as windows 10 's coming soon at the mean time free
[05:37] <wsky> ok so /etc/init.d/networking is not suported anymore
[05:38] <wsky> so why would my network-manager fail to start?
[05:38] <wsky> i can run it manually
[05:39] <mehdi__> wsky, i guess you can restart it visually
[05:39] <wsky> mehdi__: what?
[05:40] <Bray90820> So i am here on an ubuntu desktop but it's thinks i'm on a battery
[05:41] <mehdi__> wsky,  i mean you can use your mouse to hover over the network manager on the panel disconnect/reconnect
[05:41] <wsky> dude, do you have any clue what i'm talking about?
[05:42] <neosiu> bray90820: battery mode?
[05:42] <mehdi__> you want to restart your networking service arent you?
[05:42] <wsky> no. i want the networking to start properly during the bootup
[05:42] <wsky> i can start the network-manager manually but it does not start at boot
[05:42] <ame> how to set the cron job for this command "gksu deja-dup-preferences"
[05:43] <Bray90820> neosiu: It shows the batter icon in the menubar like it does on a laptop
[05:43] <mehdi__> wsky, check update.rc-d to see if your networking service is available there or not
[05:44] <wsky> mehdi__: stop talking to me
[05:44] <wsky> you're clueless

[05:55] <ForSpareParts> subcool: Whats happening?
[05:55] <subcool> every way i try to format. it errors
[05:55] <subcool> Windows, gnome disk, TWRP with my Tablet
[05:56] <ForSpareParts> what error?
[05:57] <subcool> depends on which program. Trying to use Gnome with the gui, it doesnt tell me much
[05:57] <aeon-ltd> subcool: what does it say?

[06:01] <subcool> i googled it, but im not getting much.
[06:02] <wsky> anyways, i vound what the issue was
[06:04] <subcool> i know this is suppsoed to be simple, but... its not that simple.
[06:05] <aeon-ltd> subcool: what live environment are you using to partition?
[06:05] <subcool> kubuntu
[06:05] <dingus1> subcool, what version of windows did you try?
[06:05] <subcool> win8 with disk manager
[06:06] <aeon-ltd> subcool: is this a recent version?
[06:06] <subcool> 14.04
[06:06] <dingus1> I had a similar problem and was able to use the disk manager in win vista. it worked fine.
[06:06] <subcool> ive tried some SD formatter
[06:06] <subcool> a few things, i havent used CLI and fdisk
[06:07] <dingus1> boot 14.04 to a system prompt then run fdisk
[06:07] <subcool> It belongs in my tablet, but it has some kinda write and format issues. So itll copy or detete what i say, but on reboot, it all goes back to previous state
[06:07] <subcool> im a lil sloppy with fdisk..
[06:08] <subcool> i retract that- i dont know what im doing. whats a good command?
[06:08] <subcool> heck i forgot how to cli most commands.

[06:29] <subcool>  peter100 yeah, but i run into every stupid issues kubuntu can throw
[06:29] <subcool> konsole, dmesg
[06:29] <subcool> ask them, i have to reboot
[06:30] <peter100> i face this issue randomly, like 1 out of 5 times
[06:30] <peter100> very random
[06:31] <peter100> and when this happens, even alt+ctrl+backspace doesn;t works
[06:31] <peter100> very strange
[06:31] <peter100> then i had  to manually reboot the pc
[06:33] <subcool> peter100, see what dmesg says, is it one usb drive or every?
[06:33] <subcool> could just be a bug and the kernel panics - its so hard to say without an error

[06:34] <akis>  hi all. i recently realized that xfburn cannot write all files (ie because long files name or invalid characters) without any previous warning about that. On K3b has the same behavior but there is a special warning which files should be renamed. is there any option for xfburn too or any other option to by-pass this issue?
[06:34] <ThetaOrionis> Hello everyone. I have a little problem, I lost touch with UBuntu for quite a while, and now I can't get to connect Pidgin with Freenode. :\ Whatever ports I enter or use SSL, my account always fails to login to Freenode. Has the settings been changed?
[06:35] <peter100> akis brasero is nice
[06:38] <akis> peter100: will brassero give a warning for those files need to be renamed? does brassero fits on xubuntu without adding to many libraries?
[06:39] <jnhghy> I've just did the latest updates on my ubuntu 14.04 and then it asked me to reboot but now I get "Boot Error" how can I fix this?
[06:41] <peter100> akis not sure about if it gives any such warnings, but brasero is pretty good
[06:43] <peter100> brasero should work on xubuntu too, just check if  you have all necessary dependency files
[06:43] <peter100> brasero should be in xubuntu;s repository
[06:44] <akis> peter100: actually is very important for me to take this warning (as K3b does and xfburn doesn't) so i will have the option to rename the file because i proceed with burning.
[06:44] <peter100> akis i am not sure if brasero will give you any such warnings
[06:45] <peter100> and most of disc burning tools don;t support this feature
[06:45] <subcool> im back. ok. could someone please help me format this drive. its getting very frustrating
[06:45] <peter100> though they will verify data after completion of burning

[06:50] <subcool> just not allowing me to do anything, i hope the drive isnt corrupted.. but i dont know how to determine that
[06:51] <peter100> an adapter works best

[06:59] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: is that an optimus card?
[06:59] <rizmut_> how can i now lotuspsychje?
[06:59] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: check official website for your card
[06:59] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: it should mention optimus technology somewhere
[07:00] <rizmut_> oh
[07:00] <rizmut_> i have checked and downloaded the official driver
[07:01] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: so is it an optimus?
[07:01] <rizmut_> the site direct me to download NVIDIA 346.35 version
[07:01] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: its best to use the drivers ubuntu suggests first
[07:01] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: ubuntu version?
[07:02] <rizmut_> 14.04.1
[07:02] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: did you install ubuntu with internet enabled and updates during setup?
[07:03] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje:i've checked restricted drivers tab in software-properties-gtk but nothing to do
[07:03] <Philiphsko> hi guys
[07:03] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: i mean ubuntu couldn't detect my nvidia card
[07:03] <Philiphsko> hii
[07:03] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: you didnt answer my question mate
[07:04] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje : but by terminal (i forget the command) system tell me to install 340.xx version
[07:04] <Philiphsko> i am fucking noob
[07:04] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: yes i install with internet enabled
[07:04] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: also updates enabled?
[07:04] <lotuspsychje> philipballew: please keep the language familly friendly here
[07:04] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: y
[07:05] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: its recomended to let ubuntu choose the right graphics driver
[07:05] <ItsMeLenny> hello, need a little help, i have followed every instructional i can find online, and i still can't get my android device to show up in ubuntu 14.04 (android 2.3.6)
[07:06] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: you can check your active driver with sudo lshw -C video
[07:06] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: it shows after the driver=
[07:07] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: yes, i have tried the same version from official site, but i've got the same bad result: my display going blank after plymouth boot
[07:07] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: the active driver is Intel Haswell Mobile
[07:07] <NoOova_> How to replace by regular expression in file?
[07:08] <NoOova_> Multiline
[07:08] <NoOova_> I have a log with XML chunks. i want to extract xml chunks
[07:08] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: thats your other onboard grafix active..
[07:08] <kk_> Need help to mount android phone on ubuntu console os. or without gvfs-mtp.
[07:08] <NoOova_> and add log record date to xml attribute
[07:08] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: yes, it's my onboard graphic card
[07:09] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: you enabled nvidia in bios?
[07:09] <lotuspsychje> !info mtpfs | kk_
[07:09] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: by default, my BIOS could not detect it
[07:09] <ubottu> kk_: mtpfs (source: mtpfs): FUSE filesystem for Media Transfer Protocol devices. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.1-5 (utopic), package size 15 kB, installed size 74 kB
[07:10] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: i could not find any string that tell 'nvidia' or something similar in BIOS
[07:11] <kk_> mtpfs takes too long for mounting device. And it is not showing current data, Means To get current data i need to remount it .
[07:11] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: i ve tried also xorg-edgers ppa, with both version (the site preferable 346.xx version and ubuntu terminal choice 340.xx version)
[07:11] <kk_> This problem is solved on gvfs
[07:12] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: you sure your card isnt an optimus???
[07:12] <xangua> kk_: what ubuntu release is this?
[07:12] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: 840m shows optimus on its site
[07:13] <kk_> 14.04
[07:13] <kk_> But i am using it in beaglebone
[07:14] <xangua> mtp should work with no issues in 14.04
[07:14] <kk_> yes it is working on desktop OS which has gnome support
[07:15] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: so?
[07:15] <kk_> i am using it in beaglebone and i have no destop. so can not use gvfs
[07:15] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: if your card is optimus, you need the package nvidia-prime..so make sure your card is optimus or not

[07:18] <rizmut_> lotuspsychje: how to check it?
[07:18] <lotuspsychje> rizmut_: the official website for your card, should mention features: optimus technology

[07:31] <rrr> how to create tar ball excluding .git folder?
[07:31] <lotuspsychje> kk_: most webpages mention other version of ubuntu then 14.04 for gvfs-mtp
[07:31] <lotuspsychje> kk_: is this a fresh 14.04 install?
[07:32] <kk_> yes
[07:34] <kk_> ubuntu 14.04 desktop OS has builtin mtp support. gvfs with nautilus provide that facility to automount mtp device
[07:34] <lotuspsychje> kk_: yes this sould work properly on trusty

[07:59] <crlcan81> I'm curious as to any good ideas for torrent clients besides Transmission. I've used Deluge, liked it, even liked the windows version because it's such a simple client that just does what you need, but I'm just wondering if there's any other preferences for those who have used Ubuntu more then I have.
[08:00] <cfhowlett> crlcan81, see the software center for the list of options.  the preference of others should be absolutely irrelevant to you as you're YOU.  Manage your system to your needs and preferences.

[08:14] <mitt> ItsMeLenny yer computer crashed or it simply cannot recognise Android?
[08:17] <ItsMeLenny> mitt, my computer crashed when i asked the question previously, i have since downgraded xorg so it should not crash again, but my computer cannot recognise android, or at least this device, and i only have the one device
[08:18] <mitt> ItsMeLenny, have ye tried looking for it mounted in /media/$user?
[08:19] <ItsMeLenny> mitt, not mounted in there, it isnt even recognised in lsusb, yet its charging off my computer
[08:19] <ItsMeLenny> i did have this phone working once before on 12.04
[08:19] <Ben64> ItsMeLenny: downgraded xorg? why? downgrading is not good
[08:19] <shaowhite> HIHI
[08:19] <shaowhite> ALL
[08:20] <shaowhite> How can i install KDE On 14.10?
[08:20] <ItsMeLenny> Ben64, because id upgraded it to an unstable version and it kept crashing my computer
[08:20] <Ben64> shaowhite: sudo apt-get install plasma-desktop
[08:21] <mitt> ItsMeLenny, my device for example mounts sometimes in /media/$user with nothing in /dev/usb0, though it's BlackBerry but the method is the same,
[08:22] <mitt> Does Android have something like USB mass storage?
[08:22] <Ben64> some do, otherwise it uses mtp or something like that
[08:23] <ItsMeLenny> mitt, ah, this hasnt mounted anywhere as far as i can see, and adb can't recognise it
[08:23] <Ben64> mounting and adb are completely different
[08:23] <ItsMeLenny> i just had an idea though
[08:23] <Ben64> you'll want #android for android support
[08:23] <ItsMeLenny> yes they are, still it doesnt show up anywhere
[08:24] <ItsMeLenny> well its ubuntu support as its android not showing in ubuntu
[08:24] <Tzunamii> ItsMeLenny: What does dmesg report when you plug it in?
[08:24] <mitt> I remember in Ubuntu I did need to install gMTP
[08:24] <Ben64> really seems like an android thing if you can't get adb working
[08:25] <ItsMeLenny> Tzunamii, whats the trick to getting dmesg to show me what i need to see
[08:25] <Ben64> type "dmesg" and look at the last few lines
[08:25] <ItsMeLenny> ah, nothing if that is the case
[08:26] <Tzunamii> ItsMeLenny: Pull the cable, wait 4 seconds and plug it back in and check dmesg agin
[08:27] <ItsMeLenny> still nothing
[08:27] <Ben64> does the usb port work
[08:27] <ItsMeLenny> all stuff about eth0
[08:27] <Tzunamii> Now that's bad
[08:27] <Tzunamii> Switch USB cable and/or the USB port and check again

=== med\ is now known as dem
[11:30] <beliali2> well the problem is that when i check the disk sizes with 'df' it shows my / partition as 14G (total) and 13G used. But when i go to / and run du -sh, it shows 7G
[11:30] <beliali2> so im missing like 6G somewhere
[11:31] <beliali2> and i cant figure out how and where to find it
[11:31] <lotuspsychje> beliali2: try df -h or install gparted
[11:31] <beliali2> yeah df -h thats what i meant
[11:31] <fa7ad> beliali2, yeah try using gparted
[11:32] <arcsky> fa7ad: ok how can i prevent this "*** System restart required ***" =
[11:32] <beliali2> gparted. alright, thats a lead, thanks!
[11:33] <fa7ad> arcsky, you can't. probably because of a kernel update
[11:33] <beliali2> I got those 'system restart required' almost after every security upgrade. even without kernel upgrade. i just ignore it unless i upgrade kernel tho.. :)
[11:34] <fa7ad> beliali2, tbh the only cli tool i used for partition is fdisk and mk*
[11:34] <arcsky> fa7ad: there must be a way to disable that line
[11:34] <beliali2> wait but gparted is a GUI based tool, right? My ubuntu doesnt have GUI

[11:41] <arcsky> sudo chmod -x /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-updates-available /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-reboot-required
[11:41]  * fa7ad is shaking his head
[11:43] <arcsky> ?
[11:43] <fa7ad> arcsky, not really a solution, rather a work-around. similar to what i do to disable os-prober in grub2
[11:44] <beliali2> does this explain anything?.. http://p.defau.lt/?E_MVpkaOLwrjjOHEQl8h0A I thought that parted 'print free' should show unallocated space too ?
[11:44] <fa7ad> arcsky, but why disable the update available message (/usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-updates-available). that comes handy unless of course you update regularly or using a cron
[11:45] <jose__> jo
[11:46] <arcsky> fa7ad: ok
[11:47] <arcsky> another question why does this message print out twice when i login to it the box ? http://pastebin.com/q4iu6VJh
[11:48] <fa7ad> there might be a duplicate in your motd or /etc/profile
[11:49] <knob> Good morning guys.  I am working with my Ubuntu machine, and a Nexus5 phone.  I currently have the program adb (for communication with Android devices).  I have adb version 1.0.31, yet I need 1.0.32.   I am not sure how to update it to the latest... ubuntu shows everything as updated.
[11:50] <knob> I added a repository that I *thought*  would have the latest, yet it still has 1.0.31
[11:50] <knob> Any idea how I can upgrade to adb 1.0.32
[11:50] <knob> ?
[11:51] <beliali2> Another question about partitions: lsof | grep '(deleted)' shows me lots of entries of files that are apparently deleted. Could this be the cause of du and df showing different results ?
[11:57] <lotuspsychje> !info android-tools-adb | knob is this what you need?
[11:57] <ubottu> knob is this what you need?: android-tools-adb (source: android-tools): Android Debug Bridge CLI tool. In component universe, is extra. Version 4.2.2+git20130218-3ubuntu36 (utopic), package size 67 kB, installed size 241 kB (Only available for linux-any)
[11:58] <knob> lotuspsychje, I believe so...   yet... I think it's running 1.0.31
[11:58] <knob> checking now
[11:58] <knob> Yeah.... it tells me I am already running the latest version
[11:58] <knob> and if I run adb version  ... it returns 1.0.31
[12:00] <lotuspsychje> knob: wich ubuntu version do you have
[12:00] <knob> 14.04 if I a not mistaken lotuspsychje
[12:00] <knob> confirming...
[12:01] <knob> lotuspsychje, 14.10
[12:01] <knob> just checked with lsb_release -a
[12:02] <beliali2> Ok so for anyone that wonders, df and du could show different disk size information due to deleted files still being used. lsof | grep deleted will show you the files.
[12:02] <beliali2> I have another question for ubuntu gurus :)
[12:03] <beliali2> every week i do apt-get update & upgrade to install the security updates
[12:03] <beliali2> at the end of it it always shows something like: The following packages have been kept back:   linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic
[12:03] <beliali2> Tell me, do you people constantly upgrade your ubuntu kernels?
[12:03] <beliali2> Im looking for stability over anything else
[12:04] <lotuspsychje> beliali2: maybe would be good to clean out old kernels
[12:04] <lotuspsychje> beliali2: try bleachbit to clean your system
[12:04] <k1l> !distupgrade | beliali2
[12:04] <ubottu> beliali2: A dist-upgrade will install new dependencies for packages already installed and may remove packages if they are no longer needed. This will not bring you to a new release of Ubuntu, see !upgrade if that is your intention.
[12:04] <beliali2> its not, i don't want to upgrade ubuntu
[12:04] <beliali2> i run 14.04.1 lts and i want to keep it that way for now
[12:04] <beliali2> my question is if I should keep upgrading my kernels
[12:05] <ObrienDave> 14.04.2 is available
[12:05] <beliali2> or should i stick with the one i have now?
[12:05] <k1l> beliali2: no read what it says. its not doing a 14.04 to 14.10 upgrade
[12:05] <beliali2> 3.13.0-39-generic is the kernel im using
[12:05] <beliali2> so doing a dist-upgrade is completely safe? dependancy wise?
[12:05] <k1l> beliali2: but for kernel updates it needs apt-get dist-upgrade because a kernel update needs to install new packages what apt-get upgrade cant do
[12:06] <k1l> i know its very silly of apt-get but its the way it was intended back then at debian
[12:07]  * ObrienDave ALWAYS uses dist-upgrade
[12:07] <Giwrgaras> anyone has a terminal display problem?
[12:07] <k1l> !details | Giwrgaras
[12:07] <ubottu> Giwrgaras: Please elaborate; your question or issue may not seem clear or detailed enough for people to help you. Please give more detailed information, errors, steps, and possibly configuration files (use the !pastebin to avoid flooding the channel)
[12:08] <Giwrgaras> when i write a long line in the terminal the code instead of continuing to the line below it starts again from the left erasing all the previous text and making it invisible :/
[12:08] <Giwrgaras> its weird
[12:10] <k1l> beliali2: best for depency and stableness would be to never touch the system again. but then you cant even fix bugs or security issues. and even the kernel got security fixes. so i would recommend to install them

[12:19] <k1l> beliali2: i do update to the latest offered kernel asap on my machines. but that can depend on your setup

[12:23] <ykzrtj> Hi all, I was interested in clustering two old CPUs together to make more efficient use of resources. Having checked out the thread here (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6495259), I was wondering any of you have practical advice or admonitions against such a plan.
[12:23] <beliali2> right. a newbie question then - where and how can i check what is the stable/latest versions for my current version of Ubuntu? I mean kernel.org shows a bunch of versions but I cant seem to see where it lists the distributions..
[12:24] <ykzrtj> sebastian: Have you checked the "Additional Drivers"?

[12:25] <ykzrtj> sebastian: The menu bar.

[12:31] <k1l> the first one with 3.16 was the 14.10 kernel. i forgot that the bot takes 14.10 as standard now
[12:32] <k1l> beliali2: its what ubuntu will upgrade to with apt-get dist-upgrade anyway
[12:32] <sebastian> ykzrtj, which one should I get? http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/du/02/DriverDownloadInfo.do?LG2=EN&CN2=&DSCMI=16845&DSCCHK=2a380828f942094ec7feca30171d61cb4cdd33e1
[12:32] <beliali2> riiight
[12:32] <sebastian> is there a command line thingy that i can type in the terminal that will indicate which i should get?
[12:33] <beliali2> and dist-upgrade will also upgrade ubuntu from 14.0.1 to 14.0.2 as well as the kernel ?
[12:33] <ykzrtj> sebastian: Is your Ubuntu 32-bit or 64-bit?
[12:33] <sebastian> ykzrtj, how do I check?

[12:46] <Nedal> Hi, Is there anyone who knows about the CCNA documentation downloading ?
[12:46] <lotuspsychje> hazzardous: or stream with vlc and use the record button(but that will make large video files)

[12:52] <hazzardous> will have a try!
[12:52] <hazzardous> Nedal, what do you want for your CCNA?
[12:52] <Nedal> lotuspsychje, did you ever worked with the CCNA exploration ?

[13:13] <supay> its too damn slow :/
[13:13] <k1l> supay: well, do you need to stream the desktop at all?
[13:14] <supay> k1l: hm, yeah.. that would be needed
[13:14] <supay> otherwise i was considering an ssh server or some such
[13:14] <k1l> supay: no way of just using ssh?
[13:14] <supay> nope, i need to be able to click around and see whats happening :(
[13:14] <benibadboy> How can one create a user without password?
[13:14] <supay> i can't do what i need to with just ssh
[13:14] <k1l> you can even open the remotes GUI window on your own system with ssh -X
[13:15] <supay> k1l: im on a mac, would that even work? :/
[13:15] <glogic> benibadboy: man useradd
[13:15] <supay> i mean, will it actually show the gui?
[13:15] <Ben64> supay: what exactly do you need to do graphically
[13:15] <supay> k1l: and for this, would i need an x server or something
[13:15] <supay> Ben64: test things through a browser etc..
[13:16] <benibadboy> glogic: I already used the --disabled password, but it gives me an error

[13:17] <Ben64> supay: yep
[13:17] <Ben64> supay: i think ubuntu comes with vino installed, which is a good vnc server

[13:18] <glogic> benibadboy: There's not any real way to do what you want without serious hacking. Best to just create the user and then # passwd --delete username
[13:19] <jfmcarreira> k1l: i am not rebuilding a package I am actually build it from scratch.
[13:19] <Ben64> supay: try opening up vino-preferences
[13:19] <Riberi79> How can i download softwares from a channel???
[13:19] <k1l> jfmcarreira: ok, see the manpage for skip signing then
[13:19] <supay> Ben64: ah, nice. that worked!
[13:20] <k1l> Riberi79: can you explain it more?
[13:20] <jfmcarreira>  k1l: can i then upload them to a ppa?
[13:20] <Ben64> supay: if you're doing this over the internet, you should really use a ssh tunnel to connect though, vnc by itself it not secure
[13:20] <k1l> jfmcarreira: erm no. but then you need to make a signing key anyway
[13:20] <supay> Ben64: we're on an internal network... security is not something im worried about atm
[13:20] <glogic> benibadboy: You could automate it in a bash script if you wanted to...
[13:20] <supay> Ben64: and after setting the password in vino-preferences?
[13:21] <supay> Ben64: do i need to get an ssh daemon or something?
[13:21] <Ben64> supay: well if its internal network, then that doesn't matter
[13:22] <supay> Ben64: now i can use something like http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/ to connect to the server?
[13:23] <benibadboy> glogic: I got it, by default there is no password... But if I want to su, I need to use [sudo su - username]... If I try [su - username] then it asks for password. Thank you for pointing me in the right direction (passwd -d username)
[13:24] <Ben64> supay: you should be able to use any vnc client
[13:24] <supay> okay..
[13:24] <supay> giving it a shot
[13:25] <glogic> benibadboy: Cool.
[13:25] <linux_daemon> guys, i followed this tutorial: http://www.havetheknowhow.com/Configure-the-server/Install-Putty.html but when i do the ssh connection, get access denied. how to solve this?
[13:27] <bazhang> try #ubuntu-server linux_daemon
[13:29] <linux_daemon> the server is on a local address...100.9 . so try: ssh root@192.168.100.9 ?
[13:29] <k1l> dont use root
[13:30] <k1l> root login is disabled on ubuntu and its not enabled to use the root account anyway. ubuntu uses sudo to give specific commands root permissions. you just run a regular user all the time
[13:30] <linux_daemon> ok, the user i have created on the vm is called: user. all i did is apt-get install openssh-server, didnt gedit the sshd_config, and i still get: access denied
[13:31] <k1l> try reloading the sshd with: sudo reload ssh # on the server
[13:33] <linux_daemon> still getting: access denied
[13:33] <k1l> see auth log on the server then
[13:33] <k1l> we dont know what you did setup there etc.

[13:50] <floodplain> hi all - i'm having extension problems with firefox 35.0.1 on 14.04 - the extensions just aren't working. does anyone know of a solution?
[13:50] <floodplain> i read that the firefox upgrade broke some functionality of extensions
[13:51] <lotuspsychje> floodplain: some extensions dont work on newer versions of firefox
[13:51] <lotuspsychje> floodplain: see the #firefox channel for more info on that
[13:52] <floodplain> lotuspsychje: ty, i'm asking there too. i was wondering if there a widely known simple solution :)
[13:52] <lotuspsychje> floodplain: well, ubuntu can't be responsible for wich addons users install right
[13:53] <teward> lotuspsychje: you're correct there.
[13:54] <teward> lotuspsychje: this happens ever version bump - a lot of no-longer-developed extensions drop off the radar as a result of not being updated for internal Firefox API changes - that's not an issue with Ubuntu, that's a Firefox AddOns problem unrelated to Ubuntu.
[13:54] <floodplain> lotuspsychje: oh of course - it's the default browser i thought, so i assumed others had run into the same problem ad hopefully had workarounds
[13:54] <teward> erm, floodplain my last message.
=== Guest16778 is now known as icecream
[13:54] <teward> floodplain: well, 'workarounds' would be to revert to the prior version - it's an internal API issue, not a 'workaroundable' situation to get the app into a newer Firefox
[13:55] <lotuspsychje> floodplain: or try the same kind of addon on chrome/chromium if it still works
[13:55] <floodplain> teward: cool, is there a simple way to downgrade to say version 34 using apt-get?
[13:55] <lotuspsychje> floodplain: keep in mind that downgrading means security flaws also..
[13:56] <floodplain> lotuspsychje: true true, maybe it's not worth it
[13:56] <lotuspsychje> floodplain: i would rather use current firefox, and search for addon alternatives
[13:57] <teward> floodplain: i'd suggest just using the current firefox and find alternative addons... unfortunately, that's because of the security content of Firefox 35 being superior/critical/important.  (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox/)

[13:57] <niko> hi
[13:58] <DalekSec> Hello.
[13:58] <teward> floodplain: if you truly want to downgrade give me a minute i'll go hunting for an apt-get command
[13:58] <vishnu_> splash screen apear for minute then ... go
[13:59] <DalekSec> teward: apt-get install firefox=exact-version
[13:59] <teward> floodplain: while I DO NOT recommend downgrading Firefox, you can possibly attempt to downgrade by doing `sudo apt-get install firefox=34.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.04.2` - no guarantees
[13:59] <teward> DalekSec: yes, I know, i needed the version string for them
[14:00] <DalekSec> Might have to mark a couple more packages for downgrading though.
[14:00] <teward> floodplain: if you are on Trusty use that one, if you are on Precise, use 34.0+build2-0ubuntu0.12.04.1 for the version string after the =.  34.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.10.1 for Utopic
[14:00] <lotuspsychje> vishnu_: nothing interesting in syslog or dmesg logs?
[14:00] <teward> DalekSec: true, but the last firefox update i ran it adapted accordingly - if not, then you can resolve the issues manually
[14:00] <vishnu_> ohhh .. i am checking
[14:00] <teward> floodplain: however, I stand by my initial suggestion - don't try to downgrade, just find alternative addons and check for updates to those addons regularly
[14:01] <teward> in case they get updated to be compatible

[15:21] <Knight80> No ideas?
[15:21] <newuser> EriC^^: yea, I wanted to use gpg but I don't know anything about it! so what if I move the files to another computer and do the decrypt then will it work ?? or in a new ubuntu installation on my own system also ??
[15:22] <EriC^^> yeah it'll work
[15:22] <EriC^^> in my experience
[15:23] <EriC^^> newuser: try and see
[15:24] <newuser> EriC^^: how to use the encrypted data on windows ?? and gpg --help shows -e for encryption and -c for encryption with symmetric cipher
[15:24] <EriC^^> newuser: gpg -o /path/to/decrypted file -d /path/to/encrypedfile.gpg
[15:24] <Knight80> Ok, problem solved, thank you.
[15:25] <EriC^^> newuser: gpg -c /file/to/encrypt , will create an ecrypted.gpg file in the same location
[15:25] <Knight80> Updating solved the problem.
[15:25] <EriC^^> newuser: never tried it on windows though... so try it and see
[15:26] <newuser> EriC^^: you mean encrypted.gpg as a password file ?
[15:27] <EriC^^> newuser: no it will create an encrypted file of whatever you encrypted
[15:27] <EriC^^> there's no password file
[15:27] <newuser> ok
[15:27] <EriC^^> you use the same passphrase to decrypt
[15:27] <newuser> ok
[15:28] <newuser> but when and where do I enter passphrase ?
[15:28] <newuser> before encrypting ?
[15:28] <EriC^^> after you type gpg -c /path/to/file
[15:28] <EriC^^> it will ask for a passphrase

[15:30] <EriC^^> yeah
[15:30] <newuser> is there any way of decrypting and cracking this ??
[15:30] <newuser> without passphrase ?
[15:31] <OpenTokix> newuser: yes, but it takes a while
[15:31] <OpenTokix> newuser: depends on resources
[15:31] <OpenTokix> newuser: and quality of your passphrase
[15:33] <newuser> OpenTokix: ok but as compared to archive compress and encrypt function how is this gpg method ?
[15:33] <OpenTokix> newuser: as good
[15:33] <newuser> I should be at ease for security then ? OpenTokix
[15:34] <OpenTokix> newuser: Depends what you are protecting against, like someone stealing your computer. - Sure. - Foregin goverment, probably not
[15:34] <newuser> governments for sure otherwise I dont worry about stealing
[15:34] <OpenTokix> newuser: you worry about goverments want your data?
[15:35] <OpenTokix> newuser: And ask about it on #ubuntu on freenode? ....

[15:36] <teward> [2015-02-04 10:35:17] <OpenTokix> newuser: And ask about it on #ubuntu on freenode? ....  <-- that's this channel
[15:37] <teward> OpenTokix: (I was only commenting on that part)
[15:37] <OpenTokix> teward: ok, don't
[15:38] <teward> newuser: encryption is a multi-faceted thing.  Unless your passphrase on your key is cryptographically strong in relation to the bitstrength on the key, it may be easier for governments / blackhat hackers / malicious threat actors to crack the passphrase on the GPG private key.  However, that private key is needed for decryption.
=== AnalogSmartPhone is now known as NetworkingPro
[15:39] <teward> newuser: if someone has your computer, then they have your private key and can start to try and bruteforce the password for the private key.  Ultimately, this is as good as encrypted ZIP files holding the data, albeit you don't get compression out of the box with the GPG encryption
[15:39] <teward> (unless you compress it and then encrypt the compressed file)
[15:42] <teward> newuser: so long as you keep your GPG private keys in a safe location, you should be relatively OK.  Choosing a cryptographically strong password helps (random letters, numbers, symbols, and punctuation, equal to a character length equal to the number of bytes that your bitstrength corresponds to)
