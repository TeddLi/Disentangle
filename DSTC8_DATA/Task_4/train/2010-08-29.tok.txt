<s> like i 'm looking at a screenshot , and it looks like it has an app launcher </s>
<s> and i agree with <user> to <unka> the netbook edition is not offtopic </s>
<s> <user> : its not insure i was able to shrink it , why cant i use copy and paste into a newer partition ? </s>
<s> <user> : oh , i got it , i thought there can be 4 primary in system at all . my bad ;) </s>
<s> i mean , i guess i 'll just install it and see :) </s>
<s> <user> : any mobo should work ok in linux . most problematic hardware is wifi cards ; vga cards and maybe webcams </s>
<s> <user> : no problem </s>
<s> <user> , have you tried clicking in the middle of the ubuntu partition and draging it to the far right end ? </s>
<s> <user> , that it gets rid of window borders and use a different <unka'> and other things ... but i 'm not sure , but as far as is ee in the <unka> it 's just a stripped down windows manager </s>
<s> <user> : yes did n't work , i think because the partition is not formatted ? </s>
<s> <user> : cool , i 'll give it a go </s>
<s> thanks :) </s>
<s> <user> : my current board only boots 1 out 3 tries , and i want to buy a cheap new one </s>
<s> <user> , ok now im confused , is there any thing on the ubuntu partiton ? </s>
<s> <user> : yes around 5gb </s>
<s> <user> , i 'm not sure if the current version work this way , but i saw one that 's just placed on top of a normal installation , that is you enable it , then your gui changes , you disable it and you get the standard gui , and in a youtube video some compiz effects can work on top a netbook edition , :d </s>
<s> <user> : cool , i have a dell mini 1012 and it 's pretty nice , but jolicloud <unka> things down too much </s>
<s> <user> , then the partition is formated , have you tried expanding the partition to the end of the drive and then <unka> it infront of the ubuntu partition ? </s>
<s> would a small ubuntu , intended just for recovery usage fit inside a 5gb partition ? </s>
<s> ! minimal | <user> </s>
<s> how to get medibuntu ? i want to install google earth </s>
<s> <user> : the minimal cd image is very small in size , and it downloads most packages from the internet during installation , allowing you to select only those you want ( the installer is like the one on the ! alternate cd ). see URL/https:/ URL/help.ubuntu.com/ URL/community/installation/minimalcd/ </s>
<s> <user> : if your considering ubuntu netbook , i use it on my dell mini 10v and love it . </s>
<s> ! medibuntu | <user> </s>
<s> <user> : medibuntu is a repository of packages that cannot be included into the ubuntu distribution for legal reasons - see URL/http:/ URL/www.medibuntu.org/ </s>
<s> <user> : the guy that <unka> you can use the netbook edition on top the normal <unka,> you wo n't be stripped down , jjust the gui :p </s>
<s> <user> , isint that one of the ones with the bcm4312 wifi chipset ? </s>
<s> no , not a medibuntu , i need to be able to open all files and mount encrypted file systems just if i need to ... i do n't want to use a stripped down edition , just to install an ubuntu and leave it instaled there :p </s>
<s> <user> : yep </s>
<s> <user> , *shudder* i set up a dell mini 9 with that , didnt sleep for a week . </s>
<s> <user> : haha its a peice of cake . all the needed packages to enable the driver are on the live cd . </s>
<s> thanks <user> </s>
<s> <user> , which disk did you use ? </s>
<s> <user> : just the standard live cd . </s>
<s> <user> : ca n't even get a terminal really ... you can , but you gotta do " start -> run -> gnome terminal " .... no way to add that as an " app " or anything </s>
<s> that is too limiting for me </s>
<s> <user> : by adding it to your repository list . you have to go to the website and read the repository howto to get your system to <unka'> where the repository is and what software is there . </s>
