[02:29] <bigusdickus> livingdaylight, with z you filter the archive through gzip effectively gunzipping it before extracting the archive, (for tar.gz or tgz files)

[03:36] <Ace_NoOne> hi there - quick newbie question: I'm determined to make finally the switch to Ubunto. Now I've read a lot about how Edgy screwed up many people's systems - does this only affect upgrades from Dapper or should I start with Dapper rather than Edgy?
[03:36] <n2k> sticazzi: i've got that on powerpc too.
[03:37] <DevDuck> it's a very customized system

[03:37] <[ANF]MasterNinja> yeah Edgy is like electronic love
[03:37] <jrib> [ANF] MasterNinja: I've only seen problems with the upgrade route for some people, but try both live cd's and see what you prefer
[03:37] <sticazzi> n2k, mine is a standard x86
[03:37] <DevDuck> it's running, so having gnomeoffice and the ilk isn't a big deal
[03:37] <jrib> Ace_NoOne: I've only seen problems with the upgrade route for some people, but try both live cd's and see what you prefer
