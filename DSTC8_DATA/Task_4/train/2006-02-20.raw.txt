[03:12] <adub> upayavir1   did you edit and save your xorg.conf
[03:12] <upayavir1> Was that supposed to disable it?
[03:12] <DjDarkman> hy ,a friend of mine can`t use his mouse ,and he has a serial port ,what should he do?
[03:12] <adub> upayavir1 there are other options from within that program
[03:13] <upayavir1> adub: it got the qsynaptics working.
[03:13] <tyler> how do i check what type of image file it is if its readable by gv???
[03:13] <Psi-Jack> DjDarkman: A serial, as in COM1 port?
[03:13] <upayavir1> but no option to change accelleration or anything tht will help me.

[03:14] <upayavir1> no. I'm just trying to move the mouse around the screen!\
[03:14] <Psi-Jack> DjDarkman: Need ot know which one, guy. PS/2, USB, or COM1
[03:14] <upayavir1> Try take mouse from middle of screen to top left, to applications menu, takes 11 swipes of the touchpad.

[03:17] <rem_> ok...but why dont i see a process for epiphany ?
[03:17] <[D-Tail] > then it says that the program will make a directory called 'fglrx-install'
[03:17] <[D-Tail] > then it proceeds to extraction - which fails horribly T_T

[03:20] <upayavir1> adub: they seem to be about scrolling speed, i.e. wheely mouse stuff.
[03:20] <upayavir1> And changing them to 'fast' doesn't make a difference.
[03:20] <adub> good idea why didnt i think of that........lol

[05:48] <soundray> zulfiqar, there is some reserved space. df shows 100% usage when there is still 5% space (to which only root can then write).

[05:49] <zulfiqar> rdr : i did it .. nothing dpoing .. on windows it shows correct empty space but on ubuntu it doesnot
[05:49] <brukental> mod^: usually if you can telnet to your domain to port 25, and not localhost it means that resolution to localhost is not done correctly.
[05:49] <mod^> hmm
[05:49] <zulfiqar> fdr i mean

[05:50] <Deepz> soundray: i uninstalled the new kernel and reverted back, now ndiswrapper works and i have net access again, ill try to reinstall the kernel maybe it was faulty
[05:50] <soundray> mlistus, ask Via to release specs to support free driver development. Meantime, best stick with VESA.
[05:50] <Deepz> thanks for your time
[05:50] <Deepz> :)
[05:50] <brukental> mod^: but you can telnet to port 25 by telneting to your domain? and does it give you postfix?
[05:50] <zulfiqar> soundray  : i have 100GB harddisk and 50GB is empty now ... df -h shows 100% used
[05:50] <brukental> mod^: like this... Trying 127.0.0.1...
[05:50] <brukental> Connected to localhost.localdomain.

[05:50] <brukental> 220 localhost.localdomain ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)
[05:50] <zulfiqar> on windows it reflects the correct emapty space
[05:51] <mod^> gah. now it says telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
[05:51] <soundray> Deepz, okay. This 'locate' command clearly showed that something hadn't installed properly.

[05:52] <soundray> zulfiqar, what if you unmount and remount it. Same problem on df -h?
[05:52] <brukental> mod^: okay try reinstalling postfix using aptitutde.
[05:52] <Deepz> so ndisdwrapper should work by itself without any need for recompilation right?
[05:52] <zulfiqar> I'm trying to defrag the drive on windows and then once done i will check again
[05:52] <soundray> Deepz, yes.
[05:52] <Deepz> ok tnx
[05:52] <brukental> mod^: remove it, do apt-get update, and run aptitude again to reinstall postfix.
[05:52] <zulfiqar> yes tried it on diffent ubuntu PCs
[05:52] <zulfiqar> same result
[05:53] <zulfiqar> checked the forums ... some other poepl have had the same problem but could not find a solution

[06:37] <yaaar> meisam: the commands have different syntax, my/postgresql are connection/socket based and MS isn't, they all 3 have different capabilities/features, and there are probably a dozen other inconsistencies that I don't even know about. If you are trying to learn MS SQL for certification purposes, the ONLY thing you want to learn on is MS Windows with MS SQL server!
