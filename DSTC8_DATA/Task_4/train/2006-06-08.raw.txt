[06:44] <AlwaysIcey> xnull, when you first log in, there should be a Sessions option.
[06:44] <ccamacho> any idea?
[06:44] <DShepherd> is it possible to make totem play a video slower than its normal rate (slow motion)?
[06:45] <moonman> Adrian_NZ, yeah, i was just wondering if there was any [software]  prep needed with ubuntu that i may not know about
[06:45] <makko> tritium: yet, isn't it wrong to hide the boot menu by default, seeing that many users will still want to use windows or another distro in parallel? or am in missing something again?
[06:45] <pdc303> mark105: right-click on the notifier in the Tray and go to Properties.
[06:45] <xnull> ok thanks
[06:45] <tritium> makko: if you want to use it, there is a grub splash image in /usr/share/pixmaps/grub/ubuntu-artwork.xpm.gz
[06:45] <farous> xnull if any is installed then you can do dpkg-reconfigure kdm
[06:45] <mark105> pdc303: thank you
[06:45] <makko> Flannel: yes, and nothing has changed
[06:45] <tritium> makko: no, because not everyone dual-boots

[06:45] <xnull> thanks thanks:)

[06:46] <nomasteryoda> chennaituxian, wow so simple
[06:46] <tritium> So, I don't see a bug
[06:46] <AlwaysIcey> farous, will dpkg-reconfigure kdm allow me to set up a video card with it? or do I have to do that through reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[06:46] <Adrian_NZ> <moonman>not that i can think of, just bung it in and see what happens! What kind of card are you installing?

[06:46] <farous> AlwaysIcey: that is xserver-xorg check if your card is works well with ubuntu first
[06:46] <moonman> Adrian_NZ, dont laugh, i got an ati 7000 64mb card to replace the agp 2x in my pentium 3

[06:47] <A-L-P-H-A> heh... I just realized there's another xserver problem. :)
[06:47] <chennaituxian> Faileas: once u understand u have the power wand :p
[06:47] <geotsai> ohsorry
[06:47] <nickrud> geotsai, then your sources don't have mutiverse enabled. What release are you using?
[06:47] <tritium> AlwaysIcey: have you tried VESA?
[06:47] <makko> tritium: i agree not everyone dual boots, but i guess almost everyone does this. isn't it a strange decision for the dapper team not to use a splash menu, especially seeing that breezy used to feature that? i mean, do you at least agree it's quite strange and maybe improper?
[06:47] <ccamacho> after update my Xorg to Xorg 7.0 and install fglrx driver I can get back to tty (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F1), I  receive a message from my monitor out of sync and a few seconds later my computer is completely  death..
[06:47] <farous> A-L-P-H-A: what is your card name
[06:47] <geotsai> nickrud 6.06
[06:47] <Adrian_NZ> <moonman> wahoo!!!, anyway, bung it in, then you may want to install the ati drivers, although i've never had an ati card myself so i can't be much more help than that.
[06:48] <AlwaysIcey> I'll try that.  One problem is, it doesn't detect the location and I'm not sure how to tell it in this computer.  It's an ISA card.
[06:48] <Faileas> chennaituxian: the thing i miss the most is multitasking personally, CLI forces you to focus
[06:48] <A-L-P-H-A> farous: ATI 9200, and ATI9200se... it works... but only for one card at a time... I can't get three heads running, as X crashes.
[06:48] <tritium> makko: if it's not hidden for dual-booters, where is the problem?
[06:48] <chennaituxian> Faileas: open up multiple terminals :D
[06:48] <moonman> Adrian_NZ, i got the card via newegg, so i could play this one game, www.ufoai.net should take you to the site for the game
[06:48] <Flannel> makko: Breezy didn't have a grub splash default either.
[06:48] <pres348> How can I have a command run as root at startup?
[06:48] <nickrud> geotsai, replace the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list with  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666
[06:48] <makko> Flannel: really??
[06:48] <moonman> Adrian_NZ, all freeware, and linux ready
[06:49] <tritium> pres348: update-rc.d can be used to install your own initscripts
[06:49] <Flannel> makko: really.
[06:49] <Faileas> chennaituxian: not as intuitive as a taskbar. if i wasn't aiming to learn CLI i'd have given up and gotten a WP by now
[06:49] <Faileas> *wm
[06:49] <makko> tritium: the problem is huge: it won't be eye candy
[06:49] <tritium> makko: menus are not eye candy
[06:49] <Barbecue> Ok. I apt-get install 'd  everything I need, but it give me a "Xsession: unable to start X session --- no "/root/.xsession" file, no "/root/.Xsession" file, no session managers, no window managers, and no terminal emulators found; aborting.

[07:06] <tritium> dr3wster: worst case, you could wipe out some of your hidden directories that store gnome settings
[07:06] <dr3wster> chennaituxian, well there are about 800 packages called "gnome" something or other in synaptic, but I don't see one that's just gnome

[07:06] <Skye---> Hi, i installed java and went through all the steps but it's still not working with firefox..
[07:06] <tritium> dr3wster: usually you install ubuntu-desktop to get gnome
[07:06] <pres349> tritium: Well, evidently, suspend doesnt work either, though I couldve sworn. And checking my syslogs, it drops off without mentioning anything about acpi or shutdown, just some stuff about the network and then right into booting, 5 minutes apart.
[07:06] <dr3wster> tritium, where would I find those hidden directories?
[07:07] <farous> dr3wster: can you restate your problem
[07:07] <tritium> pres349: hmm, okay...I'm not sure what to suggest...
[07:07] <tritium> dr3wster: in your user

[07:09] <tritium> dr3wster: or .gconf, perhaps
[07:09] <dr3wster> tritium,  so it's safe to just delete the whole file?
[07:09] <wizzlefish> for some reason, when I put down the lid of my laptop, if I open it again I get a blank screen on resume. Any ideas? I've tried looking at the LaptopTesting pages for my model, and they said it worked - but it's not working here.
[07:09] <chennaituxian> delete ?

[07:35] <kjon> I got a problem! - The horizontal scrolling feat. from synaptics driver does exactly the opposite when I use firefox.
[07:36] <NickABusey> I'm on AMD64 Dapper, but I can't get the nvidia drivers to load properly
[07:36] <kjon> What do I need to do to fix that?
[07:36] <farous> dr3wster: gnome-settings-daemon is part of the gnome-control-center try reinstalling it
[07:36] <kjon> with the other applications, the synaptics driver works fine.
[07:37] <farous> otherwise you will have to reinstall or continue debugging no one know how long either might take
[07:37] <dr3wster> farous, maybe this other error message will help.  I get it when trying to open the theme preferences window: Unable to start the settings manager 'gnome-settings-daemon'.
[07:37] <dr3wster> Without the GNOME settings manager running, some preferences may not take effect. This could indicate a problem with Bonobo, or a non-GNOME (e.g. KDE) settings manager may already be active and conflicting with the GNOME settings manager.
[07:37] <dust> william__, oh. it sounds really good, but i worked long and hard to install all the restricted formats (kicking myself now that i read about this program) and i'm kinda scared it will mess something up. but i remember it for a time when i feel more daring.
[07:37] <tcp|p> i'm getting the infamous grub error 18 on boot, is their anything I need to do other than make a small /boot partition?

[07:39] <gharz> everytime i start my system it says Kubuntu.
[07:39] <gharz> kubuntu seems to be bloated.
[07:39] <dr3wster> farous, ok, and why will this take time?  the installer itself does?

[08:49] <Faileas> neutrinomass: no...
[08:49] <neutrinomass> Faileas: Sorry, yes, you can't get the source.
[08:49] <human> now it should ask you about mount points, Kman

[08:49] <Faileas> i don;t have anything but the SSHD and LAMP stack
[08:49] <KenSentMe> ube_: first install windows and leave some free partition space for ubuntu, after that install ubuntu

[08:50] <ube_> kensentme: windows does not recognize the hdd

[08:50] <dreamcatcher> i got a complicated network and internet questions involving ubuntu gnome interface and a belkin router and a linksys router
[08:50] <Kman> with the unallocated?
[08:50] <mluu510> help. ubuntu said "according to mtab, /dev/hda5 is mounted on /tmp/disks-conf-hda5". how do i stop /tmp/disks-conf-hda5 from mounting?
