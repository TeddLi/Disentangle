[04:42] <durt> kurtbec oh yeah - yes pretty much just change all the "hoary"s to "breezy"s

[05:25] <tritium> hi crimsun!  I'm impressed - 1/2 a second after joining, you're answering questions :)
[05:25] <dean> malv - I was following http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=3713 step#2 - 1. sudo apt-get install linux-686 if you haven't already.
[05:25] <crimsun> tritium ;)
[05:25] <dean> or -k7 or -686-smp or -386... whatever matches your kernel.=== I chose 686 when I should've done 386, now my nic won't work... can anyone help?
[05:25] <justin_> ok
[05:25] <justin_> i did that
[05:25] <dean> malv - I'm  now getting an error when I reboot that says that an invalid module rt2500.ko  can not be loaded
[05:25] <justin_> now what
[05:26] <crimsun> justin_: and the output is...?
[05:26] <Trashcan> moreover i need g++, but wherever gcc was i was assuming to find it there
[05:26] <net10> yes, i can see the folder but when i try to open its contents, it says "the folder contents could not be displayed". @ tritium
[05:26] <Trashcan> now for tcl and tk :D
[05:26] <nootrope> How does one "right-click" with Ubuntu HH for PowerPC? I'm on a PowerBook.
[05:26] <malv> you need to recompile for that 686 version
[05:26] <tritium> net10, what happens when you go to Places->Network Servers ?
[05:26] <malv> you need the headers corresponding to it
[05:26] <bob2> Trashcan: install build-essential
[05:26] <Trashcan> yup, got it
[05:26] <Trashcan> :)
[05:26] <Trashcan> thanks
[05:26] <dean> let me see if I can figure it out malv... that should help
[05:26] <malv> dean: or you could just go back to the 386 version
[05:26] <dean> how can I revert?
[05:26] <bob2> Trashcan: you'll rarely need to run gcc manually, tho

[05:27] <bob2> ah

[05:28] <net10> we can see the shared folder but not the contents of it.
[05:28] <Toma-> misfit_toy: thats because they have a 4.95/min help hotline
[05:28] <Trashcan> ok :p

[05:44] <dmlinux> i knw
[05:44] <none_-> it's in /etc/X11R6/

[05:45] <benh> it's a separate package ?
[05:45] <durt> its in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:46] <tritium> benh, it's in gnome-system-tools
[05:46] <benh> tritium: not the front-end for configuring

[07:07] <Carpe_Libertatem> after I install fluxbox, how do I start it from cli?

[07:07] <dougsk> _RB_ use edit and then pick your kernel and then append init=/bin/bash or somesuch shoudl probably get you in remount rw / once you have a prompt

[07:09] <Trashcan> i scanned myself, 21 and 25 open
[07:09] <_RB_> k. i'll try that
[07:09] <bob2> Trashcan: because you installed vsftpd
[07:09] <Trashcan> on a clean install
[07:09] <tritium> no way
[07:09] <bob2> Trashcan: and configured psotfix to listen on that

[07:09] <Trashcan> is that postfix on 25?
[07:09] <_RB_> will i have to munt before i can apt-get ? the last command it boot, and it is the one that eventually stalls
