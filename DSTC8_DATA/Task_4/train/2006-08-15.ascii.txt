[06:49] <TheGame> does any1 know if theres a touchpad setup in ubuntu
[06:49] <cdew4545> morphix:  does that mean it already recognizes the card?

[06:49] <dougsko> TheGame: yeah theres a synaptic package i think

[06:49] <gutano> can I do a server install from a desktop install disk? (I'm out of CD's, and I'd rather get my install going tonight)
[06:49] <TheGame> let me open up syn
[06:50] <dougsko> TheGame: theres an article in the wiki about it i think

[06:51] <cdew4545> morphix:  I will run through that again, but im pretty sure I already tried that.  Does it matter if the network is encrypted or not?  In ubuntu it always seems to want a key, but i live out in the country and only am keeping my wireless router here for another week so i didnt bother with encryption
[06:51] <morphix> Lil_Shank: i assume u normally connect through USB and use PPP login in windows??

[06:56] <gutano> can I do a server install from a desktop install disk? (I'm out of CD's, and I'd rather get my install going tonight)
[06:56] <Jbirk> I kind of want a list of what it does?  Does it do fancy Macintosh type stuff?
[06:56] <yossman> Xgl + compiz + cgwd is very cool
[06:56] <yossman> it gets cooler every day
[06:56] <cbx33> yossman, I agree
[06:56] <morphix> Lil_Shank: i honestly dont know, go into the web interface of the modem to change it
[06:56] <cbx33> vvveerrryyy coool
[06:56] <dougsko> so does anybody have any idea why lidvdcss unscrambles my dvd fine, but there's still no sound?
[06:56] <erisco> I can't tell if ubuntu has safely halted or not, and it is still a bother with the power not turning off because then I have to pull the plug every time
[06:56] <ardchoille> Jbirk: You'd have to read up on XGL to see if it suits you. I feel that XGL is nothing more than a resource wasting toy.
[06:56] <yossman> i showed it to like 20 people the other day

[06:56] <yossman> what?

=== loopout [n=loopout@24-55-98-109.clspco.adelphia.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[06:59] <gutano> erisco: the kernel you are using probably doesn't have the correct power management functions compiled in, if this is a stock ubuntu kernel, your choices are to install your own outside the package manager, roll your own package, look for someone else to give you a package (if they have fixed a similar issue), or deal with it....  depending on your level of motivation and technical skill (I may have missed an approach)
[06:59] <genpatton7> yossman: Windows doesn't recognize the drive now either
[06:59] <yossman> erisco, so yea maybe ubuntu doesn't know your system's particular APM management
[06:59] <yossman> genpatton, and it won't, no
[07:00] <yossman> erisco, actually heh that might be it, if your system uses APM instead of ACPI that could be a problem
[07:00] <erisco> gutano yossman, so my solutions are to find what my APM management version or type is
[07:00] <yossman> erisco, do a search on ubuntuforums.org for your motherboard
[07:00] <yossman> brand, model
[07:00] <yossman> see if anyone else has similar issues
[07:00] <dougsko> erisco: yeah thats a tough one, that might even be a kernel problem. does dmesg give any clues?
[07:00] <yossman> you could also expand that search to google.com
[07:01] <gutano> erisco: it is a simple option in the kernel... usually not very hardware specific

[07:09] <Tonren> genpatton7: Hang on, I'm sure there's a way.  Let me google for a sec
[07:09] <anzio_> does anyone know of a good bit torrent program for Ubuntu? or perhaps a website where I can get information on the default Ubuntu bit torrent client?
[07:09] <c0rrupt`> 686?
[07:09] <genpatton7> tonren: thanks
[07:10] <erisco> dougsko, don't worry about it
[07:10] <morphix> c0rrupt`: also, are u sure u r actually booted into that kernel?
[07:10] <Tonren> Does anyone know how to make trashed files on external media go to the actual trash, instead of a special trash INSIDE the external media?
[07:10] <c0rrupt`> yea.
[07:10] <Flannel> anzio_: btdownload[frontend]
[07:10] <c0rrupt`> booted into latest kernel
[07:10] <Tonren> anzio_: sudo aptitude install bittornado bittornado-gui
[07:10] <morphix> c0rrupt`: yeh well just install linux-restricted-modules-686
[07:10] <c0rrupt`> the old kernel had the drivers working
[07:10] <anzio_> thanks
[07:10] <Tonren> anzio_: np

[07:24] <UpMarc> can someone help me with the installation of an application?
[07:24] <Tonren> majd_: There is your problem!  When you try to access a computer using the WAN (public) IP, the router doesn't know which computer to forward the request to.

[07:24] <UpMarc> onelife151: jahshaka
[07:24] <majd_> Tonren, but i made port 93 forward to my ubuntu machine
[07:24] <Tonren> majd_: There are two solutions.  1) Connect using your LAN IP (the one starting with 192.168), or 2) Set up port forwarding on your router.  Since you are just testing, 1 is --  ah.
[07:25] <Tonren> majd_: So, what error message do you get?
[07:25] <Flannel> majd_: do you have sshd listening on 93?
[07:25] <majd_> sftp is ssh right?
[07:25] <UpMarc> u run the sudo apt-get install jahshaka up to the end
[07:25] <visham> hey anyone expert in fonts in here
[07:25] <Tonren> majd_: You may also be experiencing problems because sometimes, when you try to access your public IP address, your DNS server says, "That's yourself, you jerk," and you never actually get to the router.  In other words, sometimes it "Defualts" to localhost.
[07:25] <UpMarc> but cannot find it anywhere
[07:26] <morphix> majd_: if ur modem/router has a built in firewall it might block u trying to get back through ur network, since its similar activity to that of a land attack
[07:26] <visham> i need to change the console fonts in here
[07:26] <majd_> Flannel, in my router's settings, i have app 'ssh' forwarding ports 91-95 to my local ip
[07:26] <majd_> morphix, hmmm
[07:26] <majd_> the problem is
[07:26] <ardchoille> UpMarc: That app isn't in the repos, which is why apt-get cannot find it
[07:26] <majd_> i can't test it

[07:59] <thundr> alienseer23, just out of curiousity, what phone are you using it with?
[07:59] <Madpilot> davidrincon2006, do normal CDs get automounted?
[07:59] <ubuntu_realuser> ok im trying to do this
[07:59] <ubuntu_realuser>  sudo mount -t ext3  /dev/sda1 /recovery -o nls=utf8,umask=0222
[07:59] <thundr> alienseer23, no problem
[07:59] <ubuntu_realuser> but it says ext3 is not a fs
[07:59] <UpMarc> I used to do that with WMM (I want its correpondent for Ubuntu)
[07:59] <ardchoille> UpMarc: I understand.. but I don't know any apps for that. Maybe someone here can point you in the right direction for film editing apps
