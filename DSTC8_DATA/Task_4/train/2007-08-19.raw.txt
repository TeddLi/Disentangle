[12:37] <Lindar> Hi hi, I'm having some problems. I have previously installed ndiswrapper and successfully got online with a WG111T, but after rebooting, the device no longer shows up in either the network config utility or iwconfig. Anything I've done wrong?
[12:37] <CoY> you have ubuntu its already installed
[12:38] <CoY> you may have to add in
[12:38] <rockets> lufis, that site just suggsets installing the realplayer package. I don't want realplayer.
[12:38] <PriceChild> lufis, pidgin is not in ubuntu repos so please don't suggest it when gaim works fine.

[01:52] <PriceChild> Blauhaut, if you've got 64bit ubuntu on 64bit proc... openssh, databasing and video encoding will be marginally faster... but nothing much overall
[01:52] <ehc> Hadron, the user option allows me to mount it. while mounting it give me permissions to read and write?
[01:52] <lindar> I'm trying to install ubuntu on a dell latitude, but every time it goes to install it, I get some sort of I/O error.

[01:55] <Goooner> When I try to install Ubuntu to ext3, it tells me, "No root file system is defined"
[01:55] <patrlck> I had a HD crash and now it my FS is read-only
[01:55] <PriceChild> Goooner, make sure your main partition is set to "/"
[01:55] <Goooner> Oh sorry, nvm
[01:56] <Hadron> if so type "mount" and look at the mount properties.
[01:56] <ehc> Hadron, not off the top of my head. but I could look it up. I want it to automatically  allow my user to read it.
[01:56] <patrlck> I tried mount -o remount,rw / but I get this error : mount: block device /dev/disk/by-uuid/48b73949-d3f8-439b-a079-80d188753d7b is write-protected, mounting read-only
[01:56] <afaik> oh duh.. my disk was mounted, so it couldnt partition it
[01:56] <Hadron> the defaults are for "rw" for ext3. e.g UUID=7dbc023b-6777-4dc5-8bac-23c3908d00ca  /home                    ext3         defaults                            0  2
