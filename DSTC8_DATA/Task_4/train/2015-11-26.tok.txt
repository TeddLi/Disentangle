<s> <user> : we ca n't help with something that 's not in front of you really ; as we 've said we need more info from the real situation to advise </s>
<s> no it was not , checked anything . </s>
<s> i do n't understand that sentence </s>
<s> tell me how you would handle it then . </s>
<s> <user> , how can you possibly check from such a great distance </s>
<s> i got home after <unka> up there , simple . </s>
<s> you ca n't scan for a wireless network 20 mins away ... </s>
<s> being able to hands on with the network is key here <user> </s>
<s> <user> : do you own your own laptop , or a smartphone perhaps that can have a program installed to check networks and what channels they're on ? </s>
<s> 20 minutes away is much further than hands on </s>
<s> <user> : if the laptop can connect to other networks ( try one at your home ) then it 's either hidden ssid or the channel does n't work so you have to change it in the router . you ca n't do anything right now </s>
<s> <user> , when your ssid does not show up , disable wlan , go into keys & passwords , remove the wlan key entry , and <unka> again , etc </s>
<s> </s>
<s> ah har </s>
<s> okey in other words : the laptop worked for months without problems , now the ssid it used to connect to is gone . the hardware is checked , other oses work as they should , the 60 old owner never touched a thing so the settings are 100% certain okay . what would be your steps to research it ? </s>
<s> we already told you </s>
<s> you seem to be ignoring all input </s>
<s> if it 's someone else 's there 's no way to access anything </s>
<s> probably in many channels .. </s>
<s> hello </s>
<s> you need a direct wire to access it </s>
<s> <user> : did you try to connect to a different network with the laptop ? </s>
<s> <user> where is this keys and password thing ? </s>
<s> i purged settings already , but i might <unka> one . </s>
<s> on unity > systemsettings </s>
<s> you know , my own network is often hidden beneath the networks list under " more networks " also </s>
<s> this one used to be <unka> , so it wont be so far . </s>
<s> its xfce <user> </s>
<s> <user> , get in range and test again , withe the multiple advice already given </s>
<s> i do n't know the xfce menu , keys & passwords is universal , search for it . </s>
<s> your advice was to find out the channel right ? tell me why is that important , it never changed at all . </s>
<s> getting a pcie wifi card to work with ubuntu was ridiculous ! lol </s>
<s> <user> , you said you are at a great distance now </s>
<s> <user> : that 's not a rule , maybe just the model you got is badly supported </s>
<s> <user> , how can you test anything at this range </s>
<s> <user> : you do n't know that , a lot of routers are on <unka'> channel selection and thus would hop when powered off rebooted </s>
<s> maybe that was it . it was an asus pcie card </s>
<s> are you talking about the gnome keyring <user> ? </s>
<s> it'd make more sense to accept that in computing topics , you assume nothing and <unka*> , <unka*> , then <unka*> again* </s>
<s> well it works when booting an other partition , it must be the laptops settings then . so i dont get why you want me to check the router . </s>
<s> right because another os may not be tied to the same regulatory domain for channel selection </s>
<s> look , instead of fighting free advice ... write it down and go try again </s>
<s> get in range first </s>
<s> dude its deep night here . </s>
<s> i cant wake her up to fix her computer . </s>
<s> good evening everybody </s>
<s> <user> , you cannot fix it from this distance , what you are asking is simply not possible under present conditions </s>

<s> i ask for steps to fix it , not for the actual fix . </s>
<s> because i am simply lost . </s>
<s> <user> , we have given those many times now </s>
<s> <user> , all of them require a <unka> fixable distance </s>
<s> no you have given one , that is to check the wlan channel , and this cant be the proble ,. </s>
<s> the user sleeps , you are lost , we have answered . </s>
<s> <user> , if you're in a country that has channels <unk#-> enabled on the router , but the driver is n't working for those channels , changing <unka> to <unk#-> may be your answer . as said above , if the router is set to auto channel , it could have changed to channels <unk#-> </s>
<s> <user> : why not ? </s>
<s> because i only need to ram in a live cd and it works , so i need to find out where the difference between the live cd and the install is . </s>
<s> you said another os earlier , you never specified it was a live cd . i personally assumed it was windows . </s>
<s> also , it was suggested earlier to clear the keys or something related to that . those wo n't be stored on your live cd </s>
<s> you can also look through DIR/var/ DIR/log/ DIR/messages/ , dmesg , and all the other logs on the system to see if something is throwing an error . </s>
<s> yea , indeed keys are my gues , i know that is a frequent nm-applet bug . but i already removed all settings i could think of . </s>
<s> i never heard of an error message that signals that a specific ssid is not found , that makes absolute no sense to me . </s>
<s> you asked for suggestions , i 'm just throwing them out . i have no idea what model wireless nic you have , and i 'm not going to go researching it for you . </s>
<s> if you're not happy with free support , i suggest looking elsewhere . </s>
<s> i cant check anyway . </s>

<s> from that last link : " i recently had this problem and solved it changing the channel of my wifi router to 10 , looks like there were too many ssid 's in my previous channel ... " </s>
