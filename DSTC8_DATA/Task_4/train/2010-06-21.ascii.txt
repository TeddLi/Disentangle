[04:50] <Alan502> HI! I just need some help with sharing the Internet connection sharing: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1514078
[04:50] <airtonix> greetings, having issues with localhost/127.0.0.1 only responding when a network device is up.
[04:51] <loopidity> valbaca my wireless network is created by me, so i do not even know the AP
[04:51] <swtchrly08> hi everyone
[04:51] <airtonix> Alan502,  if you have UFW installed you could use that to do it. (i also believe that the network-manager has some support for it )
[04:51] <valbaca> loopidity do you mean you're using internet sharing from your computer?
[04:52] <Davin> Two part question. Hopefully, these are both quickish answers. 1) To create a new extended partition that will be subdivided into logical partitions in GParted, do I select the entire free space and then break it up after that? 2) For setting up Ubuntu, does the formula of / of 20 GB, swap of 8 GB (I've got 4 GB RAM), and the remaining as /home sound sensible?
[04:52] <]Alex[>  CIAOOO a tuTTi da  ]Alex[
[04:52] <loopidity> i have a ppp0 connection and the wireless is created out of it valbaca, if that makes sense
[04:52] <CaNoc1> hello, does pulseaudio, alsa have something like ASIO in windows?
=== CaNoc1 is now known as CaNoc
[04:52] <r007> Davin yes select all the free space and create an extended...
[04:53] <r007> Davin then create a logical within
[04:53] <valbaca> Davin 2) yes, you'll find with 4GB of RAM the swap will be used very little. you could get by with 4 or even 2 GB
[04:53] <Davin> r007, Ok good, the first part seemed like that was how it would go, but wanted to check.
[04:53] <Ray78> anybody ever installed Flying angel UMTS USB modem on Ubuntu?
[04:53] <airtonix> Alan502, ah i see, windows actually has an option to bridge two network devices when you highlight them both, or you can get properties of the wan device and choose to share its connection
[04:54] <valbaca> loopidity yes that makes sense, i'm going to do some searching to find an answer
[04:54] <swtchrly08> has anyone tried win7 theme?
[04:54] <airtonix> greetings, having issues with localhost/127.0.0.1 only responding when a network device is up.
[04:54] <loopidity> Ray78 i installed hdspa/umts usb for infostrada
[04:55] <Davin> valbaca Yeah, from what I've read, it seems it's not going to get used too much, but figured I'd err on safe side as Ubuntu alone is getting 128 GB between those three things, and since I'm using this for science research, I figured i'd err on side of having more space for swap to work with than less since I don't think a couple gig one way or the other will hurt me for data storage
[04:55] <Alan502_> HI! I just need some help with sharing the Internet connection sharing: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1514078
[04:55] <Ray78> loopidity, anything from the software center i need to installed
[04:55] <r007> airtonix it will only respond when a network device is up as something putting it in laymans has to answer the door
[04:55] <airtonix> Alan502_, you should really ask this question in #windows
[04:55] <valbaca> Davin I agree then. 8GB swap sounds good then
[04:56] <Alan502_> airtonix, hmmm i think it has to do with setting up my ubuntu host use the virtual machine as a gateway
[04:56] <loopidity> Ray78 when you connect the usb, does it load?
[04:56] <Alan502_> airtonix, did you read my post?
[04:56] <loopidity> Ray78 maybe a cd drive comes up, or something
[04:56] <airtonix> r007, ok, if for example i disconnect all wifi and unplug all lan cables... i can not : ping localhost, or access http://localhost. reconnect any network connect (regardless if it gives me internet access) then localhost responds as expected
[04:57] <Davin> valbaca awesome, and 20 GB should be plenty for root then? My first Ubuntu experience so not entirely sure yet on the importance of that, so making sure I'm set from the start
[04:57] <Ray78> loopidity, the CD only came with MacOX .pkg folder.. i dont know if that can be use
[04:57] <airtonix> Alan502_, yes, have you already tried to use the standard methods to share a network connection in windows ?
[04:57] <r007> airtonix and thats normal as you have no network connection
[04:57] <airtonix> r007, no its not.
[04:57] <Alan502_> airtonix, yeah, i've done what would normally work on a physical network
[04:57] <imyousuf> valbaca: Thanks, we already did apt-get update and upgrade, but to no avail
[04:58] <loopidity> Ray78 i mean, when I put my usb, a virtual cd rom auto loads,
[04:58] <klenwell> anyone have a suggestion for good bash command for checking whether a package is available in a repo?  My best: $ sudo apt-cache showpkg foo | grep 'Package: foo'
[04:58] <r007> airtonix localhost or not what do you expect to cary your network request carrier pigieons?
[04:58] <Alan502_> airtonix, seriously i feel like i'm missing only the last step!!
[04:58] <loopidity> Ray78 anything like that for you?
[04:58] <valbaca> Davin I would put more. remember, all your programs, var, tmp, etc. all go under /
[04:58] <imyousuf> maco: I do understand that implementation is difficult but the feature is basic ;)
[04:58] <Ray78> loopidity, yup.. got the Cd mount
[04:58] <airtonix> r007, you understand what localhost is ?
[04:58] <r007> local or external you stll need network services
[04:58] <r007> so do you?
[04:59] <Alan502_> airtonix, i think its kind of a problem with the interface, since it's not using eth0 but vboxnet0
[04:59] <airtonix> r007, 127.0.0.1 should work regardless if i have a network connection.
[04:59] <imyousuf> maco: will follow the wiki link and create a bug, thanks for the direction!
[04:59] <loopidity> Ray78 the eject the cd rom(by right clicking) but do not remove the usb
[04:59] <Ray78> loopidity, i browse the CD (mounted) and find .pkg folder for MacOS but nothing for linux
[04:59] <r007> no it wont
[04:59] <valbaca> imyousuf i agree that it is basic, but unfortunately there is a lag-time between new laptops coming out and being able to be fully usable under linux
[04:59] <airtonix> r007, it always has for me
[04:59] <Ray78> loopidity, ejected
[04:59] <Alan502_> airtonix, any ideas?
[05:00] <r007> you need a network interface otherwise your machine is stand alone
[05:00] <loopidity> Ray78 wait for a few seconds and it should remount
[05:00] <airtonix> r007, i dont think you actually understand what 127.0.0.1 is
[05:00] <ZaxEZ> lol
[05:00] <Ray78> loopidity, yup.. remount to TF-UMTS MMC Storage
[05:00] <r007> I actually do I dont think you understand what uses 127.0.01
[05:01] <r007> 127.0.0.1 even
[05:01] <xxiao_> r007, aritonix is right, you don't need a network whatsoever when 127.0.0.1 is used
[05:01] <Davin> valbaca, particular number you'd recommend? some of the online stuff I was finding was ranging 10 to 20 GB, but system sizes always going up put stuff out of date over time. Does another 10 GB go far enough, or would I not be at any disadvantage if I just had seperate partitions for root and for swap, but not for home (as some things say I can do) so that I don't have to guess the space it needs ahead of time?
[05:01] <r007> what do you think it sends out on your cd-rom?
[05:01] <Traveler1> i need help trying to get my tv to display ubuntu
[05:01] <loopidity> Ray78 now does anylight flash?
[05:02] <Ray78> loopidity, yup..
[05:02] <Googolplex> anyone in here have experience with wireshark
[05:02] <hydr0tux> Hi guys :)
[05:02] <Traveler1> how do i edit the xorg.conf
[05:02] <ne7work> what is this software channel?
[05:02] <airtonix> Alan502_, its been a long time since i used windows, but i do remember that you need to have both the lan and the wan devices appearing in network-places for windows to offer the ICS feature
[05:02] <coldpizza> Weeeee
[05:02] <swtchrly08> googolplex, on windows
[05:03] <ne7work> when I install skype this says me to new version on software channel?
[05:03] <ne7work> how can I go to software channel?
[05:03] <airtonix> Alan502_, do you see the vboxnet0 device in network-places ?
[05:03] <ne7work> what is this?
[05:03] <coldpizza> airtonix: Just do this.
[05:03] <hydr0tux> When using VMware with NAT and my ETH0 firewalled with iptabels, this automaticly makes my NAT connection secure for windows right ?
[05:03] <r007> you need a network adapter to use localhost
[05:03] <hydr0tux> and there for I don't need any firewall on windows os ?
[05:03] <valbaca> Davin most of the time I don't even bother with giving /home its own partition, that way its just / and swap
[05:03] <Pr3nt1c3> I'm trying to play hedgewars with some friends.... but game isn't even starting... as in nothing happens
[05:03] <Alan502_> airtonix, windows has a wizard called "home connection" or whatever, but i already set it up so it would share its internet connection
[05:03] <Pr3nt1c3> ideas?
[05:03] <loopidity> Googolplex a little bit, did crack my neighbour's wep
[05:03] <r007> or a network connection
[05:04] <Traveler1> how do i edit xorg.conf
[05:04] <Alan502_> airtonix, yes, it is on windows connections :)
[05:04] <Juanto> effff
[05:04] <Ray78> loopidity, what should i do next.. how am i supposed to dial from here
[05:04] <loopidity> Ray78 right click on the the network manager on the top panel, is there Mobile broadband?
[05:04] <airtonix> Alan502_, so now you just need to have ubuntu use vboxnet as its default gateway
[05:04] <Alan502_> airtonix, not as vboxnet0 though, windows names them Local Area Connection #1,2,3....
[05:04] <Alan502_> airtonix, exactly!
[05:04] <Juanto> anyone good with configing nvidia gpus?
=== Spliffeh is now known as Xenox
[05:04] <Alan502_> airtonix, i don't know how to do it though :(
[05:04] <jdsbluedevl> hi, can anyone help with my network connection?  For some reason, Ubuntu recognizes the two Ethernet cards I put in, but refuses to connect.  Could this be a hardware problem, or is this a software problem?
[05:04] <Pr3nt1c3> I uninstaled the game... and reinstalledbut still... _nothing_
[05:04] <airtonix> Alan502_, when you use ifconfig does vboxnet0 have its own mac address ?
[05:05] <coldpizza> Wow.
[05:05] <loopidity> Traveler1 /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d maybe
[05:05] <Ray78> loopidity, not in the detected list
[05:05] <hiexpo> loopidity,  - be careful what you say as to illegal content please we do not promote illegal activities in anyway
[05:05] <hydr0tux> any ideas ?
[05:05] <Alan502_> airtonix, let me see..
[05:05] <Pr3nt1c3> I've even rebooted
[05:05] <Pr3nt1c3> but still... epic fail
[05:05] <airtonix> Alan502_, also check that it has an ip address (it should in theory be 10.0.2.2)
[05:06] <Traveler1> this is illegal what im asking for?
[05:06] <r007> Traveler1 nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf (case might not be exact)
[05:06] <airtonix> Traveler1, what makes you think that ?
[05:06] <Traveler1> someone sad that
[05:06] <swtchrly08> has anyone tried win7 theme
[05:06] <Davin> valbaca Alright, thanks... then if it doesn't make much of a difference, I'll just do swap and / and not try and do /home as a separate partition. Easier on me if it won't be a problem for me

[05:07] <Pr3nt1c3> why is it that after changing to ubuntu after linux-mint that I'm stll experiencing error like there's no tomorrow???
[05:07] <swtchrly08> where else would i ask this it is a theme for ubuntu
[05:07] <theadmin> Pr3nt1c3: ?
[05:07] <theadmin> swtchrly08: Not a support question, so #ubuntu-offtopic
[05:07] <airtonix> Alan502_, no its fine, what you need to do though is create a network connection with network manager in ubuntu with the ip address of vboxnet0 as your gateway.
[05:08] <loopidity> Ray78 Systems-->preference-->network connection
[05:08] <Pr3nt1c3> I've tried starting hedewars like.... 15 times now.. but I can't even get an error msg
[05:08] <theadmin> swtchrly08: Also, there is a TON of Windows-7-like themes out there, not just one :P
[05:08] <r007> lmao htf can you think you can do network communication without an actual network connection
[05:08] <Pr3nt1c3> wtf s going on?
[05:08] <Alan502_> airtonix, so network connections>wired>add
[05:08] <Ray78> loopidity, there is a tab for mobile broadband in the Network Connection
[05:08] <hiexpo> !language
[05:08] <ubottu> Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
[05:08] <Alan502_> airtonix, and i have to put the mac adress of vboxnet0?
[05:08] <jdsbluedevl> hi, can anyone help with my network connection?  For some reason, Ubuntu recognizes the two Ethernet cards I put in, but refuses to connect.  Could this be a hardware problem, or is this a software problem?
[05:08] <airtonix> Alan502_, so assuming the vboxnet0 is 192.168.56.1, you would set a "manual" adress of : 192.168.56.10 subnetmask : 255.255.255.0 gateway : 192.168.56.1
[05:09] <Davin> this may be a dumb question, but do i need to worry about the order of the partitions? either swap before / or / before swap?
[05:09] <Ray78> loopidity, i already put in the detail in there but i dont know how to use
[05:09] <Googolplex> hey im lookin for someone with experience with wireshark just have a couple general questions
[05:09] <airtonix> Alan502_, it would help narrow the connection down to the device to use. you can enter the mac address on the first tab.
[05:09] <theadmin> Googolplex: Well, ask them, if someone knows, someone will answer.
[05:09] <r007> Davin dont matter
[05:09] <Googolplex> in wireshark is it possible to analyze packets over the network from more than just your own machine?
[05:09] <Davin> r007 thanks, making sure the final leg of this goes smoothly, so im being cautious
[05:09] <airtonix> Alan502_, you'll also want to insert opendns dns server ip address in the dns server field : 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220
[05:10] <hiexpo> !wireshark | Googolplex
[05:10] <r007> as long as your Linux partition is /
[05:10] <hydr0tux> any one in here uses vmware ?
[05:10] <Googolplex> !wireshark
[05:10] <theadmin> Hm. I have /dev/sdb1 immideately followed by /dev/sdb3, no /dev/sdb2 whatsoever, what gives? o_O

[05:11] <shwouchk> I am using ubuntu in a VM. When I'm in gnome or in ssh, keyboard works fine. When I am in a local tty though, the keyboard arrows don't work as intended. Help?
[05:11] <shwouchk> hydr0tux: not much. What is your question?
[05:11] <theadmin> airtonix: Well, how come there is first and third but no second? :/ I guess that's because I just deleted the second one lols, let's see if replugging it will help
[05:11] <Pr3nt1c3> how do  I get hedgewars to run in lucid?
[05:11] <hydr0tux> shwouchk, I'm using Ubuntu linux as my main os with iptables.

[05:12] <r007> wouldnt listen to a thing airtonix has said prsonally
[05:12] <hydr0tux> shwouchk, would that automaticly protect my windows ?
[05:12] <theadmin> Yeah it works... Hm. Whatever :D

[05:12] <hiexpo> dooglus,  google wireshark it is kinda off topic here  there are lots of great tutorials out there you need to go to torrents and do a search for wireshark and download the book there is a lot to it
[05:12] <zipper> hey any1 good in podcast programs?
[05:12] <hydr0tux> hydr0tux, all I need to know is this, will my windows box be behind iptables too?
[05:12] <r007> he thinks you dont need a network adapter for network communication
[05:12] <shwouchk> hydr0tux: yes
[05:12] <hydr0tux> shwouchk, since I use NAT right ?
[05:12] <airtonix> hydr0tux, to someone who hasn't written them before it is overwhelming ... specially compared to ufw rules
[05:13] <shwouchk> hydr0tux: yes
[05:13] <hydr0tux> shwouchk, thank you :)

[05:18] <Pr3nt1c3> I have all the 'needed' pkgs installed
[05:18] <vane> zeronice1, i don't know i was out of the city, and my little syster was playing on the pc
[05:18] <Pr3nt1c3> I'm just trying to play  game with some friends
[05:18] <Ray78> loopidity, yup still here
[05:18] <Pr3nt1c3> but game won't start
[05:19] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: you should be able to do it directly from the network manage, typically a icon in the top right if you're using gnome.
[05:19] <Ray78> loopidity, there is a tab for mobile broadband in the Network Connection
[05:19] <r007> you have too love the response yes then 10 mins later when they have actually done it
[05:19] <hydr0tux> Pr3nt1c3, oh yeah, don't do games sorry mate.
[05:19] <loopidity> Ray78 add
[05:19] <loopidity> Ray78 see if that shows the usb drive
[05:19] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: ok, well, I'm in the Network Manager, what now?  How do I disable one of the cards?
[05:19] <zeronice1> vane: that could be bad lol.

[05:19] <r007> what happened to the people who thought they didnt need a nic to do localhost
[05:20] <airtonix> xxiao, i just discovered my localhost issue is with chromium only. all other browsers will access localhost fine regardless of network connection status
[05:20] <vane> zeronice1, can you help me please??
[05:20] <hydr0tux> any one using XChat here ?
[05:20] <Ray78> loopidity, cant see the device
[05:20] <xxiao_> shwouchk, so far the safest way to disable gdm is rename /etc/init/gdm.conf to anything else, e.g. gdb.conf.noexec
[05:20] <airtonix> hydr0tux, just about everyone
[05:20] <nvclocknoob> ohhh ty the
[05:20] <hydr0tux> airtonix, how do you hide all this messages *
[05:20] <Traveler1> why is this so hard im so sick of this is there an easy way to et my tv to conect with my PC as my monitor
[05:20] <hydr0tux> airtonix, its anoying as hell
[05:20] <loopidity> Ray78 how is the light on the usb flashing?
[05:20] <xxiao_> shwouchk, so far the safest way to disable gdm is rename /etc/init/gdm.conf to anything else, e.g. gdb.conf.noexec
[05:20] <airtonix> hydr0tux, what messages ? people joining and leaving ?
[05:20] <hydr0tux> airtonix, yes
[05:21] <Ray78> loopidity, constant blue color flashing
[05:21] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: try right clicking on the device and selecting disable.  Not sure if thats the correct wording.
[05:21] <airtonix> hydr0tux, right click on the room entry and select hide join/part messages
[05:21] <zeronice1> vane: ill try. do u have any partitions like windows
[05:21] <shwouchk> xxiao_: but the way I did it, I will still be able to start it manually if I want
[05:21] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: no such option
[05:21] <hydr0tux> airtonix, lol that was easy, thanks maty
[05:21] <loopidity> Ray78 that means it is registered but not connected
[05:21] <airtonix> hydr0tux, 50% of the noise gone
[05:21] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: I'm right-clicking on Auth eth0, but no menu comes up
[05:21] <hydr0tux> exactly :)
[05:21] <loopidity> Ray78 who is the provider?
[05:21] <hydr0tux> my eyes where flashing here lol
[05:22] <loopidity> Ray78 click on Add and follow the steps,
[05:22] <vane> zeronice1, i have windows on other disk, on the disk with linux, i have swap partition, system partition and home partition
[05:22] <jibbles> hey all, is anyone here using bazaar?
[05:22] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: does it have an enable check box?
[05:22] <hydr0tux> airtonix, very good nickname choice as well :D
[05:22] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: no
[05:22] <nvclocknoob> how do i use nvclock?
[05:22] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: wait a sec
[05:22] <Traveler1> i guess theres no hope for me
[05:22] <loopidity> Ray78 see how far you can get, you will need some details of you provider, you can easily go and ask them if you need to
[05:22] <xxiao_> shwouchk, that's good then
[05:22] <colde89> I whant to use utf8 in latex. in a header I will use this line:  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}  witch pakage do I have to install in lucid lynx?
[05:23] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: oh, I have to go into the editing menu
[05:23] <xxiao_> airtonix, thanks for the chrome finding
[05:23] <hydr0tux> airtonix, you python coder ?
[05:23] <xxiao_> gtg
[05:23] <shwouchk> xxiao_: but I definitely agree it is intrusive and annoying... I wish there was a way to manage it
[05:23] <Ray78> loopidity, i manage to setup the connection as the provider is listed
[05:23] <shwouchk> xxiao_: have a good one
[05:23] <Ray78> loopidity, how am i supposed to be dialing it
[05:23] <r007> can we have some server questions please
[05:23] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: ok, I wasn't sure exactly how it would look.  See what that does.
[05:24] <loopidity> Ray78 great, so the connection has been set right?
[05:24] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: ok, deselected "connect automatically" on Eth0 (connection is on Eth1), no luck
[05:24] <loopidity> Ray78 now rightclick the network manager on panel
[05:24] <Jeebs> No one for helping me to get my drive to format?
[05:24] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: is restarting network-manager enough, or does it require a reboot?
[05:24] <loopidity> Ray78 do you see the mobilebroadband connection
[05:24] <Davin> I promise I'm running out of questions here... for file system, and given that I'm dual booting with Windows 7 and will want to have at least some access from one to the other, is ext4 fine to use? I've seen stuff mentioning programs to access ext2/ext3, but ext4 isn't mentioned. Don't know if it's just old info or if ext4 isn't as accessible
[05:25] <airtonix> hydr0tux, yes
[05:25] <hydr0tux> :)
[05:25] <r007> Davin use ext3
[05:25] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: no, simply enabling or disabling the connection is enough.  If eth0 doesn't change try the other way.  I assume you have a valid connection on one of the devices?
[05:25] <loopidity> once /dev/sr1 is ejected, is there a way to plug it back without physically removing the usb device?
[05:25] <Traveler1> why does ubuntu have to be so hard
[05:25] <Ray78> loopidity, that is the bad part, not in the panel list.. even when i setting up the provider, it seem like dint detect the USB at all at the first screen
[05:25] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: yes, I do have a valid connection, tested it on another computer
[05:26] <airtonix> Alan502_, did it work ?
[05:26] <abhi_nav> Good morning! :)
[05:26] <Ray78> loopidity, seems like i'm missing something on the initializing part
[05:26] <Davin> r007, thanks. And does it need a label as I set it up with GParted, or just instruct Ubuntu that is to be / partition when installing?
[05:26] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: switching doesn't help
[05:26] <loopidity> Ray78 with the usb plugged in, try restarting ubuntu (cause mine works only after restarting)
[05:26] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: ok verify you have an address and ping your router on either device.
[05:26] <r007> Traveler1 put it into context imagine your missus said why does it have to be so soft which is better
[05:27] <loopidity> Ray78 I am assuming you have added the device correctly
[05:27] <Ray78> ok.. will try
[05:27] <vane> ??
[05:27] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: but you gave me a good idea.  I'm going to remove one of the cards and see if I have a connection.
[05:27] <Traveler1> why cant someone try to help me
[05:27] <Alan502_> airtonix, i already made the interface, i'll connect the modem now brb
[05:27] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: I mentioned it because on
[05:27] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: you mean ping it from my working computer or my nonworking Ubuntu computer?
[05:27] <lukehasnoname`> has anyone had trouble using the USB installer creator?
[05:27] <ranjan> Traveler1, whats your problem??
[05:27] <r007> labels are for your use only but it will need to be /
[05:27] <Ray78> loopidity, the adding part is not correct i think, as the USB not recognized as a modem
[05:27] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: from the non-working connection.
[05:28] <jdsbluedevl> ok, how do I ping it?
[05:28] <lo> hello
=== lo is now known as Guest15327
[05:28] <loopidity> Ray78 you could ask your provider with the details of your connection
[05:28] <Traveler1> im trying to connect my tv to my computer via DVI but i get a message saying that res isnt correct but i cant change it
[05:28] <loopidity> loopidity who is the provider?
[05:28] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl:' ping <address>'  from a terminal/shell
[05:28] <Ray78> loopidity, Digi from malaysia
[05:29] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: oh, nvm, I see where you're coming from.  I don't have a router, as the connection comes directly from the university
[05:29] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: they don't allow routers
[05:29] <nvclocknoob> lol
[05:29] <loopidity> Ray78 were you able to find Digi on the list?
[05:29] <loopidity> Ray78 i m on ubuntu10.04 and i see them
[05:29] <nvclocknoob> gpart isnt loading..i ran the command and it said it wasnt installed..i just installed it
[05:29] <r007> Devin labels are for your use only but it will need to be /
[05:29] <Ray78> loopidity, yup.. its listed, the AP all all other info are automatically listed
[05:29] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: and even so, what address?
[05:30] <Traveler1> ranjan get my last message?
[05:30] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: I'm guessing 127.0.0.1 is not the proper address, right
[05:30] <jdsbluedevl> ?
[05:30] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: try 'ifconfig' from a terminal to verify your address
[05:30] <loopidity> Ray78 that looks good, did you restart and see
[05:30] <zeronice1> vane: its hard for me to  tell you what to do because im not sure what ur sister did. if i were you i would google what the grub prompt your getting actually is and why it could be showing up.maybe even booting into a live cd and trying to see what could have happened in there
[05:30] <loopidity> Ray78 make it connect automatically
[05:30] <Ray78> loopidity, ok will do now
[05:30] <zeronice1> could be good
[05:30] <r007> telnet localhost 25
[05:31] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: no addresses in ifconfig
[05:31] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: one sec, I see two, but they're under lo, not eth1
[05:31] <r007> no need for a network connection there oh no lol
[05:31] <Davin> hopeful final question... i take it swap has the filesystem that contains swap in the name?
[05:31] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: I see 127.0.0.1 and 255.0.0.0
[05:31] <hiexpo> 127 is the addr
[05:31] <Dan11b> can anyone help me figure out how to get my sound card to work
[05:32] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: ok, I'm pinging 127.0.0.1, what should I be seeing if it's working?
[05:32] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: verify which device is up and plugged in (eth0 or eth1)  then from a terminal type 'ifup eth0'
[05:32] <nvclocknoob> is it muted?
[05:33] <Dan11b> ...my sound card? no
[05:33] <zeronice1> vane: this could help https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
[05:33] <hiexpo> i just pinged your ip and it is good
[05:33] <nvclocknoob> sometimes it is..but if there is no speaker icon it's not installed and started
[05:33] <vane> zeronice1, thank i will check =)
[05:33] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: or ifup eth1 whichever you are using thats enabled.
[05:33] <Dan11b> i have a speaker icon, sound comes in extremely distorted and cracky
[05:33] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: apparently neither, as both are giving me permission denied, then when I tried sudo, it says "Ignoring unknown interface eth1=eth1"
[05:33] <nvclocknoob> what sound card?
[05:33] <zeronice1> vane: sorry i couldent help u more and good luck
[05:33] <chilli0> Hello , How can I stream music/videos on my xbox 360 from ubuntu 10.04? And maybe for music have playlists if that's possible.
[05:34] <Dan11b> sound blaster xfi extreme gamer
[05:34] <Jeebs> Are any file system/ubuntu installation pros around? besides you r007
[05:34] <vane> zeronice1, relax =)
[05:34] <nvclocknoob> are you overclocking or have an onboard card enabled?
[05:34] <hiexpo> ping 127.0.0.1
[05:34] <Dan11b> im not overclocking and i disabled the onboard sound card, at least i think i did
[05:34] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: and again, what am I supposed to see in the ping?
[05:34] <nvclocknoob> make sure the onboard is disabled first
[05:34] <r007> jdsbluedevl type this and give us your output  lshw -C network
[05:34] <wvm> Hi all, I have a problem with wired networking: since an update of Lucid a month or so ago it does not connect to my network any more when booting. This is a major problem as authentication is over the network so network must be up immediately upon boot. Manually running 'ifup eth0' (as root) brings up the network easily. This used to be automatic until I ran an update.
[05:35] <hiexpo> see if it responds
[05:35] <Dan11b> under sound preferences it its disabled
[05:35] <jdsbluedevl> r007: I have to transfer via thumb drive, give me a few minutes
[05:35] <nvclocknoob> good, but it shouldn't be detected..disable it in bios...but since it's disabled it shouldn't interfere..
[05:36] <hiexpo> i pinged it so it is good
[05:36] <nvclocknoob> hmm
[05:36] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: you should see results.  However you need to get a device to grab an address.  If eth1 isn't working try eth0
[05:36] <hydr0tux> airtonix, still there bud?
[05:36] <nvclocknoob> distorted all that time? or just in a certain application? what ersion ubuntu?
[05:36] <Dan11b> all the time
[05:36] <Dan11b> and let me check the version (im really new to ubuntu)
[05:36] <nvclocknoob> kk
[05:37] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: well, I'm getting something that says "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=X ttl=Y time=Z ms"
[05:37] <hiexpo> iwconfig
[05:37] <airtonix> hydr0tux, yes
[05:37] <Dan11b> 10.04 LTS
[05:37] <hydr0tux> airtonix, did you get any of my msg
[05:37] <nvclocknoob> same, but i had issues with my sblive first off a while ago when 8.04 was the first version i came across
[05:37] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: thats a localhost connection, not a network connection
[05:37] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: then I don't have a network connection
[05:37] <nvclocknoob> now it just detects and runs
[05:38] <Dan11b> my sound card is detected under sound preferences
[05:38] <carlosleon> Hi there o/
[05:38] <nvclocknoob> now what drivers have been installed for it..ubuntu usually just loads alsa and that works
[05:38] <Pr3nt1c3> after re-inst everything to do with hedge... it's now working...
[05:38] <Pr3nt1c3> thanks for the help **
[05:38] <Dan11b> i dont know how to check that
[05:38] <Jeruvy> jdsbluedevl: correct, if 'ifconfig' shows no address you need to manually bring it up using 'ifup', if that doesn't work I'd be looking at the network to be the issue.  Perhaps your uni needs something specific to hand you an address.
[05:39] <nvclocknoob> hmm
[05:39] <jdsbluedevl> r007: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/452766/
[05:39] <carlosleon> can I find in this channel some support for Empathy?
[05:39] <Alan502_> airtonix, i found out it doesn't work :\ i'm starting to suspect it is something that it didn't do well on the virtual machine
[05:39] <hiexpo> ifconfig will give you the ip if you are connected  or otherwise just your local ip in which is 127.0.0.1
[05:39] <nvclocknoob> like my sblive says it's using alsa
[05:39] <isw> Is there any other ubuntu gui apps like avant window?
[05:39] <Alan502_> airtonix, i noticed i cannot be connected to the vboxnet0 connection i created and eth0 at the same time, though?
[05:40] <nvclocknoob> down my usage tracks
[05:40] <bastid_raZor> isw: cairo-dock
[05:40] <nvclocknoob> "default mixer tracks"
[05:40] <Dan11b> if i go to sound preferences under applications it says alsa plug in
[05:40] <isw> bastid_raZor: thanks
[05:40] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: no, it was working fine and dany 2 weeks ago.  Then the network sharing that I was using for my Roku got borked, I did a fresh install of Ubuntu, and now no Internet connection
[05:40] <nvclocknoob> and the rest are auto detected?
[05:40] <jdsbluedevl> jeruvy: and when I plug the connection into my MacBook, it works quite well
[05:41] <Dan11b> the rest of what, under applications in sound preferences thats all i see
[05:41] <nvclocknoob> yes, there.. just making sure something hasnt changed there
[05:41] <jdsbluedevl> r007: did you get the pastebin?
[05:41] <Dan11b> yeah all i see is AlSA plug in
[05:42] <mf_417> Hi, does anyone know about an open source windows pptp client ?

[05:45] <hiexpo> Leemp,  what do u mean not lock up the terminal?
[05:45] <Leemp> bastid_raZor: Thanks
[05:45] <Dan11b> alright, it runs fine under windows
[05:45] <Leemp> hiexpo: When you launch a process the terminal won't take any input until that process ends.
[05:46] <Leemp> hiexpo: disown takes care of that

[05:46] <Suit_Of_Sables> Hello, does anyone know why, when installing from a Lucid Live CD to a macbook, grub-update would fail? Each time I try to install when it gets to 93% and runs grub-update if gets that fatal error. I continued the installation without the bootloader. I am trying to make this a dual boot machine with Ubuntu and OSX. When I hold alt on startup, the ubuntu partition shows as "windows"  and when booted from, just brings me to some
[05:46] <Suit_Of_Sables> grub 1.9something bash like command line interface.  When I boot from the OSX partition it can't even see the linux partition except in disc utility. Again, what would cause grub-update to fail? Do I need a internet connection to install Lucid from the live CD? >.< Can I install grub from OSX in someway so I can boot the linux system?
[05:46] <Dan11b> i wish i could go back and pick another of the 3 drivers i had an option to picking, but i duno how to get back to that option, the system > admin > hardware drivers doesnt come up with anything for sound card, just for graphics
[05:46] <Leemp> hiexpo: Yea, but then you have to leave that one open the whole time.. not really optimal heh.
[05:46] <maco> barqs: also, your nick is quite tasty and caffeinated :)

[05:52] <nvclocknoob> and it's plugged into the green port correct? no damage to the wires?
[05:52] <isw> bastid_raZor: thanks a ton again man this is very very nice.

Happens with both ext3 and 4. afaik the drive is not part of a raid array, I only plugged it in yesterday. It has one partition on it already which is ntfs.trying to format unallocated space.
[05:55] <Suit_Of_Sables> HermanDE_: Would installing rEFIt on the OSX system allow me to boot the linux system?
[05:55] <nvclocknoob> try installing "alsa mixer" via add/remove software..the gui version
[05:56] <nvclocknoob> some people have had results messing with the volume slider there
[05:56] <Traveler1> anyone know where to get the drivers for ATI
[05:56] <Dan11b> lol okay how do i do that
[05:56] <ubuntu_> is xubuntu faster than ubuntu?
[05:56] <HermanDE_> Suit_Of_Sables, My experience of Linux on Oldworld and NewWorld Macs are well established...  The new IntelMacs are a big black hole for me....
[05:57] <Leemp> I think i have a bad make installation of a program. How would i clean it up? Just go in and start deleting willy nilly? Or is there some method to it?
[05:57] <HermanDE_> ubuntu_, Yes, of course, only on tuesdays, When the moon is high and a sweaty beer is in the left hand....  That should answer your past few questions....
[05:58] <HermanDE_> Leemp, make clean
[05:58] <razz1> topics
[05:58] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Or was it shoddy from the "make install"?
[05:58] <wildbat> Jeebs, from gparted?
[05:59] <Jeebs> This is just during installation of ubuntu
[05:59] <Leemp> HermanDE_: I think it was a shoddy install. I've got a python2.5 that i have no idea what put it there (i was trying a few different things)
[05:59] <ranjan> Hi all :) problem with NVIDIA restricted drivers in Lucid ....Ny help??
[05:59] <Leemp> HermanDE_: Either way, my working py2.5 install, at /usr/local/python2.5 is *not* the same as my /usr/bin/python2.5
[06:00] <wildbat> Jeebs, use gparted in live session see what you got~ always partition then reboot be4 the actual install ~
[06:00] <pawan> hi
[06:00] <Shamoun> hey guys
[06:00] <Jeebs> alrighty
[06:00] <pawan> how to assicoate vuze to torrents
[06:00] <Leemp> HermanDE_: So i fully want to purge the /usr/bin/python2.5 variant, and then make a link from my working one to the /bin location
[06:00] <Shamoun> i tried asking this in xubuntu but noone has an answer
[06:00] <Traveler1> i need drivers for an ati card where do i get them from
[06:00] <pawan> its not the default
=== Kinch is now known as Kinch2
[06:00] <Shamoun> how do i manage what services start up with the pc in xubuntu. i have googled for it and someone asked the same question in the forums and there is simply no answer
[06:01] <Kinch2> Why does kubuntu crash all the time?
[06:01] <Dan11b> is there a way to reinstall the drivers for it?
[06:01] <nvclocknoob> well its using alsa
[06:01] <bullgard4> ranjan: Describe your nvidia problem more precisely please so that others can help.
[06:02] <Izinucs> Kinch2: I don't have that problem
[06:02] <Dan11b> is there different versions of alsa
[06:02] <Kinch2> Izinucs, care to tell me a bit about your hardware?
[06:02] <Izinucs> Kinch2: are you using Karmic or Maveric?
[06:02] <nvclocknoob> which is like a linux emulater, that support a wide range of cards
[06:02] <ranjan> bullgard4, its with the plymouth
[06:02] <kr3w> is KDE faster or GNOME
[06:02] <Kinch2> Karmic
[06:02] <nvclocknoob> have you updated recently?
[06:02] <Dan11b> yeah
[06:02] <nvclocknoob> k then it shuould be up to date
[06:02] <ranjan> bullgard4, the plymouth resolution gets lowered after installing nvidia restricted drivers
[06:02] <Dan11b> and it gave me 3 options to choose sound card drivers
[06:02] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Wow....
[06:02] <Izinucs> Kinch2: AMD 4500+ .. 4gigs ram.. 3 harddrives.. nvidia gforce 8200 motherboard and video etc. etc.
[06:02] <Dan11b> i chose one and went from no sound to this crackling sound
[06:02] <nvclocknoob> add/remove software is under applications btw
[06:03] <Leemp> HermanDE_: lol
[06:03] <nvclocknoob> and have you disabled surround sound?
[06:03] <Kinch2> Izinucs, Hmm pretty different from what I was running it on, you're on karmic?
[06:03] <Dan11b> no
[06:03] <HermanDE_> Leemp, That is an amazing push....  Ubuntu is dependent on a version of Python....  Uninstalling/modifying can get ugly...
[06:03] <nvclocknoob> try disableing surround sound
[06:03] <Dan11b> where would i do that at
[06:03] <Leemp> HermanDE_: Lucid doesn't even come with 2.5
[06:03] <nvclocknoob> you made need the alsa-gui
[06:03] <Izinucs> Kinch2: yep.. one quirk with my motherboard is it won't boot a live cd or the system without pci=nomsi in the kernel boot line
[06:03] <colde89> I whant to use utf8 in latex. in a header I will use this line:  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}  witch pakage do I have to install in lucid lynx?
[06:04] <HermanDE_> Leemp, The make install will attempt to modify paths....
[06:04] <bullgard4> ranjan: I do know that other people experienced the same problem. Look it up in Launchpad please.
[06:04] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Then things start to get ugly....
[06:04] <Leemp> HermanDE_: That's why i was installing it. Those jerks removed 2.4 and 2.5 from the repos heh
[06:04] <nvclocknoob> i need to d/l it myself lets do this d/l the alsa-gui via the add/remove software under application menu
[06:04] <Kinch2> Izinucs, I couldn't figure out anything I was doing wrong, it was a vanilla install and although I could successfully install it I was getting crashes for every other program I opened
[06:04] <Leemp> HermanDE_: I don't get what the problem is? Ubuntu relies on 2.6, right?
[06:04] <Dan11b> alsamixergui?
[06:04] <Line> hello, how can i mount a dd image of a hard disk with the read only option enabled?
[06:04] <Traveler1> someone please help me im trying to find drivers for my system
[06:04] <Izinucs> Kinch2: you should try opening some of those crashing programs from cli and see if there is any indication as to why
=== _rwc is now known as _rwc_afk
[06:04] <ranjan> bullgard4, its a famous bug and found all over the internet :)
[06:04] <HermanDE_> Leemp, That is the beauty of Ubuntu/Debian....   Next time install the debian version....
[06:04] <nvclocknoob> "gnome alsa mixxer"
[06:05] <maco> colde89: texlive-latex-extra
[06:05] <ranjan> bullgard4, but the workarounds i tried is not working
[06:05] <Lint01> Line, -o ro
[06:05] <colde89> maco: thanks, I will try
[06:05] <Izinucs> Kinch2: are you using a "store bought" machine?
[06:05] <elie> hey guys
[06:05] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Sure....  It's been awhile since I compiled /make/installed python...  It used to fsck with my paths....
[06:05] <Leemp> HermanDE_: Odd, out of all the Googling, no one suggested a debian version heh
[06:05] <Kinch2> thanks Izinucs I'll try that, yes its a sony laptop circa 2003
[06:05] <nvclocknoob> dan both i believe
[06:06] <elie> please save me: my apache is having an environment TZ=America/Chicago! why is it not following the local timezone?
[06:06] <Leemp> HermanDE_: I don't get what it might have screwed with though. python still runs py2.6
[06:06] <bullgard4> ranjan: Hm. In that case I suggest that you report it in Launchpad so that it is documented for the developers.
[06:06] <Izinucs> Kinch2: have you tried googling it with model # and "kubuntu" to see what pops up?
[06:06] <HermanDE_> Leemp, (Insert really smart ass remark here)   ...  :)
[06:06] <Knat> I have a program crashing which is trying to send sound to a sound card, the problem is there is no soundcard, is there a way to route all sound output to /dev/null or something
[06:07] <Line> Lint01, sudo mount -o ro loop,offset=1048576B backup.img  /media/backup/
[06:07] <Line> Lint01, will that work?
[06:07] <Leemp> HermanDE_: ?
[06:07] <Kinch2> Izinucs, ya, nada
[06:07] <Lint01> Line, -t loop
[06:07] <HermanDE_> Leemp, It should be easy to go through the make file and see what was installed/where....
[06:07] <bullgard4> !sound |Knat
[06:07] <Izinucs> Kinch2: how 'bout on the forums?
[06:07] <ubottu> Knat: If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
[06:07] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Do a surgical strike....
[06:08] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Take care that the python 2.6 is not using it....
[06:08] <HermanDE_> Leemp, The make file should be easy to read...  Look for the install section...
[06:08] <Leemp> HermanDE_: So where would that be? Are you saying that to uninstall something, you need the source installation files?
[06:08] <Izinucs> Kinch2: I gotta ask.. even though it sounds like you've probably already done it.. have you tried a full sys upgrade with "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" ?
[06:08] <Lint01> Leemp, that's a danger of source installs
[06:08] <HermanDE_> Leemp, If you installed using the source....  The you should uninstall using the source....
[06:08] <Kinch2> Regarding sound issues, the problem I had was that alsamixer had muted, or turned down the volume on the main out
[06:09] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Sometimes there is an uninstall in the make file....
[06:09] <Kinch2> Try alsamixer in the terminal and see if you need to just crank the volume
[06:09] <HermanDE_> Leemp, try "make uninstall"
[06:09] <Kinch2> Izinucs, ya, I had high hopes for an update
[06:09] <Izinucs> Kinch2: how much ram do you have?
[06:09] <Kinch2> 2 GB
[06:09] <Izinucs> Kinch2: should be enough.. 32bit or 64?
[06:09] <Leemp> HermanDE_: So, you're saying that debian installers work just as good as ubuntu repos?
[06:10] <Kinch2> 32bit
[06:10] <Izinucs> Kinch2: DOH!  '03 machine should be 32
[06:10] <Leemp> HermanDE_: I've never been told that :/, it's always been either use a repo, or compile it yourself
[06:10] <Kinch2> KDE is fairly resource intensive I suppose, but I would see it crawl not crash
[06:10] <Kinch2> Izinucs, I think I may just install KDE in an ubuntu install and go from there
[06:10] <Traveler1> someone help me
[06:11] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Ubuntu is based on Debian....  The DEB package is exactly the same.....
[06:11] <zeronice1> Traveler1: with?
[06:11] <Kinch2> Traveler1, you made it to IRC
[06:11] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Even deps are dealt with the same.....
[06:11] <Izinucs> Kinch2: if you do, don't install the entire kubuntu-desktop.. just the kde WM
[06:11] <jkalex05> it feels cool to have a PC without windows
[06:11] <HermanDE_> Leemp, DEB...  Yes, that is Debian Packaging....
[06:11] <Kinch2> Izinucs, right.
[06:11] <Leemp> HermanDE_: Man, bizarre.
[06:11] <Traveler1> why would something not let me click install
[06:11] <jkalex05> im lovin ubuntu... now i gotta learn how to work it thru the terminal
[06:12] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Nope...  Just history.....  Ubuntu is a fork of Debian that feeds back to Debian.....
[06:12] <Leemp> HermanDE_: Yea i know, but i literally, have *never* seen someone say "just go grab the debain repo package"
[06:12] <zeronice1> Traveler1: can you elaborate more?
[06:12] <bastid_raZor> !terminal | jkalex05 great howto here :
[06:12] <ubottu> jkalex05 great howto here :: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
[06:12] <Leemp> HermanDE_: I mean, people are making crap deb installers of their own, in launchpad repositories..
[06:12] <Kinch2> Regarding debian packages, I have had the problem when installing packages made for debian that the debian repos have newer versions which your package may depend on
[06:12] <HermanDE_> Leemp, It's just a bit obvious to some that have been here for awhile.....
[06:12] <nvclocknoob> dan are you still with me?
[06:12] <Leemp> HermanDE_: Why are they doing that if they can just use the deb repos.
[06:12] <Dan11b> yeah im here man
[06:13] <nvclocknoob> both programs do the same thing
[06:13] <Leemp> HermanDE_: I am honestly flabbergasted heh.
[06:13] <nvclocknoob> i think gnome enables more features
[06:13] <Kinch2> Izinucs, thanks for your help I should look closer at the debug info in the console
[06:13] <Izinucs> Kinch2: I run "u" on my laptop and "k" on the desktop.. With the latest updates on both I have a hard time deciding which to focus on.. I do like the new kde desktop despite what some say.. integration with gmail, calendar is a bit problemmatic but semi functional.. akonadi server and stringi give me occational issues.
[06:13] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Welcome to the forks of OS's.....  :)  Back to that smart ass remark above....
[06:13] <Kinch2> It happens so often that I figure it must have been something I dide
[06:13] <Leemp> HermanDE_: Alright, well on that note, why is it not advised for me to use a python2.5 from Karmic?
[06:14] <nvclocknoob> but you should be able to disable or mute or decrease the volume of various surround sound settings..like center and 3d..etc
[06:14] <Kinch2> Izinucs, I've used KDE in other environments and it beats gnome hands down for efficiency
[06:14] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Debian has a very slow release cycle....  But the releases are high quality.....  Ubuntu is on the bleeding edge....  Some packages are worse than others.....
[06:14] <Leemp> HermanDE_: I've been warned not to. Wouldn't Karmic be even closer than a Debian repo?
[06:14] <guenots> quit
[06:14] <Dan11b> yeah
[06:14] <Knat> bullgard4: I'm running ubuntu on a remote server, I don't have any xwindows installed.  I am running some software and outputting it to xvfb.  The problem is its trying to also output sound, I need to set up a fake sound card device that just dumps everything thats passed to it to /dev/null, Gnome has a device snd-dummy which is availible while gnome is running, i was wondering if theres another way
[06:14] <Izinucs> Kinch2: if it's a vanilla install then most likely it incorrectly assigned a driver or something
[06:14] <razz1> I just installed 10.04, I have a dual digital tuner, nvidia gpu. Haven't installed nvidia driver yet. I want to set up Mythtv. Do I need Nvidia driver. everythin seems to be workin fine with the default driver/
[06:14] <Kinch2> Izinucs, that's gotta be it...
[06:14] <nvclocknoob> try disableing /muteing "surround"
[06:14] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Sure.....  You have a choice....  If one fails, try another.....
[06:15] <Kinch2> My guess was the ATI driver so I tried installing a different version with no success
[06:15] <nvclocknoob> i also notice that both my sound cards are enabled..and using each other as well
[06:15] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Or create your own package.....  Very easy....
[06:15] <Dan11b> if i mute then i get zero sound
[06:15] <Izinucs> Kinch2: check dmesg and see if there are any errors after a crash as well
[06:15] <nvclocknoob> one over rides the other..
[06:15] <Dan11b> if i mute surround sound that is
[06:15] <nvclocknoob> ??
[06:15] <Dan11b> if i mute surround sound, i get no sound from anything
[06:15] <Izinucs> Kinch2: or on boot for that matter.
[06:15] <nvclocknoob> then your plugged into the blac/surround sound jack..or have a system hooked up to your pc?
[06:16] <HermanDE_> Leemp, I reserve compliling to systems that I can't get prepackages and would be a complete PITA to create a package for.....
[06:16] <Dan11b> um i dont think so, ill check on the back
[06:16] <Dan11b> i sent you a pm btw
[06:16] <HermanDE_> Leemp, In my case I have 2 systems across 6 servers, 10 workstations that were a PITA to package....
[06:16] <nvclocknoob> ah
[06:16] <Shamoun> hey guys, i am running xubunut and it doesn't have the services manager that ubuntu does. i need to have smbd and nmbd start automatically with my pc, how can i do that via command line?
[06:17] <Leemp> HermanDE_: What makes things a PITA to package?

[06:18] <Emry> Does anyone know the name of the package that does the notifications? :P
[06:18] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Crazy make files that require custom precompilied binaries from vendors to even think about working....  At least in these two cases...
[06:18] <rww> Emry: notifications being the little bubble things that pop up on occasion, or the icons in the panel?
[06:18] <razz1> I was using Zimbra in windows. Should I move to evolution or stay with zimbra in ubuntu

[06:19] <Emry> :)
[06:19] <rww> Emry: notify-osd
[06:19] <jibbles> Leemp, put " &" after the command. If you don't want the command to quit when the shell (terminal) is closed, put "nohup " in front as well.
[06:19] <Jeebs> Hey, I tried gparted to format my drive
[06:20] <Jeebs> no deal
[06:20] <Emry> rww: Thanks.  I will search for info on that first and see if it is behavior I can tweak.  :)
[06:20] <Leemp> HermanDE_: So, can i simply add various debain repositories? Or should i install these things by downloading them first? And on that note, if i have multiple sources for a single package (ie, python2.6), how do i deal with that?
[06:20] <bullgard4> Knat: May be googling for "dimmy sound device" will help you. I do not know.
[06:20] <bullgard4> Knat: May be googling for "dummy sound device" will help you. I do not know.
[06:20] <nvclocknoob> how do i use nvclock?
[06:20] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Your choice....  You could use apt-pinning and put in other repositories as you choose....  Create your own repository for custom stuff....
[06:21] <Fanshawe> Hey all. How does one go about mounting partitions automatically on startup?
[06:21] <HermanDE_> Leemp, The pinning will enable you to set one as very high priority....  And another to completly ignore unless called for....
[06:21] <well_laid_lawn> clao: I make another script that uses xterm to start your script
[06:21] <jibbles> Leemp, a more advanced program to manage more programs through your terminal is screen, it is worth checking out
[06:21] <HermanDE_> Fanshawe, check out /etc/fstab
[06:22] <bastid_raZor> !fstab | Fanshawe
[06:22] <ubottu> Fanshawe: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions

[06:22] <Fanshawe> Awesome. Thank you all.
[06:22] <panthar__> screen is awesome
[06:23] <HermanDE_> Then you guys need to try splitvt....
[06:23] <nvclocknoob> i have installed nvclock, where is it?
[06:23] <HermanDE_> Why have multiple terminal windows, when a single one will do....
[06:23] <panthar__> screen is great for organizing multiple processes
[06:24] <colde89> maco: I have installed texlive-base, texlive-extra and texlive-xtex, but still get these error: ! Package inputenc Erroor: Unicode char \u8_ch not set up for use with Latex
[06:24] <HermanDE_> Screen is scriptable.....  ATD something to start at midnight in a screen....  Check the results in the morning.....
[06:24] <jibbles> HermanDE_, I suppose I am not 100% clear on the difference between a terminal, a shell, a terminal emulator, virtual terminal, etc...
[06:24] <maco> colde89: i dont know, i just know that the package i named before is the one that provides that package you were including
[06:25] <nvclocknoob> so noone here know anything about nvclock or where add/remove installs stuff like that/
[06:25] <Jeebs> wildbat: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/sS9XnNwi
[06:25] <rww> nvclocknoob: /usr/bin/nvclock?
[06:25] <colde89> maco: ok..
[06:25] <nvclocknoob> hmm
[06:25] <HermanDE_> jibbles, A shell is an execution environment.  This a command interpreter.
[06:25] <panthar__> cant say i've used it
[06:26] <Leemp> HermanDE_: I dunno, running into dependancy issues at the moment. I'll have to dig through this stuff tomorrow. "Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: python2.5-minimal (= 2.5.2-15+lenny1)"
[06:26] <HermanDE_> jibbles, A terminal usually refereed to access to a shell.
[06:26] <jkalex05> Im trying to install duke nukem 3d
[06:26] <Leemp> HermanDE_: And when trying to install minimal, it says a later version is already installed, so it won't install
[06:26] <jkalex05> i used command
[06:26] <jkalex05> wget http://apt.duke4.net/key/eduke32.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[06:26] <jibbles> ok, so a terminal connects the user (or process) to the shell (interpreter)
[06:26] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Yep....  You might want to try the version from Debian Squeeze....
[06:26] <jkalex05> it said wiritted to stout
[06:26] <jkalex05> now what?
[06:26] <Leemp> HermanDE_: Is that the latest?
[06:26] <HermanDE_> jibbles, That would be a good way.....
[06:27] <jkalex05> sorry im a linux noob
[06:27] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Yep.....
[06:27] <RedEvolution> Is anyone willing to help me configure my wireless adapter on 10.04?
[06:27] <Emry> Does anyone know where to adjust the settings for notify-osd? :P  All the info I see is to the effect of "Here is the spec" or a page saying "We want more notifications please" When honestly, I am wanting to make them less obtrusive. :)
[06:27] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Or you could try karmic....  Choices are wild....
[06:27] <wildbat> Jeebs,paste sudo fdisk -l
[06:27] <rww> Emry: as far as I know, there aren't any
[06:28] <jibbles> HermanDE_, if e.g. xterm is a X terminal emulator, what is a real terminal, and where is the object code or binary for it?
[06:28] <HermanDE_> jibbles, Most people confuse a terminal and a shell....  in most situations it can work as the same....
[06:28] <Leemp> HermanDE_: So what i'm seeing is i can expect failure heh. Would a better option simply be making my own packages?
[06:28] <Emry> rww: :/ I did see a notation saying that apparently the Kubuntu community is going a different direction with it.  If I can't alter it, and I can't remove it, then it basically leaves me two choices, and neither are optimal.
[06:28] <panthar__> whats wrong w/ ur wireles adaptor?
[06:29] <HermanDE_> jibbles, This goes into the history of Unix.....
[06:29] <jibbles> Erm, well I guess I can read about it :)
[06:29] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Sure.... That would be another method.....
[06:29] <rww> Emry: you can replace it with the notification-daemon package, which has GNOME's indicator system. That's what I ended up doing.
[06:29] <jkalex05> anyone know what im diong wrong?
[06:29] <Jeebs> wildbat: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/nHDTcjy6
[06:29] <rww> Emry: ( sudo aptitude install notification-daemon notify-osd_ )
[06:29] <PorkSoda> Guys/gals, I just upgraded a box to 10.04. It does not have the me menu like on another fresh install. How do I install it.
[06:29] <Jeebs> it's at the bottom of that paste, after the gparted information
[06:29] <PorkSoda> !memenu
[06:30] <HermanDE_> Leemp, Keep in mind that some Debian/Ubuntu packages are virtual....  In other words you try and install Python-2.5...  And it is only a referrer to other packages....
[06:30] <HermanDE_> Leemp, So, just find the root python packages......
[06:31] <wildbat> Jeebs, and mount -l?
[06:31] <jkalex05> im trying to install eduke32
[06:31] <Leemp> I'm still trying to figure out how a later version of python2.5-minimal is already installed. Something that shouldn't be, given that it's not in any ubuntu repos.
[06:31] <HermanDE_> jibbles, If you are running X in a terminal  (Yes, it is offically called a Graphic Terminal) ....  Any other terminal you are running is virtual through a real (X windows) terminal....
[06:31] <rww> HermanDE_: Please don't recommend users in here to add Debian repositories or use Debian repository packages. Mixing repositories is unsupported and causes packaging conflicts.
[06:31] <Emry> rww: does the notify-osd_ tell it to suppress that one? :P
[06:31] <jkalex05> I used wget to download it
[06:31] <jkalex05> now what do i do?
[06:31] <rww> Emry: it tells it to remove the package.
[06:31] <wildbat> Jeebs, sdc6 is ext4 already i think
[06:31] <Leemp> HermanDE_: Anyway, i give up for the night. I'll look into making my own packages. So far make/install has been the easiest route, go figure heh
[06:32] <HermanDE_> Leemp, That happens....  :)
[06:32] <jibbles> g'nite all!
[06:32] <Jeebs> wildbat: if it's ext4 already, shouldn't it still let me format it again?
[06:32] <Jeebs> Although gparted bicks it up as unknown
[06:32] <Jeebs> *picks
[06:33] <wildbat> Jeebs, if you mounted nopes
[06:33] <HermanDE_> rww, Any suggestions for someone asking about a package dropped by Ubuntu, but supported by other DEB based distros?
[06:33] <bullgard4> [Evolution 2.28.3] To mark a certain e-mail  as "Read" fails. It does not fail with 100 others. -- How to troubleshoot?
[06:33] <wildbat> Jeebs, or you have a corrupted partition table
[06:34] <rww> HermanDE_: python2.5 was dropped for a reason. The correct answer would be to find out that reason and explain it to the user.
[06:35] <Emry> rww: Hehehe.  apt-get just refused to do it at all without removing everything under the sun.  :P aptitude gave me a warning that ubuntu-desktop is broken and offered to remove it for me. ^^
[06:35] <Jeebs> it's not mounted
[06:35] <maco> Emry: try aptitude safe-upgrade
[06:35] <rww> Emry: heh, weird. They must have changed around the metapackage depends since the last time I looked at them. Sorry about that.
[06:36] <Jeebs> wildbat: it's not mounted
[06:36] <Jeebs> so it couldn't be in use
[06:36] <wildbat> Jeebs, ok try this ~ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc6 bs=4k count=1024
[06:36] <wildbat> Jeebs, then reboot
[06:37] <Guest31174> hey there you bun too!
[06:37] <nvclocknoob> wow system latency for my nvidia 5500 was set at 255 =c
[06:37] <rww> maco: that wouldn't help. There's a depend from ubuntu-desktop on notify-osd that I thought was on notification-daemon (which notify-osd provides). I think I got mixed up with gnome-* or something.
[06:38] <nvclocknoob> no wonder video lagged
[06:38] <HermanDE_> rww, Yep...  Looks like a distro decision over security....  bad answer for someone looking for a solution....
[06:38] <Jeebs> wildbat: reboot to the livecd and then try gparted again, I'm guessing?
[06:38] <feekill> wtf my wallpaper keeps switching back to the original xubuntu bg
[06:38] <rww> HermanDE_: It is, however, the correct one. Telling users to start using Debian repository packages is not.
[06:38] <Izinucs> nvclocknoob: where do you find that setting?
[06:38] <guohongsheng> Server LVM disk space, how clean and backup
[06:38] <wildbat> Jeebs, yes
=== root is now known as Guest76135
[06:39] <HermanDE_> rww, That is the freedom of using Linux....  Slack and RPMs are supported under Ubuntu.....
[06:39] <maco> HermanDE_: not officially... and not here
[06:39] <rww> !alien
[06:39] <ubottu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu uses !APT, not RPM. RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous and unsupported)
[06:39] <Jeebs> just wanna get this straight, as I'll have to install java again in the live os. Only have one internet enabled computer around me atm.
[06:39] <rww> Note the "quite dangerous and unsupported". Same applies to repo mixing.
[06:39] <HermanDE_> rww, Yea.....
[06:40] <Jeebs> live cd doesn't have a hidden irc client does it?
[06:40] <maco> Jeebs: yes, empathy
=== Andorin is now known as AK|out
[06:40] <Izinucs> Jeebs: nope but you can easily install irssi
[06:40] <rww> Jeebs: Try http://webchat.freenode.net/ . Empathy can do it, but it's a pain.
[06:40] <Guest31174> use xchat
[06:40] <Izinucs> sorry yep
[06:40] <HermanDE_> rww, a bot says so...  so it's wrong....  weird....
[06:40] <vu1kan> jeebs pidgin does irc
[06:40] <Jeebs> I'm using java.freenode.net atm
[06:40] <maco> vu1kan: pidgin isnt on the live cd
[06:40] <nvclocknoob> LZ i'm using powertweaks
[06:40] <Jeebs> jIRC is far superior to webchat :P
[06:41] <vu1kan> my bad, i haven't used a live cd since 8.04
[06:41] <Jeebs> alrighty. brb.
[06:41] <wildbat> Jeebs, just sudo apt-get install xchat
[06:41] <rww> Jeebs: assuming you enjoy wrestling with Java ;P
[06:41] <Emry> rww:  Not a problem.  If it boots next time I reboot, then it is unbroken enough. hehehehe
[06:41] <wildbat> xchat is far better then Java one
[06:41] <jkalex05> im trying to install eduke32 i used wget to download the gpg and it downloaded and said written to stdout
[06:41] <jkalex05> where is the game file going to be located
[06:42] <vu1kan> jkalex ~/.eduke32
[06:42] <yudi1> how do I pause the conversation screen from scrolling really quickly?  I want to go back and read few messages.
[06:43] <rww> yudi1: in Empathy? You don't. It's a known bug.
[06:44] <yudi1> rww: thank you, first time usin empathy, pidgin user
[06:45] <squig> does any one use cfengine3?
[06:45] <vu1kan> jkalex05 i used apt-get install eduke32, downloaded the shareware duke nukem 3d for the .wad;apt-get should unpack and install it for you, and to generate the directories you need to run eduke once
[06:45] <Shamoun> hey guys
[06:45] <Shamoun> what is the name of the graphical tool in ubuntu that controls startup services?
[06:46] <sashaluda> Hi, my ubuntu network manager doesn't list my mobile phone internet bluetooth connectoin, so how do i connect after creating Broad Band connection?

[06:47] <vu1kan> i'm not sure of the package name, lemme poke a bit in my sys
[06:47] <Shamoun> vu1kan, like what is the command it executes would be useful
[06:48] <vu1kan> Shamoun i've only ever launched it through the gui...but i'm looking in synaptic right now to find the package name
[06:48] <isw> anyone ever try to get 3 monitors working with ati's eyefinity & ubuntu?
[06:49] <Shamoun> vu1kan, thanks much appreciated, ive been struggling for hours now. i can get samba to start and work if i do sudo service smbd start at the command line, but when i enable it using rcconf or another tool it starts but doesn't work. so i want to do it with whatever ubuntu's built in system is
[06:49] <jkalex05> what is the codename for latest ubuntu
[06:49] <Jeebs> wildbat: I'm back!

[06:52] <Jeebs> wildcat: I installed xp last night with no hickups. I did actually try installing ubuntu before that (forgetting that installing xp after ubuntu is a god awful idea) and ubuntu was giving me the same error as now.

[06:54] <tarikk> hello
[06:54] <codexnn> hello
[06:55] <wildbat> Jeebs, just wipe the sdc2 and redo the extended ~ or wipe the whole disk , the gparted bef4 install winxp then ubuntu
[06:55] <clao> well_laid_lawn, got it to work, thanks anyway
[06:55] <well_laid_lawn> k
[06:55] <well_laid_lawn> clao:

[06:57] <rww> codexnn: that was just a command to have ubottu (our encyclopedia bot) send you a message. Read the message, and follow the instructions.
[06:57] <Jeebs> wildbat, no deal on wiping sdc2 and retrying the extended.
[06:58] <tarikk> sorry i got dropped b4. so yea ... i got a USB sd card reader.. dmesg is showing me [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk sg2 type 0... but i dont know how to mount it
[06:58] <wildbat> Jeebs, huh?
[06:58] <Jeebs> wildbat, So you think start the drive over again? it's not a huge hassle as I have nothing installed on xp yet.
[06:59] <tarikk> and fdisk -l is not showing it i dont think
[06:59] <wildbat> Jeebs, that's the faster way rather then debugging the problem
[06:59] <Jeebs> cool, so format the lot now, make my linux partion (but don't install linux), install xp and then install linux?
[06:59] <Jeebs> partition
[07:00] <musictoto> hi all! why is the 64-bit desktop download marked as 'not recommended for daily desktop usage' ?
[07:00] <wildbat> Jeebs, yes wipe the disk ~ partition it -> install xp > install ubuntu
[07:00] <maco> musictoto: because most people dont know if they have 32 or 64 bit computers
[07:00] <maco> musictoto: and if they go "oooh 64's a bigger number, that makes it better, right???" and it doesnt boot, they get not happy
[07:01] <rww> musictoto: because the people who rewrote the website text don't know what they're on about
[07:01] <codexnn> hey ,I have a problem with my wireless ,someone can help me/
[07:01] <cgethycx> hi, I have a creative sound blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer Fatal1ty Pro Series, and when I am not playing anything on my pc I hear static. Will better drivers fix this problem? If so where would I get them and how do I install?
[07:01] <Jeebs> wildbat: is there any particular order I should have the OS's on the disk (linux first or windows?)
[07:02] <musictoto> maco: rww: to know if your processor supports 32 bit rather than 64 bit is only a search away though ? that's the only reason ?
[07:02] <wildbat> Jeebs, windows first ,then ubuntu
[07:02] <rww> musictoto: yup. 64-bit works fine on 64-bit computers.
[07:02] <wildbat> Jeebs, after partitioning always reboot ^^b
[07:02] <maco> musictoto: it used to be that flash, java, and skype didnt work on 64bit, but thats not been the case in a couple of years
[07:02] <Jeebs> cool! :)
[07:03] <Jeebs> thanks heaps duder
[07:03] <wildbat> Jeebs, that'ss avoid many corruptio
[07:03] <maco> musictoto: and um most people dont know about googling for hardware. what would they even google for "dell computer amd64 or i386?"
=== JimmyJ_ is now known as JimmyJ
[07:03] <maco> musictoto: expecting people to know their cpu's model name is...expecting far far too much
[07:03] <musictoto> maco: although right now adobe doesn't offer flash for 64 bit...
[07:04] <ddrj> anyone here use a usb wifi card? specifically wusb100v2? the RT2870sta driver
[07:04] <maco> musictoto: but 32bit flash works fine on 64bit linux ;-)
[07:04] <wildbat> !wifi | ddrj
[07:04] <ubottu> ddrj: Wireless documentation, including how-to guides and troubleshooting information, can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[07:04] <Kinch2> from what I understand of 64-bit there are yet to be performance gains for the average user anyway
[07:04] <Emry> maco, Most people these days just have to look at the front of their machine and read the label. :P
[07:04] <musictoto> maco: ok.. in fact i thought 32 bit programs could be emulated, i wasn't sure though
[07:04] <Jeebs> the linux should be installed on primary or logical?
[07:05] <Kinch2> primary
[07:05] <ddrj> wildbat, yap already read it, but nothing concerning compiling mine on there x(
[07:05] <wildbat> ddrj, soory can't help then

[07:07] <musictoto> maco: ok thanks, that's all i need to know right now
[07:07] <Jeebs> alrighty, thanks, gonna reboot to start this partitioning.
[07:08] <musictoto> maco: maybe i'll come crying for help when the AMD64 machine is really here :)
[07:09] <vu1kan> Shamoun i'm not finding the specific package for the startup applications manager, but i think it's a dependancy of gnome-control-center - at least I can access the startup apps. through that

[07:20] <erry> And  im trying to go to live mode  to test and they panic
[07:20] <vu1kan> Shamoun have you tried adding your command to /ect/rc.local?
[07:20] <erry> wildbat, i tried ubuntu  and netbook remix
[07:20] <erry> they panic before they boot to live mode
[07:20] <Shamoun> vu1kan, nope, i don't know anything about what im doing. let me try that
[07:20] <indus> erry, try the alternate cd if it exists
[07:20] <erry> indus, it's not going to work
[07:21] <erry> I already told you if it can't run it's not going to install
[07:21] <indus> erry, try boot from usb then
[07:21] <wildbat> erry, that's not a good sign ~ you may have hardware issue ~ anyway paste the panic error up may be someone can help
[07:21] <erry> indus, that's what i'm trying to do
[07:21] <erry> wildbat, how do i paste it?
[07:21] <erry> the os never starts

[07:22] <indus> erry, but anyways, kernel panic is a problem with hardware detection when its booting live cd, i have been there
[07:22] <erry> indus, i tried wubi
[07:22] <erry> and it had the same  problem
[07:22] <indus> erry, my cd rom was on slave , i put it on master and solved my issue
[07:22] <indus> erry, ah wubi also ?
[07:22] <vu1kan> i think so, i'm pretty noobish myself, i just found that on the forums through google
[07:23] <erry> indus, kernel panic - not syncing: hwthreewire(): cmdreg: 0xff re|we bits are not clear!!!!
[07:23] <indus> erry, which netbook iks this ? try the regular ubuntu desktop edition, it works fine
[07:23] <erry> indus, i tried that
[07:23] <erry> indus, it has the exact same problem
[07:23] <erry> i thought netbook edition could fix it
[07:23] <indus> erry, netbook model, file a bug then  too
[07:23] <erry> indus, toshiba t110
[07:23] <indus> erry, but stick around for more help in any case
[07:24] <erry> i don't wanna file a bug
[07:24] <erry> i'll be rediculed when it's something simple
[07:24] <indus> erry, googled it ?
[07:24] <maco> erry: no you wont
[07:24] <erry> yeah
[07:24] <erry> lots of people having the prob
[07:24] <maco> erry: i have filed some *very* user-error bugs before
[07:24] <erry> no answer to them
[07:24] <erry> maco, i'll just get banned from reporting bugas
[07:24] <erry> bugs*
[07:24] <erry> i don't want that
[07:24] <maco> erry: no you wont
[07:25] <indus> erry, try disabling the wireless and try
[07:25] <indus> erry, i read that somewhere
[07:25] <erry> indus, how can i disable it?

[07:26] <Guest31174> erry, yeah we know
[07:26] <erry> sorry :(
[07:26] <indus> erry, but first , file a bug with ubuntu-bug casper
[07:26] <maco> erry: there's nothing wrong with being new :)
[07:26] <erry> everyoen calls you stupid
[07:26] <maco> erry: not around here they don't
[07:26] <rww> FloodBot3 does not accept your apologies!
[07:26] <maco> erry: if anyone in this channel ever calls you stupid, you type "!ops" and they'll likely get kicked for being jerks
[07:26] <Shamoun> vu1kan, thank you so much that worked perfectly
[07:26] <indus> erry, no body will ridicule youwhen you file a bug,
[07:26] <Shamoun> i was struggling for hours
[07:26] <Shamoun> anyway, im gonna go relax a bit now
[07:27] <erry> indus, it's probably just my netbook
[07:27] <Shamoun> vu1kan, thanks a ton mate
[07:27] <erry> it came with windows
[07:27] <indus> erry, see, first  the system searches automaticalyl for similar bugs
[07:27] <erry> ill buy 1 that comes with lkinux
[07:27] <vu1kan> Shamoun np, that's half of 'nix-helping each other out
[07:27] <erry> if i want linux
[07:27] <FloodBot3> erry: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[07:27] <maco> erry: most computers do come with windos ;-)
[07:27] <erry> maco, well this is windiows only ill just buy a linux 1 and it will be fixed
[07:27] <erry> And im gonna get banned from here again ;/
[07:28] <Jeebs> wildbat, I haven't tried formatting yet
[07:28] <Guest31174> there are too many bugs in ubuntu
[07:28] <vu1kan> erry have you tried to run a live cd on your netbook?
[07:28] <erry> vu1kan, yes
[07:28] <maco> erry: could do, but filing a bug at least helps get the bug fixed for other people who try to switch that model to running linux. you'll be helping the community overall :) really, devs WANT to know when something's broken, that way we can fix it rather than having people upset about the broken
[07:28] <Jeebs> but it has a little warning sign next to unallocated space that says... unrecognized disk label
[07:28] <erry> maco, maybe it works without wireless
[07:28] <[Screamo]> Anyone have one of the new ipod nanos?
[07:28] <erry> maco, see its wireless that fux it
[07:28] <erry> but i'd like to have wireless
[07:28] <erry> it would be nice
[07:28] <maco> erry: watch language in here....
[07:28] <indus> erry, ok found a similar issue
[07:28] <vu1kan> !ipod
[07:28] <ubottu> For information on how to sync and add tracks to your iPod, see the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IPodHowto - For the iPhone and the iPod Touch, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone - See !RockBox for information on liberating your iPod
[07:29] <erry> indus, i dont have an ipod
[07:29] <maco> erry: that was at [Screamo]
[07:29] <[Screamo]> :|
[07:29] <indus> lol
[07:29] <wildbat> Jeebs, you should have wipe the first 4M with dd command @@
[07:29] <erry> maco, can i turn wireless on later on?
[07:29] <[Screamo]> and it wasnt even indus that said it xD
[07:29] <indus> less sugar and more carrot juice helps
[07:29] <erry> cause i need it
[07:29] <[Screamo]> !rockbox
[07:29] <ubottu> rockbox is an open source firmware replacement for audio players from Archos, iRiver, Apple (iPod), and iAudio. See http://www.rockbox.org/ to get started!
[07:29] <maco> [Screamo]: hehe that too
[07:29] <erry> but i disabled it from the bios
[07:29] <indus> erry, here is your solution http://translate.google.co.in/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=http://viaxl.com/%3Ftag%3Dtoshiba&ei=VgYfTJ3yBoeWrAegp-HNCw&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCgQ7gEwAzgK&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhwthreewire%28%29:%2Bcmdreg:%2B0xff%2Bre%257Cwe%2Bbits%2Bare%2Bnot%2Bclear!!!!%26start%3D10%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dcom.ubuntu:en-US:official
[07:29] <Jeebs> so wait, what was that command again, and what does it do?
[07:29] <indus> oops
[07:29] <[Screamo]> meh
[07:29] <maco> erry: re-enable it in bios?
[07:29] <wildbat> Jeebs, do sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=4096 count=1024
[07:30] <erry> maco, but then it will crush ubuntu
[07:30] <[Screamo]> i had rockbox on both my ipod video and my 1st gen nano, but thats about as far as it goes (sadly)
[07:30] <[Screamo]> :(
[07:30] <Jeebs> yup, and I did that a minute ago
[07:30] <erry> indus, that's not my problem
[07:30] <Jeebs> before restarting
[07:30] <maco> erry: does it not boot with wireless enabled? i missed the start of what your bug is...
[07:30] <wildbat> Jeebs, i write the disk with zero
[07:30] <erry> maco, it panics with wireless enabled
[07:30] <indus> erry, that is exactly your problem
[07:30] <erry> works fine without it but i need wireless
[07:30] <erry> indus, i dont have an ipod!
[07:30] <maco> erry: yikes
[07:30] <wildbat> we did the first 4MB
[07:30] <indus> what the hell is this ipod comment
[07:31] <erry> indus, "Ubuntu Toshiba T100 plug headphones loud speaker next stop was the problem finally solved .."
[07:31] <erry> what does that have to do with my problem
[07:31] <jkalex05> i notice that my internet connection is slower on my ubuntu os than it is on windows
[07:31] <vu1kan> anybody know of software that could xfer to/from a sony walkman pmp(under ubuntu, of course)
[07:31] <indus> erry, scroll down my dear
[07:31] <jkalex05> whys that so?
[07:31] <erry> indus, down it says 'looking for  something?'
[07:31] <vu1kan> rockbox doesn't seem to support it, and neither does rhythmbox
[07:31] <[Screamo]> I dont see anything about the 5th gen nano
[07:31] <erry> indus, i'm not having a sound problem
[07:31] <indus> erry, no body will spoon feed you here
[07:31] <erry> I don't care about sound
[07:31] <indus> the problem is clearly mentioned in a few posts below
[07:31] <erry> i just want wireless

[07:32] <erry> can you please help me :(
[07:32] <erry> im a newbie
[07:32] <Jeebs> kk, so I tried to format
[07:32] <erry> I don't know chinese
[07:32] <erry> i'm sorry
[07:32] <maco> erry: the post in there that addresses your issue, i think, is: Toshiba T110 problems loading Ubuntu crash
[07:32] <erry> maco, i dont see that
[07:32] <wildbat> Jeebs, did it work?
[07:32] <maco> erry: so ctrl+F and look for "problems loading ubuntu crash" and itll take you to the bit about wireless
[07:32] <Jeebs> and it says it doesn't have a partition table atm. do I want to give it a ms-dos partition table?
[07:33] <maco> erry: you dont see that in the translation?
[07:33] <wildbat> yes
[07:33] <maco> erry: its nearly 1/2 way scrolled down
[07:33] <erry> maco, if i scroll down it's just black
[07:33] <nvclocknoob> so ubuntu already scales cpu freq?
[07:34] <maco> nvclocknoob: yes
[07:34] <Jeebs> wildbat, same deal. I'll try dropping that count
[07:35] <Shamoun> vu1kan, turns out it isn't fixed after all
[07:35] <sol1tude> hi, how can i do applications menu at desktop context menu? like in openbox
[07:36] <wildbat> Jeebs, hmmm ~ i think you have other issue ~ then....
[07:36] <R3cur51v3> I'm getting "WARNING: untrusted versions of the following packages will be installed!" when trying to install rpm utilities. How do I fix this?
[07:36] <nvclocknoob> soo how do i bring that info up..?
[07:36] <R3cur51v3> oh wait
[07:36] <R3cur51v3> nvm
[07:36] <vu1kan> Shamoun tsk...maybe try posting on ubuntuforums.org...you might have better luck finding out the name of the package there...it'll just take some time for a response
[07:36] <nvclocknoob> i have anbled support for it..and admin privlages
[07:36] <chenee_> can I use gprof to analyse my programmer which use the libjpeg?
[07:36] <SandGorgon> quick question - how does one use the 'find' command to find all filenames with png OR jpg OR bmp as the suffix
[07:36] <Shamoun> vu1kan, well the package is really unimportant. i just don't understand why this isn't working
[07:36] <R3cur51v3> I just needed to do aptitude update
[07:36] <R3cur51v3> sorry
[07:37] <Shamoun> because it is technically starting smbd and nmbd
[07:37] <nvclocknoob> but cpufreq still tells me there isnt support
[07:37] <Shamoun> and then rc.local is restarting them
[07:37] <Guest31174> SandGorgon, man find
[07:37] <Shamoun> but for some reason i can't connect from windows pcs
[07:37] <Shamoun> but if i execute service smbd restart
[07:37] <nvclocknoob> it's a p4 northwood 2.8
[07:37] <Shamoun> i can connect all of a sudden
[07:37] <Shamoun> there's no logical explanation
[07:38] <wildbat> Jeebs, may be you can try fdisk. it is not a GUI thou
[07:38] <vu1kan> weird...i've only been able to access my buddy's vista laptop using samba...it won't even see my xp desktop
[07:38] <R3cur51v3> wildbat, Jeebs, use cfdisk instead of fdisk
[07:38] <R3cur51v3> it's gui-esq
[07:39] <R3cur51v3> gui-esque
[07:39] <nvclocknoob> how do i know if ubuntu's native cpu scaling is working right?
[07:39] <R3cur51v3> nvclocknoob, sudo aptitude install cpufrequtils
[07:39] <vu1kan> shamoun which ver. of ubuntu are you using?
[07:39] <R3cur51v3> nvclocknoob, then do cpufreq-info
[07:39] <Jeebs> haha, could it have something to do with my sata controller?
[07:39] <R3cur51v3> nvclocknoob, alternately just type "cpufreq-info" and let it install it for you
[07:39] <Shamoun> vu1kan, xubuntu lucid
[07:40] <R3cur51v3> nvclocknoob, I hope it works out for you. I need to go to sleep. Later.
[07:40] <wildbat> R3cur51v3, no such package
[07:40] <v_v> hello. any one familiar with the ubuntu EnterPrise Cloud ?
[07:40] <R3cur51v3> wildbat, umm type cfdisk in a terminal
[07:40] <Shamoun> vu1kan, could it be a security thing
[07:40] <R3cur51v3> not that hard
[07:41] <Shamoun> vu1kan, maybe a firewalling thing, because i am running it with sudo its allowing it through
[07:41] <Guest31174> v_v, what do you want to know
[07:41] <Shamoun> but otherwise it wouldn't
[07:41] <nvclocknoob> ty
[07:41] <v_v> i want to try the Cloud, with one single machine, that means, both the cluster controller and the node are on the same machine
[07:41] <v_v> Guest31174: hi
[07:41] <nvclocknoob> where do i look for cpufreq drivers?
[07:41] <chang> So ga
[07:42] <v_v> Guest31174: i want to try the Cloud, with one single machine, that means, both the cluster controller and the node are on the same machine, is that possible ?
[07:43] <Jeebs> wildbat, so what am I getting fdisk to do, create a partition table?
[07:43] <wildbat> Jeebs, yea if you still have problem with the gparted
[07:43] <Guest31174> v_v, how do you want to try the Cloud, with one single machine, that means, both the cluster controller and the node are on the same machine, is that possible
[07:44] <donttrustem> Morning guy's trying to following this doc http://cumu.li/2008/5/13/recompiling-php5-with-bundled-support-for-gd-on-ubuntu  but I am getting this error http://pastebin.com/tSGVbuU2
[07:44] <Jeebs> okay!
[07:44] <wildbat> what kind of device is sdc? USB/ internal ?
[07:44] <nvclocknoob> how do i make my fat32 flash drives swap partitions?
[07:44] <wildbat> Jeebs, what kind of device is sdc? USB/ internal ?
[07:44] <nvclocknoob> yes?
[07:44] <wildbat> !swap | nvclocknoob
[07:44] <ubottu> nvclocknoob: swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[07:45] <Jeebs> wildbat, sata hdd
[07:45] <nvclocknoob> yes
[07:45] <nvclocknoob> i want all drives to have atleast 512mb swap useable
[07:45] <vu1kan> Shamoun it should be applying your userlevel to any startup scripts you've input...so the firewall shouldn't be an issue, try the steps here: http://embraceubuntu.com/2005/09/07/adding-a-startup-script-to-be-run-at-bootup/
[07:45] <wildbat> nvclocknoob, read the link ubottu give you
[07:46] <nvclocknoob> it won't click or highlight

[07:47] <daishadar> what's the best solution for automatic mounting/unmounting of usb drives for ubuntu server?
=== PhilippeD_ is now known as PhilippeD
[07:47] <Jeebs> wildbat, reckon you could help me with fdisk?
[07:48] <reyarth> #join /ubuntu.it
[07:48] <wildbat> Jeebs, use cfdisk ~ i think is easiler
[07:48] <vu1kan> daishadar this is the ubuntu channel, try your question in #ubuntu-server
[07:48] <Jeebs> "FATAL ERROR: Bad primary partition 0: Partition ends in the final partial cylinder"

[07:50] <wildbat> Jeebs, did you wipe the whole disk?
[07:50] <Jeebs> d/w worked it out
[07:50] <Jeebs> Um no >_>
[07:50] <Jeebs> Should?
[07:50] <wildbat> Jeebs, just thpught you did nvm then
[07:51] <Davin> So, having deleted an unneccessary partition to then add an extended drive to contain two partitions for installing Ubuntu, I can no longer get Windows 7 to boot. Trying stuff but can't seem to get anything to stick
[07:51] <vislumbrante> hey guys morning, afternoon, evining

[07:52] <vislumbrante> is there any soft to make updare
[07:53] <vislumbrante> for others soft?
[07:53] <phawx> gah.  something happened, and my Places and System menus disappeared from my panel...how do i get em back?
[07:55] <vu1kan> phawx rightclick your panel, click 'add to panel...' add the 'menu bar'
[07:55] <vu1kan> phawx or the 'main menu'...i prefer that, it's smaller
[07:55] <blekos> hello, how can I connect to windows server with remote desktop (not VNC)
[07:56] <vu1kan> Shamoun i'm not having much luck with google here, maybe restate your question for the room and someone more experianced can help?
[07:56] <kraut> moin
[07:56] <Beyecixramd> blekos: Linux has an application for remote desktop, for Windows machines, but i don't remember its name
[07:56] <Beyecixramd> blekos: search in the repos (Synaptic) please
[07:56] <Lint01> Davin, had you use Windows or Linux to delete & create them?
[07:56] <Shamoun> vu1kan, alright, thanks for all the help anyway. i really appreciate it
[07:56] <maco> Beyecixramd: vinagre?
[07:56] <Beyecixramd> maco: quoting himself "not VNC"
[07:57] <maco> Beyecixramd: oh
[07:57] <phawx> thanks vu1
[07:57] <phawx> vu1kan, even
[07:57] <maco> Beyecixramd: terminal services client?
[07:57] <Shamoun> i have a xubuntu lucid install running samba as a server. when i boot xubuntu client pcs are unable to connect to it, but if i do service smbd restart; service nmbd restart they can connect just fine
[07:57] <Shamoun> any ideas?
[07:57] <vu1kan> Shamoun i'll keep lookin while i can, if i come across something i'll let ya know
[07:57] <Beyecixramd> maco: sounds more like it... blekos, try what maco said ^
[07:57] <nvclocknoob> so if i want a physical drive (flash) to be a swap i have to use a partition manager?
[07:58] <blekos> i think is gnome-rdp :)
[07:58] <Lint01> blekos, RDP support in Linux is very outdated
[07:58] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: what do you mean by "physical drive"?
[07:58] <alex87> does anyone know where i can find the 64 bit flash beta?
[07:58] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: all drives are physical from what i know... except cloud HDDs...
[07:58] <nvclocknoob> there are files..made to be used as swap..then a physical drive partitioned as a swap
[07:58] <blekos> hm, but I need to connect to Server 2003...
[07:59] <Beyecixramd> alex87: if it isn't in the official website (Adobe) you won't find it
[07:59] <Davin> Lint01, I had used Windows 7 to delete the partition, then I'd gone to GParted to add it back in, but even though I deleted it in Windows 7, it was still listed as a partition when I went in with GParted, so I deleted it that way, then replaced it with the extended partition
=== [1]sassyn is now known as sassyn
[07:59] <nvclocknoob> physical drives are much faster and less demnding then having multiple swaps on one drive
[07:59] <alex87> Beyecixramd, they've just removed it. i'm wondering if anyone has the file, or if i can get it anywhere else online
[07:59] <blekos> there is remotedesktop client as well
[08:00] <nvclocknoob> is there a win7 thats free still?
[08:00] <bodzilla> no
[08:00] <shawncm217> blekos: Terminal Server Client (tsclient) is installed by default in my 10.04 install. Have you tried it?
[08:00] <nvclocknoob> =c
[08:00] <alex87> hehe, that's not how windows works
[08:00] <blekos> no...
[08:00] <nvclocknoob> my xp partition is fawked
[08:00] <bodzilla> w7 has a free 30 day trail
[08:00] <nvclocknoob> =c
[08:00] <blekos> aha
[08:00] <Beyecixramd> bodzilla: trail... why would i want a trail... :D
[08:00] <nvclocknoob> it's like $250
[08:01] <blekos> why is not listed in any menu?
[08:01] <bodzilla> Because I can't speel
[08:01] <Beyecixramd> bodzilla: chemtrails! i say
[08:01] <nvclocknoob> that's absolutely greedy man
[08:01] <bodzilla> Home W7 new egg100$
[08:01] <nvclocknoob> -.-
[08:01] <bodzilla> upgrade though
[08:02] <v_v> bodzilla: W7 means Windows 7 ?
[08:02] <nvclocknoob> yes
[08:02] <bodzilla> yes
[08:02] <alex87> so no-one has a 64 bit version of flash lying around?
[08:02] <Lint01> Unlike Linux, W7 supports 3D acceleration, for DirectX at least
[08:02] <nvclocknoob> why dont you d/l it from depo or adobe?
[08:02] <UnclaimedBaggage> Hi folks. I'm trying to get started with a later version of rails than is in the (10.04) repository via a gem install...but when I go to run the 'rails' command, the repos jumps in with a 'the program rails is currently not installed' error. Any idea how to get that repos command out of the way and recognising the installed gem? 'Gem list' confirms the rails gem is indeed installed
[08:02] <nvclocknoob> ubuntu now supports dx and 3d gfx
[08:02] <alex87> nvclocknoob, it's no long available
[08:02] <shawncm217> blekos: If that was a response to me, I see it under "Internet."
[08:02] <nvclocknoob> atleast in wine
[08:03] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: dx as in DirectX?
[08:03] <nvclocknoob> yes
[08:03] <phawx> Anyone running a Dell with the integrated laptop?
[08:03] <Davin> Lint01, if the method for setting up the new partition was where I went wrong, I can restore the laptop I'm working with back to factory settings if thres a different way it needs to be done to work
[08:03] <phawx> err
[08:03] <nvclocknoob> 3d fx is also driver/hw dependant
[08:03] <phawx> Integrated Webcam
[08:03] <nvclocknoob> but linux can be made to support 3dfx
[08:03] <nvclocknoob> gfx
[08:03] <chang> Is there any good way to crypt the infomation we submit in the webbrowser except SSL?
[08:03] <blekos> aaaa, yes., yes... I am bit of newbie in using linux :)
[08:03] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: DirectX is propietary, Windows only... Linux will never support it unless Microsoft makes it support it
[08:03] <Lint01> Davin, what exactly happens when you boot WIn7?
[08:03] <nvclocknoob> ubuntu seems to make this easier as long as someone took the time to write/build good drivers
=== [1]sassyn is now known as sassyn
[08:04] <Beyecixramd> chang: SSH, or public GPG keys
[08:04] <nvclocknoob> exactly bey
[08:04] <Beyecixramd> chang: better: VPN
[08:04] <nvclocknoob> but there are modules in wine..so it can be done
[08:04] <shawncm217> blekos: Me too! When I saw your question, I had to search myself.
[08:04] <Lint01> How to enable OpenGL acceleration in Linux?
[08:04] <nvclocknoob> it's not native no xD i wasnt saying that
[08:04] <blekos> !!!
[08:04] <blekos> glad you were around to find it ;)
[08:04] <nvclocknoob> most gfx cards already suppot opengl
[08:05] <nvclocknoob> if the software needs or uses opengl and they coded it right it will be using opengl extentions
[08:05] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: why would we want DirectX when there's OpenGL? (which is FAR SUPERIOR, for example, avatar was rendered on a cloud of Ubuntu servers, on OpenGL)
[08:05] <chang> Thanks to Beyecixramd!Ok, I'll try to find some information about SSH & VPN
[08:05] <nvclocknoob> check the software your using (like games) settings
[08:05] <Lint01> The Mesa OpenGL driver is using software rendering, most likely your OpenGL drivers haven't been installed correctly <-- WTF is that?
[08:06] <nvclocknoob> was it opengl 2.0?
[08:06] <Beyecixramd> Lint01: you need to install a package to allow 3D rendering
[08:06] <Lint01> Beyecixramd, which one?
[08:06] <nvclocknoob> your using restricted drivers
[08:06] <nvclocknoob> and yes anything other then directx is superior
[08:06] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: too sad people keep coding for DX :(
[08:07] <nvclocknoob> opengl is on the gfx card natively
[08:07] <Lint01> nvclocknoob, like DX
[08:07] <nvclocknoob> meaning less lag etc much much faster
[08:07] <nvclocknoob> dx is software only and uses cpu most of the time
[08:07] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: that's not true...
[08:07] <nvclocknoob> and has to refrence files on the hd..
[08:08] <nvclocknoob> shaders lighting textures.. if not hw supported by dx codeing..is software
[08:08] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: if it was software only, i wouldn't be able to run Crysis on my dual core, 2'66 Ghz at 30 FPS in high settings
[08:08] <Davin> Lint01, Im going right into Windows Error Recovery and Windows Boot Manager. Boot Manager info "The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible."
[08:08] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: and Nexuiz (OpenGL) runs at more or less the same speed with the same quality
[08:08] <nvclocknoob> a dual core would be able to run crysis with an onboard...
[08:08] <DrSuess> i was wondering since Ubuntu is picking up in popularity, are Virus picking up as well, i know there are not many around, anyone know if we need a scanner, if so, what too use?
[08:09] <intmed> how to mount the drives automatically at startup. i am using ubuntu 10.04
[08:09] <nvclocknoob> and if you have a video or onboard that support most of what i mentioned  in hw..then yur card does the work
[08:09] <nvclocknoob> yes
[08:09] <Lint01> DrSuess, don't worry, it's 1.2% still
[08:09] <nvclocknoob> yes you need fw and scanner
[08:09] <Beyecixramd> DrSuess: Viruses don't act in Linux like they do in Windows. Calm down, you're fully safe
[08:10] <nvclocknoob> linux has recently been used in a ddos to shut down my win pc..
[08:10] <nvclocknoob> yes you need protection
[08:10] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: sorry, but you did something stupid then :)
[08:11] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: in Windows, even if you don't touch a key, as soon as you're online, you're vulnerable
[08:11] <nvclocknoob> regardless of doing something stupid...it was a vulnerability
[08:11] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: in Linux, it needs your password and such
[08:11] <Davin> Lint01 I did also try, after Windows 7 stopped booting, actually installing Ubuntu on the partition I'd already set up for it to see if that might get around it, which didn't work and might've been a bad plan. Start Up Repair can't seem to fix it, either
[08:11] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: i can also program a bash script to erase my hard drive, and would that be a vulnerabilty?
[08:12] <nvclocknoob> the linux pc in my network..was used as well as hundreds of win and linux pc's...they did not need root
[08:12] <Lint01> Beyecixramd, it needs no password if kernel has privilege escalation vulnerability
[08:12] <intmed> someone pls help
[08:12] <nvclocknoob> somehow they made a new profile in xp and made their own process
[08:12] <Beyecixramd> Lint01: obviously
[08:12] <nvclocknoob> flooded ram
[08:12] <nvclocknoob> and used syn packets to mess things up too
[08:12] <wise_crypt> <<< nmap: nexthost: failed to determine route to << any one ever got this ?
[08:12] <nvclocknoob> linux has native syn packet protections..somewhat
[08:13] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: you'll see anyway, that the rate of linux infection is lower than the rate of windows infections
[08:13] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: if you're on Windows, without antivirus, bye bye
[08:13] <Beyecixramd> in linux without antivirus, you're safer
[08:13] <Lint01> nvclocknoob, Windows has no SYN fllod problems since 1997, stop raving
[08:14] <nvclocknoob> yea well they persisted in shutting down norton,mcaffe,comodo,avast,avira,zonealarm..and then blocked the install of any known fw/anti-v software
[08:14] <nvclocknoob> lint win is vulnerably to a multitude of attacks
[08:14] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: see? antivirus are useless
[08:14] <nvclocknoob> new ones every second
[08:14] <nvclocknoob> i can probably pulle up a log..
[08:14] <Lint01> nvclocknoob, stop spreading FUD
[08:14] <nvclocknoob> ...
[08:14] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: anyway, yes, stop
[08:15] <nvclocknoob> i am letting people know..yes you need protection regardless of os..
[08:15] <cgethycx> how do I permanently mount a network drive
[08:15] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: no...
[08:15] <nvclocknoob> many hackers use diffrent tactics..some don't even use a traditional os..
[08:15] <vu1kan> but how does that relate to ubuntu?
[08:15] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: at least not the same way as in Windoww
[08:15] <Beyecixramd> Windows*
[08:15] <v_v> hello. i try to create a usb boot with the ubuntu  startup disk creator. it tells me my usb stick needs to be formatted. so i just click the 'format' button, and nothing happened...
[08:16] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: in windows, you can use trojans, worms, etc, in linux you need to hack a bit
[08:16] <Lint01> he must be telling about Windows 2000 SP1, which he torrented back in 2001
[08:16] <nvclocknoob> i see no diffrence in methods of attacks between os's and vulnerabilies..only reason linux has protections is cause people know what to protect..and make it so
[08:16] <vu1kan> !ot
[08:16] <ubottu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics. Thanks!
[08:17] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: Ubuntu has AppArmor, Fedora has SELinux, proactive protections, you know?
[08:17] <nvclocknoob> and yes linux requires skill to bypass
[08:17] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: it won't allow malware do dirty stuff
[08:17] <Lint01> Beyecixramd, it's very hard to launch something from the net in Windows, actually
[08:17] <EvilTrek> !ot | Beyecixramd and nvclocknoob:
[08:17] <ubottu> Beyecixramd and nvclocknoob:: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics. Thanks!
[08:17] <nvclocknoob> oo how do i configure apparmor to be more aggressive then?
[08:17] <wise_crypt> Lint01: ?
[08:17] <Beyecixramd> Lint01: i know, i know, but way easier than in Linux
[08:17] <EvilTrek> er
[08:17] <EvilTrek> Lint01: ^^
[08:17] <EvilTrek> at Ubottu's msg
[08:18] <nvclocknoob> .. um someone asked a question in support.. i am answering it
[08:18] <wise_crypt> <<< nmap: nexthost: failed to determine route to << any one ever got this ?
[08:18] <Lint01> wise_crypt, what ?
[08:18] <nvclocknoob> and then others are saying..no no.. leave your system wide open -.-
[08:18] <EvilTrek> nvclocknoob:  it was an accidential highlight
[08:18] <nvclocknoob> xd
[08:18] <EvilTrek> anyways
[08:18] <nvclocknoob> xD
[08:18] <nvclocknoob> sry
[08:18] <EvilTrek> if you are going to argue this point, take the arguing to #ubuntu-offtopic or elsewhere
[08:19] <nvclocknoob> i'm not argueing it's a discussion relevent to support?
[08:19] <cgethycx> how do I permanently mount a network drive
=== gui is now known as Guest15196
=== Guest15196 is now known as kryl
[08:19] <Beyecixramd> cgethycx: /etc/fstab
[08:19] <Lint01> "The Mesa OpenGL driver is using software rendering, most likely your OpenGL drivers haven't been installed correctly" <-- WTF is that? and how to fix it?
[08:20] <squig> Lint01, you need to install hardware drivers for your graphics card
[08:20] <nvclocknoob> lint..look for drivers for your hw..using synaptic..
[08:20] <nvclocknoob> then enable hw accel
[08:20] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: hw accel should be auto enabled, at least with Intel, nVidia, and ATi after installing drivers
[08:21] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: that is: restart X or reboot
[08:21] <cgethycx> command not found?
[08:21] <nvclocknoob> i had to install my nvida then enable it =/
[08:21] <erry> Hello
[08:21] <ravn> hi folks, anyone have experience in sending rythmbox streams (or even better spotify) to an apple air port express unit (I have seen some 4 years old posts, but they are kino tweaks, would be nice with more regular solution)
[08:21] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: really? :S
[08:21] <erry> I need to install a dri9verwith ndiswrapper
[08:21] <Beyecixramd> nvclocknoob: installed from the Ubuntu repos, and etc?
[08:21] <megasega> kernel panic - how to fix? any takers?
[08:21] <erry> but it wont do
[08:21] <erry> megasega, yeah disable wireless
[08:21] <erry> and then do some shit
[08:21] <nvclocknoob> yea, then i needed a 3rd party resolution changers..
[08:21] <erry> -_--
[08:21] <FloodBot3> erry: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:22] <Beyecixramd> megasega: depends on what kernel panic is... most of them are hw-related, which means you need to change hardware to make it work
[08:22] <nvclocknoob> at first it didnt detect my monitor...
[08:22] <Guest31174> anyone tried ubuntu one
[08:22] <Guest31174> is it any good
[08:22] <nvclocknoob> now it's fine =/
[08:22] <nvclocknoob> and nvclock has it o/ced
[08:22] <nvclocknoob> xD
[08:22] <megasega> well on 10.04 - installed ubuntu via CD - then downloaded the kernel sources - then copied the vmlinuz - reboot - panic!
[08:22] <Beyecixramd> ravn: zero experience, but RB has a streaming server from what i know. DLNA, and UPnP iirc
[08:23] <Beyecixramd> megasega: that's hardware related, definitely
[08:23] <squig> Beyecixramd, what is RB?
[08:23] <nvclocknoob> right now i'm trying to find cpufreq drivers for my northwoord 2.8
[08:23] <megasega> I think it has to do with grub not having a menu.lst
[08:23] <Beyecixramd> squig: Rhytmbox
[08:23] <Guest31174> anyone tried ubuntu one
[08:23] <Guest31174> is it good
[08:24] <Beyecixramd> Guest31174: it's good, yeah, please change your nick using /nick yournewnick
