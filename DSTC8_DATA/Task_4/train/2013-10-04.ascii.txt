[05:46] <Paulus68_1> serapath: can you check if your laptop/pc is listed here http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/catalog/component/pci/8086:1e20/
[05:46] <tech2> Dr_Willis: the ppa was disabled, but the installed packages were still present. Thanks, looks like ppa-purge is fixing it.
[05:47] <l624> Any installed ubunt on Phone?
[05:47] <Dr_Willis> tech2:  odd that the ppa had a newer one then the updated release. :)

[05:48] <tech2> Dr_Willis: bluez, the kernel, there's a few. In this case it was a snapshots repo for vim, so I'm not _too_ surprised.
[05:48] <l624> thanks wills
[05:53] <Paulus68_1> serapath: sorry I'm running out of options here
[05:53] <Dr_Willis> gotta have the latest vim ;) they are always adding so many new features.  heh.

[05:54] <serapath> would it be a solution to install arch instead of ubuntu?
[05:54] <Dr_Willis> heh - i always 'find' answers on the archlinux wiki also.
[05:54] <serapath> sounds as if it works with arch
[05:54] <Dr_Willis> often the answers can be used on ubuntu
[05:54] <Xeeshu> Morning!
[05:54] <Hundred> howdy :)
[05:54] <Dr_Willis> but its weird that intel stuff is not working.  normally Intel hardware is very problem free
[05:55] <serapath> i have no 3d
[05:56] <serapath> this is one of the things i hate most
[05:56] <serapath> drivers not working
[05:56] <Dr_Willis> thers only 3 questions in total about the ideapad g580 on askubuntu.com
[05:56] <serapath> this is the single most important issue that always made me go back to windows
[05:56] <serapath> and i'm already thinking about just uninstalling ubuntu and go back to win7
[05:57] <serapath> win7 works like a charm
[05:57] <Dr_Willis> intel does have their 'latest drivers installer tool' at that 01.org site i recall. and theres the xorg edgers ppa.
[05:57] <OY1R> serapath, i feel your pain, just hang on in there.
[05:57] <serapath> every time i try ubuntu, which is maybe every 12 to 24 months.... its the same sad experience
[05:58] <Dr_Willis> Hmm. This guys G580 has a differnt wireless card then what you said you had above.
[05:58] <serapath> for example, in windows i have the hardware manager displaying all my hardware and wether it has the newest drivers installed or whether there is a problem with it
[05:58] <serapath> why is there not such a thing in ubuntu? or is there?
[05:58] <Dr_Willis> the drivers are normally all built into the kernel. so its actualy only a few cases that you update just the 'drivers'
[05:59] <Dr_Willis> totally differnt design philsoply then how wondows does it
[05:59] <OY1R> iirc the hardware manager in Windows shows what hardware is installed based on the drivers installed.
[05:59] <serapath> even if it hadnt all the drivers, at least i would know what to look for and when it works... second: i cant install chrome from the software center, same with brackets, same with sublime.. i could do it with apt-get, but then i only can start it from console and its not added to my "shortcut bar"
[06:00] <Dr_Willis> Ive definatly had the windows hardware manager be brain dead. "insert driver disk for 'generic pci wireless card'"  great. ;)
[06:00] <gulag2013> chrome no , chromium-browser is in the software center
[06:00] <serapath> Dr_Willis: i had that too, but those times are gone since windows vista, stayed gone with win7 and havent come back with win8
[06:00] <Dr_Willis> as for sublime. - the sublime faq. and i think the omgubuntu, and/or webupd8 blog site mention getting an icon launcher for it.
[06:00] <serapath> the last time that stuff occured was winXP
[06:01] <Dr_Willis> serapath:  i had it happen with windows 7 just a few weeks ago. ;)
[06:01] <serapath> ok
[06:01] <Dr_Willis> but it was a very very cheap bit of hardware. ;)
[06:01] <serapath> is there another distribution that would more easily solve this automatically?
[06:01] <Dr_Willis> as for google chrome. I think you just go get the deb from the google homepage. and i normally do a 'sudo gdebi chrome.deb' and it sets it up
[06:01] <serapath> maybe linux mint_
[06:01] <serapath> ?
[06:02] <Hundred> yeah mint is good
[06:02] <Dr_Willis> serapath:  go try them and see. we cant keep track of all the other disretos
[06:02] <Hundred> serpawhat cpu you have? jw
[06:02] <Dr_Willis> Most intel drivers are built into the kernel and X with the open sourced drivers.  so its unusual that intel hardwre has issues.
[06:03] <Hundred> like what kind if intel cpu? jw
[06:03] <Dr_Willis> if any other disrto was using the exact same kernel version, and exact same X version. i would expect the same issues. If its a kernel/X issue

[06:10] <tehrealjared> Wow thanks
[06:10] <Hundred> yeah serapath try out linux mint, you'll like it since it is more similar to windows, ubuntu is more similar to mac
[06:11] <serapath> Hundred: hahaha, ubuntu isnt similar to mac in the slightest. that's a joke, right?
[06:11] <Dr_Willis> i dont find ubuntu similer to mac at all. . ;)
[06:11] <Dr_Willis> and mint is more closer to the old gnome2 i belive.
=== Mayazcherquoi is now known as Mayzie
[06:12] <OY1R> i installed mint 13 on my stationary pc. works great.
[06:12] <serapath> actually, what i currently miss the most is two things: 1. all drivers/hardware work out of the box, 2. awesome hotkeys for my GUI
[06:12] <Hundred> yeah its becoming really popular now for some reason
[06:13] <serapath> is there another popular distro beside ubuntu and mint?
[06:13] <serapath> that just work?
[06:13] <OY1R> i'd like Ubuntu on there but unity put me off, hence Mint.
[06:13] <serapath> ...or at least are supposed to just work?
[06:13] <OY1R> serapath, distro that just works is Ubuntu. (99% of the time)
[06:13] <Dr_Willis> from what ive been googling ubuntu just works on that g580 for most people
[06:14] <Dr_Willis> im finding very few people having issues with it
[06:14] <OY1R> more like >99.5%
[06:14] <Dr_Willis> but it could be theres differnt variants
[06:14] <serapath> OY1R cant be true, because during my life time, i tried ubuntu at least 6 times and always went back to windows. between each time,there was around 12 to 24 months
[06:15] <serapath> and it NEVER worked out of the box
[06:15] <Dr_Willis> go hit up disrtowatch and grab some iso's make some live usb's and test them out
[06:15] <serapath> so 99% is a joke too :-) its statistically impossible that i have so much bad luck
[06:15] <serapath> :P
[06:15] <toothe> so, I have grub running now
[06:15] <Dr_Willis> or theres somthing screwy with that laptop. :)
[06:15] <toothe> but...that's all I have running. I have no kernel options.

[06:18] <Dr_Willis> elemantry os - is worth looking at also if you want to test

[06:40] <SoItBegins2> In XOrg.0.log, the (EE) lines for the trackpad/kb failure are as follows:

[06:41] <SoItBegins2> [  3406.848] (EE) synaptics: bcm5974: Synaptics driver unable to detect protocol
[06:42] <SoItBegins2> And then the trackpad is redetected. But it's still a great pain, because the trackpad and keyboard are then offline for a span of up to a minute before the computer redetects it.
[06:42] <SoItBegins2> Anyone have ideas on this?
[06:43] <Dr_Willis> SoItBegins2:  has it done this in other disrtos also? from differnt live cds?
[06:44] <SoItBegins2> I don't know about other distros, but it does not do it on Mac OS X 10.6. It did do it in the version of Ubuntu 11 I upgraded from.
[06:45] <Dr_Willis> id test it with a newer live cd if you can . if a 12.04 live  cd has the same issues. that would point to a 12.04 kernel issue/bug.
[06:45] <Dr_Willis> if it works however. that would point to some odd quirk with the upgrade process
[06:45] <helmut_> hi
[06:45] <SoItBegins2> I'm running 12.04 now. The bug happens in both 11 and 12.04

[06:50] <Dr_Willis> yes from a live cd.
[06:51] <SoItBegins2> Ah, OK. Thanks.
[06:51] <Dr_Willis> that would narrow it down to a 'upgrade issue' or not
[06:51] <Dr_Willis> id even test with a 13.0x or 13.10 live cd
[06:52] <mihir_> what tool is used by ubuntu to do the software update, does it use wget to download the files in background?
[06:52] <Dr_Willis> if all those have the same issue. Id then try a radically differnt  disrto like Fedora or arch
[06:52] <Dr_Willis> mihir_:  i think it uses curl.   do a 'ps ax' and see whts running as it downloads somthing
[06:53] <mihir_> ok
[06:53] <Dr_Willis> when in doubt, explore the os. ;)
[06:54] <aeon-ltd> SoItBegins2: long shot... is there such thing as a kb/m sleep function?

[06:56] <SoItBegins2> Well, I have got one of the ones with the backlit keyboard.
[06:56] <SoItBegins2> Dunno what it is you're describing, though-- when the KB and trackpad go out, external keyboards and mice still work perfectly.
[06:57] <SoItBegins2> Be right back.

[06:59] <SoItBegins2> Ah, the famous ribbon cable problem. I actually had that happen to me, but fixed it; this intermittency problem does not occur in Mac OS X, possibly as a testament to that.
[07:00] <Dr_Willis> or it is just revovering faster
[07:00] <Dr_Willis> recovering
[07:00] <SoItBegins2> Well, the ribbon cable problem doesn't recover until you 'unplug' and 'replug' it, which is what the cable is.
[07:01] <Dr_Willis> i mean the os sees and reloads/resets the hardware driver or whatever faster when it sees it disconnect/reconnect
[07:01] <SoItBegins2> If I'm reading the log right, I think this is a software problem where the trackpad driver zones out and then catches itself.

[07:30] <atossava> gordonjcp: that is generally good advice :)
[07:30] <atossava> Composite and nVidia hardware overlay don't play together, and I need the HW overlay for something

[07:31] <Dr_Willis> composite can normally be turned on and off on the fly i thought from most desktops

[07:31] <SoItBegins2> but the little caps lock light DOES.

[07:32] <Dr_Willis> theres other compositing window managers out there  that can turn it on/off on the fly.
[07:32] <atossava> dr_willis: perhaps so, but this is the default, and it's been OK for me until now

[07:34] <Dr_Willis> it all depends on what you need the sysem to do
[07:34] <atossava> light is not an issue, but surviving without Composite (which is a requirement for nVidia Option "Overlay" to work) is
[07:34] <Dr_Willis> what sort of overlay do you mean? i cant recall ever needing to mess with it befor
[07:35] <Dr_Willis> kde can definatly turn compositing on and off on the fly.
[07:36] <atossava> Dr_Willis: I have an application on Solaris that needs a 8bit pseudocolor overlay.  In the regular case, trying to start it up results in a coredump on the Sun.  The only X terminal with which it works effortlessly is another Sun, or a SGI.  It might have worked with the AcceleratedX server from Xi Graphics.
[07:37] <atossava> I do have ten SGIs... in the basement, and some of them might even be in working condition.
[07:37] <Dr_Willis> im so old.. i actually rember sun workstations and the Xi X server. ;)
[07:37] <SoItBegins2> And oddly enough, with the caps lock light (but not caps lock) on, the keyboard and mouse seem to be working perfectly.
[07:38] <atossava> Dr_Willis: Well, needing to run a Solaris app pretty much dates me, doesn't it. :)

[07:39] <atossava> I've got the overlays enabled and Composite is not in the way. It does not work.
[07:39] <Dr_Willis> radio? Luxery! ;)
[07:39] <atossava> So I've been wasting my time, but I needed to know that. :)

[07:39] <Dr_Willis> back to the drawing board then eh.
[07:40] <Dr_Willis> multiplexed serial terminal   (using dnet on my amiga) at 9600 baud in college/ :)  i was so leet back then.
[07:40] <atossava> Back to the SGI stash in order to get a real X terminal going. :)
[07:42] <atossava> re-enable Composite, disable Overlay, install ubuntu-desktop, get things back to whatever counts as normal... :D

[08:10] <Dr_Willis> ping some server like 'ping 8.8.8.8' in a terminal and see f that works
[08:10] <Dr_Willis> theres some known issues with wifi cards and powersaveing modes disconnecting  if the connection is not used after some time
[08:11] <jack---> Dr_Willis, that works but doesnt keep my connction up
[08:11] <jack---> disconnects anyway
[08:12] <Dr_Willis> thats weird
[08:12] <jack---> yup :/
[08:12] <Guest21795> any known problems with qtcreator <-> gdb after last 13.10 updates?
[08:12] <Dr_Willis> so it pings for about 20 sec. then pings start failing
=== Xeeshu is now known as Guest28345
[08:12] <jack---> like that, yeah
[08:13] <Dr_Willis> id cget the exact chipset that dongle is using. and check the forums and askubuntu.com there might be some known work arounds
[08:14] <jack---> ok, will try that
[08:18] <crankharder> anyone know where errors from upstart init scripts end up?
[08:20] <Dr_Willis> in /var/log somewehere i imagine
[08:20] <Dr_Willis> you can tail -f /lots/of files and watch them all ;)
[08:20] <Dr_Willis> i recall other log watchers also. some with color. but havent used them in ages
[08:21] <crankharder> var/log/upstart ;)
[08:22] <Dr_Willis> how logical ;)
[08:22] <Dr_Willis> in windiwz it would be some weird place i bet ;)
[08:23] <viaSanctus_> I'm at a client and I have a problem ubuntu box
[08:23] <viaSanctus_> nothing I do frees up any space on the hard drive
[08:23] <viaSanctus_> typically linux
[08:23] <cfhowlett> viaSanctus_, error messages?
[08:23] <Dr_Willis> check the log files  in /var/log and the users home.
[08:23] <viaSanctus_> none
[08:23] <viaSanctus_> I have 0 bytes free
[08:23] <Dr_Willis> ive seen log files grow for weird reasons to huge size due to error messages
[08:24] <viaSanctus_> and need to free just a meg or so
[08:24] <crankharder> it really hates a call to /usr/bin/test :(  just seems to stop the script dead
[08:24] <Dr_Willis> and they grow as fast as you free space
[08:24] <viaSanctus_> can I delete the src / header files?
[08:24] <Dr_Willis> sudo apt-get clean   - would clear out the apt cache - that can be several gb in size on some setups viaSanctus_
[08:25] <viaSanctus_> done that several times
[08:25] <viaSanctus_> have 2 hard drives
[08:25] <viaSanctus_> 1 with lots of space free
[08:25] <viaSanctus_> and 1 with none
[08:25] <FloodBot1> viaSanctus_: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:25] <Dr_Willis> if the space is filling up as fast as you free it - thats exactly what ive seen with  log files
[08:25] <viaSanctus_> Dr_Willis, it's annoying the hell out of me
[08:25] <k1l> viaSanctus_: so a "sudo apt-get autoremove &&sudo apt-get autoclean"
[08:25] <Dr_Willis> the ~/.xsession-errors   file wa he issue for me
[08:26] <Dr_Willis> so look and see how big the file is
[08:26] <k1l> viaSanctus_: that should free some space on the / partition. but if you know that problem i wonder why you do the same mistake over and over again?
[08:26] <viaSanctus_> can't see hidden files
[08:26] <viaSanctus_> over and over again?
[08:27] <leo> has anyone here been to the heart attack girl?
[08:27] <Dr_Willis> ls -al  .thefilename
[08:27] <k1l> viaSanctus_: you just told its happening often to you
[08:27] <johest> moin guys,  /etc/ssl/certs/Firmaprofesional_Root_CA.pem expires in 20 days (12.04 LTS)
[08:27] <k1l> leo: keep it to ubuntu support in here, please
[08:27] <viaSanctus_> k1l, never said that
[08:27] <Dr_Willis> ls -al ~/.xsession-errors
[08:28] <ActionParsnip> johest: I suggest you report a bug
[08:29] <ActionParsnip> leo: do you mean 'grill'?
[08:29] <lagerpc> Does anyone here have a laptop with Iris Pro 5200? Wondering if it works as easy as the Intel Graphic HD range cards, where drivers are pretty much a non-issue.

=== Alagar2 is now known as Guest30523
[08:44] <viaSanctus_> this is turning into a disaster
[08:44] <viaSanctus_> i've deleted the whole log content
[08:45] <viaSanctus_> nothing changes
[08:45] <viaSanctus_> 0 B free
[08:45] <viaSanctus_> when I move back the log content from a backup location
[08:45] <viaSanctus_> I can't siply copy the whole content back into the log folder. How is that even possible if 0B is free?????
[08:45] <viaSanctus_> I can copy*
[08:45] <Strit> Do you have Remote desktop activated?
[08:46] <viaSanctus_> no
[08:47] <Strit> viaSanctus_, My xsessions log quickly filled up my harddrive because someone tried to connect to my remote desktop all the time. After I disabled it, I had no problems. What does the log say?
[08:47] <Dr_Willis> did you check the log file in the users home? for the xorg stuff
[08:47] <viaSanctus_> Strit, it's not that
[08:48] <Dr_Willis> ls -al ~/.xsession-errors              would show its size
[08:48] <viaSanctus_> I cut/pasted the whole log content to a backup locations
[08:48] <viaSanctus_> so if the storage was filling up, it would be full
[08:48] <viaSanctus_> but i could paste the log content back
[08:48] <viaSanctus_> even though it said 0B free
[08:48] <k1l> viaSanctus_: is this system still running?
[08:48] <viaSanctus_> ?
[08:48] <viaSanctus_> i'm in it
[08:48] <Strit> how big is the .xsession-errors file?
[08:49] <k1l> viaSanctus_: then please pastebin a "df -h"
[08:49] <Dr_Willis> mine go to 17gb the other day
[08:49] <viaSanctus_> Strit, do you understand what I'm trying to say?
[08:49] <k1l> viaSanctus_: show the df-h please
[08:49] <happyjoy> how do i run a filesystem check on sdc?
[08:49] <k1l> "df -h"
[08:50] <viaSanctus_> one sec, rebooting the system
[08:50] <Strit> viaSanctus_, I think so, is the baclup location on the same disc?
[08:50] <viaSanctus_> of course not
[08:50] <Dr_Willis> !fsck | happyjoy
[08:50] <ubottu> happyjoy: fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo touch /forcefsck && sudo shutdown -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot
[08:50] <viaSanctus_> oh wait, another partition
[08:50] <viaSanctus_> same disk
[08:50] <happyjoy> that doesnt answer my question
[08:50] <happyjoy> *how*
[08:51] <Dr_Willis> happyjoy:  do that sudo touch.... command and reboot.
[08:51] <happyjoy> man page does not show an example of how a command is supposed to look
[08:51] <Dr_Willis> happyjoy:  or unmount the filesystem and 'fsck /dev/sda1'  or whatever
[08:52] <Dr_Willis> fsck [-lsAVRTMNP] [-C [fd]] [-t fstype] [filesys...]
[08:52] <happyjoy> i did unmount and ran sudo fsck /dev/sdc and got something about a bad block and bad superblock then the check was aborted
[08:52] <Dr_Willis> fsck                      -f ext4   /dev/sda1        (for example)
[08:52] <happyjoy> so i guess i did it right
[08:52] <Dr_Willis> no.. its not sdc
[08:52] <Dr_Willis> it would be sdc1  most likiely
[08:52] <Dr_Willis> sdc is the disk.. sdc1 is partion 1 on the disk
[08:52] <Dr_Willis>
[08:53] <sf> hahahaha
[08:55] <viaSanctus_> Strit, 1129 large
[08:55] <viaSanctus_> it probably means bytes or kb
[08:55] <viaSanctus_> in any case it's not the problem
[08:56] <k1l> viaSanctus_: please show in a pastebin "df -h"
[08:56] <k1l> !paste | viaSanctus_
[08:56] <ddssc> what's the easiest way to grant user access over sftp and have that user locked to one specific dir?
[08:56] <ubottu> viaSanctus_: For posting multi-line texts into the channel, please use http://paste.ubuntu.com | To post !screenshots use http://imagebin.org/?page=add | !pastebinit to paste directly from command line | Make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic.
[08:57] <Dr_Willis>  ddssc  that seems to get asked in here every day.. theres not a quick answer. I imagine theres posts about it at askubuntu.com - ive not seen a 'simple' answer ever given in here
[08:58] <viaSanctus_> it says /dev/sda1 size 15G used 15G avail 0 use 100% mounted on /
[08:58] <viaSanctus_> the rest is all on other partitions
[08:58] <ddssc> Dr_Willis: the reason it's asked is because apparently there's not a clean solution for it in ubuntu. all I want to do is create a dir, and grant access over it to a certain user. I don't want this user to be able to write outside or even look outside this dir.
[08:58] <viaSanctus_> with free space
[08:58] <ActionParsnip> viaSanctus_: uninstall unused kernels is a good start
[08:58] <k1l> viaSanctus_: *sigh*
[08:58] <ddssc> fairly simple request really, dont know why it has to be so complicated in ubuntu...
[08:58] <k1l> viaSanctus_: then do the apt-get commands i told you before
[08:58] <ActionParsnip> ddssc: its very simple
[08:58] <Dr_Willis> ddssc:  they souldent be able to write out side the dir without the right permissions. as for looking.. i dnt see what the big deal is
[08:59] <viaSanctus_> k1l, please paste it again
[08:59] <k1l> viaSanctus_: and remove old kernel-packages and older header packages
[08:59] <ddssc> Dr_Willis: looking at this atm. http://askubuntu.com/questions/134425/how-can-i-chroot-sftp-only-ssh-users-into-their-homes
[08:59] <viaSanctus_> there are only 2 header folders
[08:59] <viaSanctus_> guess they are not "old" ones
[08:59] <ddssc> ActionParsnip: then please do share.
[08:59] <k1l> <k1l> viaSanctus_: so a "sudo apt-get autoremove &&sudo apt-get autoclean"
[08:59] <ActionParsnip> ddssc: in what way?
[09:00] <ddssc> ActionParsnip: in way of words. written on my screen.
[09:00] <ActionParsnip> ddssc: I have OAPs and so forth using Ubuntu to browse the web, zero issues
[09:00] <ddssc> ActionParsnip: that doesn't tell me anything.
[09:00] <ActionParsnip> ddssc: what are you finding not simple, exactly?
[09:00] <k1l> viaSanctus_: please show a "dpkg -l | grep linux-header" in a _pastebin_
[09:02] <ActionParsnip> k1l: dpkg -l | grep linux-header | pastebinit     ;) assuming it's installed
[09:03] <viaSanctus_> http://pastebin.com/BMx76Gdi
[09:03] <ddssc> ActionParsnip: locking user to sftp access only , on his home dir only.
[09:03] <viaSanctus_> man I hate linux
[09:04] <ddssc> viaSanctus_: welcome to the club :)
[09:04] <k1l> viaSanctus_: is this a lucid?

[09:04] <ddssc> ActionParsnip: reading this as we speak
[09:04] <k1l> viaSanctus_: what does "lsb_release -a" give you? (please put into a pastebin)
[09:04] <ActionParsnip> ddssc: funny how I found that in about....what....5 seconds?
[09:05] <ddssc> ActionParsnip: i found that before I even came to this channel

[09:07] <viaSanctus_> Dr_Willis, yes
[09:07] <viaSanctus_> 1180 large (guessing it's kb)
[09:07] <Dr_Willis> delete that file. and clean out all the logs. is about all i can suggest.
[09:07] <Dr_Willis> it could be GB
[09:07] <jack_mathew> yeah

I burnt a video file for a friend for his xbox 360 on windows 7 yesterday. today I burnt another video but on brasero burner on my ubuntu laptop and now the other video won't show on here. yet when I switch back to 7 it reads the OTHER video I burnt. is there a way for both of them to be read on a single system?
[09:08] <Dr_Willis> sharpy35:  or use gparted
[09:08] <viaSanctus_> i've never called ms in my life
[09:09] <viaSanctus_> i just need a meg free space

[09:09] <sharpy35> okay thanks . i will try it with gparted
[09:09] <Dr_Willis> viaSanctus_:  if somthing is growing as fast as you free space.. then you may want to use a live cd and exp,ore the fs and free up space
[09:09] <michael87> burnt both on a single dvd btw
[09:09] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  you mean a multi-session dvd?
[09:10] <ActionParsnip> viaSanctus_: you'll probably find a new install cures your issue
[09:10] <Dr_Willis> Im not sure if ubuntu can access files on a 2nd session.
[09:10] <Dr_Willis> not even sure how windows accesses them
[09:10] <michael87> Dr_Willis, yeah I guess I did that.
[09:10] <Dr_Willis> im not even sure how to Make a multi-session dvd. :)
[09:10] <viaSanctus_> ActionParsnip, I'm in a production env with a whole team waiting for this to work
[09:11] <sharpy35> if i format it to ntfs with gparted, then all files and so on will be deleted right_

I burnt a video file for a friend for his xbox 360 on windows 7 yesterday. today I burnt another video but on brasero burner on my ubuntu laptop and now the other video won't show on here. yet when I switch back to 7 it reads the OTHER video I burnt. is there a way for both of them to be read on a single system?
[09:15] <Guest21795> thx
[09:15] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  i doubt if its going to be possible on the 360
[09:15] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  it
[09:16] <Dr_Willis> its easier to just set up a dlna/upnp server ;)

[09:35] <lolcat> Hello
[09:35] <lolcat> My X-server stopped working
[09:35] <lolcat> How can I reconfigure it?
[09:35] <lolcat> It goes into low-graphics, but no input works
[09:35] <lolcat> has to be commandline
[09:36] <lolcat> !xorg
[09:36] <ubottu> The X Window system is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart X, type 'sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm' on an ubuntu system. replace with kdm on Kubuntu. To fix screen resolution or other X problems: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution . Also see !xorgconf
[09:37] <lolcat> !xorgconfg
[09:37] <lolcat> !xorgconf
[09:37] <ubottu> The /etc/X11/xorg.conf file is deprecated, but sometimes may still be needed to pass values to specific drivers. Generic xorg.conf generation: http://ubottu.com/y/xorgconf - ATI/AMD ( fglrx driver ) specific: http://ubottu.com/y/atiamd - NVidia ( nvidia driver )specific: http://ubottu.com/y/nvidia man xorg.conf for file structure and syntax.
[09:38] <lolcat> Anyone?
[09:38] <linuxuz3r> try dpkg-reconfigure xorg
[09:38] <Dr_Willis> common issue.. cant say ive4 seen a common/simple fix.
[09:40] <k1l> lolcat: what did you do before that happend? which driver is installed? where is the driver from?
[09:41] <lolcat> I think I may have upgraded
[09:41] <lolcat> I think I am using the AMD one
[09:42] <lolcat> I probably need it to make me an inframs thingy?
[09:42] <k1l> if its not the ubuntu driver but driver from some homepage you might need to reinstall it after a kernel upgrade
[09:42] <lolcat> I can't enter homepages without X
[09:42] <lolcat> How do I make it just use whatever is default?
[09:43] <lolcat> Or would rebooint into .23 work?
[09:43] <lucido> startup applications, the commands set there are executed as what user?
[09:43] <Dr_Willis> depenmds on which ones you mean
[09:43] <Heebie> Does anyone know of a xen-kernel package for Ubuntu that adds paravirtualisation under Xen?
[09:43] <k1l> lolcat: yes, you could try the odler kernel entry in grub for testing
[09:43] <Dr_Willis> ~/.config/autostart/ - ran as the user.
[09:43] <lolcat> I just need ANY graphical interface
[09:44] <Dr_Willis> lolcat:  sudo apt-get install jwm      then select jwm at the login screen perhaps?
[09:44] <lolcat> I don't need 3d or 2d acceleration
[09:44] <Dr_Willis> thats the most minimal window manager in the repos
[09:44] <lolcat> Dr_Willis: I cant get to the login screen
[09:44] <lolcat> It pops up: GRAPHICS PROBLEM DETECTED
[09:44] <lolcat> And then it won't let me click or press anything
[09:44] <k1l> lolcat: you could show the dmesg and syslog in a pastebin
[09:44] <Dr_Willis> and the xorg log
[09:44] <lolcat> k1l: I just want to revert to the standard driver
[09:45] <k1l> lolcat: so you did something with drivers?
[09:45] <lolcat> No
[09:45] <lolcat> I upgraded my kernel
[09:45] <k1l> upgraded manually?
[09:46] <k1l> lolcat: do "pastebinit /var/log/dmesg" and pastebinit /var/log/syslog" and show them both urls in here
[09:48] <lolcat> k1l: It is a PITA to pastebin without X
[09:48] <lucido> Dr_Willis, startup application preferences  the command is: /bin/sh sudo /usr/bin/nvclock -n 630 -m 610 -f, I need to know because I have to set up a nopassword option in the sudoers file
[09:48] <lolcat> Is there any display enviroment I can start without lightdm ruinging everything?
[09:48] <k1l> lolcat: use a tty then and just type the shortened url into here
[09:49] <lolcat> http://paste.ubuntu.com/6191565
[09:49] <lolcat> But all I need to do is to revert to the NORMAL STANDARD OPEN driver
[09:49] <lolcat> Or even switch to the intel thing
[09:51] <malinus> am I supposed to enable firewall on ubuntu with ufw or leav it off, like it is by default? It kinda worries me that the firewall is off by default?
[09:52] <cfhowlett> malinus, turn it on if you want.
[09:53] <lolcat> k1l: I just need the name of the packages I need to remove
[09:53] <lolcat> fglrx
[09:53] <lolcat> remove it
[09:53] <lolcat> reinstall
[09:54] <lolcat> aticonfig
[09:54] <lolcat> done?
[09:54] <FloodBot1> lolcat: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[09:54] <k1l> lolcat: you got a amd video card? then its fglrx, yes
[09:54] <k1l> make sure kernel-headers are installed for the kernel to led the module be build for you
[09:59] <lolcat> k1l: I removed fglrx with apt and is now reinstalling, will that work?

[10:25] <Reacto> another question though, what's the su equivalent in ubuntu?
[10:25] <Reacto> in fedora su let me change to root

[10:26] <ubottu> Reacto,: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo

[10:40] <bulletxt|2> hi there, I'de like to use fusefat without being root or using sudo. Is this possible? Thanks
=== Alagar2 is now known as Guest78225
[10:40] <Dr_Willis> if the user is in the fuse group - i thought they could use the various fuse tools. thats sort of the point of the fuse stuff
[10:40] <Dr_Willis> !fuse
[10:40] <ubottu> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is a !kernel driver that allows non-root users to create their own filesystems. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace for more on FUSE.  Some examples of filesystems that use FUSE are !ntfs-3g, sshfs and isofs. A full list of Filesystems that use FUSE is here:  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems
[10:41] <Dr_Willis> but im not sure what fusefat does that the normal fat/vfat stuff dosent do
[10:41] <bulletxt|2> Dr_Willis:  thanks but the problem is that I did put fuse in my user groups but still fusefat says permission denied
[10:41] <Dr_Willis> you did log out of the user. and reloged in?
[10:41] <bulletxt|2> Dr_Willis: I need to find a way to mount fat partitions as normal user,. any ideas?
[10:41] <bulletxt|2> yea
[10:41] <bulletxt|2> I did
[10:42] <Dr_Willis> err.. with the ntfs-confg tool it can enable where users have full access to ntfs/vfat partions. or you can put a mount entry in fstab with the 'user' (or was it users) option
[10:42] <Dr_Willis> for the specific filesystem
[10:42] <Ceraphin> Hi all
[10:42] <Ceraphin> Is there anyone with a Macbook air 4.2 (2011) with ubuntu in dual boot?
[10:42] <Ceraphin> I can succeed to install it, i really could use some help
[10:42] <bulletxt|2> Dr_Willis: since I don't know the partition (i only know it at runtime), I cant add it to fstab
[10:43] <Ceraphin> and I don't even find any good help.
[10:43] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt|2:  is it an internal or excternal drive? is it the same disk/partion every time? is it usb removeable?
[10:43] <tbharath> My home directory is out of memory, I want to add memory of another drive, which has windows in it, how can we do that?
[10:44] <bulletxt|2> Dr_Willis: its removable (its an SD)
[10:44] <Dr_Willis> tbharath:  you mean 'disk space'
[10:44] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt|2:  a usb sd reader? or built in?>
[10:44] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, yes, with out lost of contents

[10:45] <asdfaaaa> I need help with AMD drivers 13.4 using Xubuntu 13.04, following this guide: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Raring_Installation_Guide
[10:45] <Dr_Willis> tbharath:  you mount the partionm to some directory and give the user permissions/chown/chmod the filesystem and the user can store stuff there. no need to  'merge' the 2 - it will appear to the user as a directory in theor home if thats how you want
[10:45] <cfhowlett> Ceraphin, so since something like 90% plus of the users in this channel are NOT Mac users ...
[10:45] <asdfaaaa> I have gotten 2 blackscreen after reboots...
[10:45] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt|2:  you are using the gui at all? or need this to be all console?
[10:46] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, it is my another drive , /media/bharath/E8DC1A1EDC19E818/
[10:46] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, how I  can do that?
[10:46] <Dr_Willis> tbharath:  and what filesystem is the drive using>
[10:46] <bulletxt|2> Dr_Willis: console
[10:46] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt|2:  i cant even find a fuse-fat package - but i am on my raspberry pi.
[10:46] <bulletxt|2> Dr_Willis:  its fusefat
[10:47] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt|2:  but im thiniking you got somntning setup wrong. because a user is supposed to be able to  use the fuse stuff
[10:47] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, NTFS
[10:47] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: its fusefat package
[10:47] <Dr_Willis> tbharath:  so you want to resize it?  or just want the user to have full access to it?
[10:48] <Dr_Willis> !info fusefat
[10:48] <ubottu> fusefat (source: fuse-umfuse-fat): File System in User Space - Module for FAT. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.1a-1 (raring), package size 32 kB, installed size 124 kB

[10:50] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, can we solve the solution with out resizing?
[10:50] <Dr_Willis> tbharath:  you DONT chown/chmod ntfs/vfat -  if you need them to be executable on a vfat/ntfs then youy MUST mount the ntfs/vfat with the right options. Normally via a fstab entry in /etc/fstab

[10:53] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  what command are you using exactly?
[10:53] <cfhowlett> asdfaaaa, now THAT makes me think you used corrupted ISO.  did you md5sum check?
[10:53] <asdfaaaa> cfhowlett: Don't except that, used wget from AMD site
[10:53] <asdfaaaa> here ->

[10:54] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis:  thats because im doing with label but of course /dev/sda1 is the same thing
[10:54] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, I am doing because I am out of memory
[10:54] <asdfaaaa> DR_Willis: I'm on Xubuntu now :D
[10:54] <ActionParsnip> asdfaaaa: why not use the additional drivers app in system settings?
[10:54] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, but will it work?
[10:55] <ActionParsnip> asdfaaaa: I believe spatry has a video how to guide for the drivers
[10:55] <Dr_Willis> tbharath:  once again.. you are out of DISK SPACE...  if you were out of MEMORY then you would want a bigger swap partition
[10:55] <k1l> asdfaaaa: dont use the amd site driver. use the repo driver. that is supported in here
[10:55] <asdfaaaa> ActionParsnip: true but I wanted to learn from installation packages...
[10:55] <asdfaaaa> kll: Do you have a link, thanks
[10:55] <ActionParsnip> asdfaaaa: check out spatry's channel on youtube
[10:55] <Sheldoraaaa> Dr_willis I tried xubuntu but my sound card stopped for some reason, n I tried a few ways to fix it but still no working

[10:57] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: fuseiso seems to work as normal user without issues
[10:57] <k1l> asdfaaaa: what?
[10:57] <cfhowlett> !home|lenz,
[10:57] <ubottu> lenz,: Your home directory is where all of your personal files are usually kept. For moving your home directory to a separate partition, please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving
[10:57] <ActionParsnip> k1l: lotta love in the channel
[10:58] <Sheldoraaaa> Dr_willis yes it worked for old version of Ubuntu like 10,11 and nop no even working for a second
[10:58] <lenz> Oh wow, thanks
[10:58] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  you could always alter the sudoers file to allow that user to run fusefat as root. but from all the fuse docs ive seen  in the last 10 min, all fuse enabled users should be able to use the fuse stuff
[10:58] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: yes in fact I cant understand why its not working ... :(
[10:58] <asdfaaaa> kll: I have formated (Xubuntu) two times because the AMD GPU drivers crashed after reboot, I hope that I do not need to format the third time..
[10:58] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  but ive not seen a single example of fusefat being used on a DEVICE. its always on a file..
[10:59] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  that may be the core issue here.
[10:59] <Dr_Willis> only root has full access to that device
[10:59] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: yea I understand what you mean... any ideas?
[10:59] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  do you have a gui at all?
[10:59] <k1l> asdfaaaa: you should look out what error happend and not just plain reformat.
[10:59] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: everythijng must be done from CLI
[11:00] <k1l> asdfaaaa: make sure the kernel headers are installed to let the video driver build properly
[11:00] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: I'm writing bash scripts so everything must be done from consol
[11:00] <BluesKaj> howdy all
[11:00] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, I did sudo mount -o remount,fmask=027 /media/bharath/E8DC1A1EDC19E818/, but doen't work
[11:00] <cfhowlett> BluesKaj, hey hey hey!   Blue is here!  NOW it's a party!
[11:00] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  so you cant even run ntfs-config to enbable the  system to let users have full access to ntfs/vfat? that would be an eaier way
[11:01] <asdfaaaa> kll: Will try, will atleast follow the YT guide ActionParsnip sent
[11:01] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  a gui right NOW to just run that tool is what im asking about
[11:01] <Dr_Willis> not a gui later
[11:01] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: partitions will always be Fat16/32..  is this a problem for ntfs-3g ?
[11:01] <Dr_Willis> ntfs-config handles them both
[11:01] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: ok
[11:01] <Dr_Willis> it has check box's to allow users full access. and it tweaqks the udisks, or udev. or whatever it is now a days..
[11:02] <BluesKaj> cfhowlett, think I'll retreat to a corner with my morning coffee :)
[11:02] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: ok Ill see if ntfs-config helps me
[11:02] <Dr_Willis> then i recall theres some tool other then mount  that will use that method to mount things
[11:02] <Dr_Willis> pdisk? i rarely need the tool
[11:02] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  you did check askubuntu.com about this? theres most likely several ways it could be done
=== Trevor_ is now known as TrevorX5J9
[11:03] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: I prefered your consulting :p anyways im going to try ntfs-config now and see how it can help me
[11:03] <Dr_Willis> my sdcard is always /dev/mmcblk* ;)   so that would make it eaasier to do here.
[11:03] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, pdsk?
[11:03] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: in my case it always changes and I only know the label at runtime
[11:03] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  so that label is always the same?
[11:04] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: no , it changes
[11:05] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: I don't see how to tell ntfs-config to allow non root users to mount  fat partition though
=== Alagar2 is now known as Guest40830
[11:05] <Dr_Willis> theres a check box.
[11:05] <Dr_Willis> it applies to both
[11:06] <bulletxt> it says "allow to read/write to external devices"
[11:06] <bulletxt> it does not say anything else though
[11:06] <Dr_Willis> then you use the nautilus/cli/whatever tool that i cant rember to mount them
[11:06] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: from cli whats the command then?  mount -L $label /$folder ?
[11:06] <Dr_Willis> its not mount.. its some OTHER command
[11:07] <Dr_Willis> might be at one of the following.
[11:07] <Dr_Willis> !ntfs
[11:07] <ubottu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions - For write access, see !NTFS-3g or !FUSE
[11:08] <Dr_Willis> !ntfs-3g
[11:08] <ubottu> ntfs-3g is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. Installation instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions
[11:08] <bulletxt> ntfs-3g supports fat?
[11:08] <Dr_Willis> they use the same tools
=== Trevor_ is now known as TrevorX5J9
[11:08] <Dr_Willis> ]sand options
[11:08] <CatKiller> bulletxt: ntfs-3g supports ntfs
[11:09] <bulletxt> my partitions will always be fat16/32 so I dont' see how ntfs-3g can help me
[11:09] <Dr_Willis> because the tools are all using the same subsystem.
[11:09] <Dr_Willis> ntfs/vfat are closely releated
[11:10] <CatKiller> Dr_Willis: Are you sure about that? how are they closely related?
[11:10] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, can you please help me , how can I make use of hard drive to run executables
[11:10] <tbharath> ?
[11:10] <CatKiller> Dr_Willis: ext2/3/4 are closely related, in fact ext2 can even mount ext3 and 4 partitions
[11:10] <Dr_Willis> tbharath:  askubuntu.com has sevarl questions/answers on mounting ntfs/vfat with executable bit set on EVERY file.

[11:11] <Nosophorus> how do i install totem.thumbnailer in Ubuntu 12.04?
[11:11] <CatKiller> bulletxt: So when you mount using ntfs-3g you use "FUSE", which is "File System in User Space". One advantage of mounting it in userspace is that you can mount it without being root
[11:11] <Nosophorus> i mistakenly deleted it
[11:11] <CatKiller> bulletxt: FAT32 uses a linux in kernel driver and a "mount" call
[11:11] <bulletxt> CatKiller: but I need to mount fat16/32
[11:12] <bulletxt> yea
[11:12] <Sheldoraaaa> !
[11:12] <bulletxt> CatKiller:  thats why I was looking at fusefat
[11:12] <CatKiller> So you want to mount something not as root right?
[11:12] <bulletxt> CatKiller: yes mount fat as non root
[11:12] <bulletxt> CatKiller:  I cant force anything in fstab as device will always be different (and even label)
[11:12] <Dr_Willis> !info pmount

[11:13] <Nosophorus> how do i install totem.thumbnailer in Ubuntu 12.04?

[11:16] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  ive never used the commands...
[11:16] <buleeen> i installed lubuntu for someone (an ex-windows user) who is unhappy with the fact i left him without a guide on how to use it. i need to email him something of the kind in pdf form. anything that already exists?
[11:16] <bulletxt> pumount
[11:17] <bulletxt> lol
[11:17] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  check the man pages perhaps? :) that url i posted mentioned sevarl tools.. some of those may be obsolete

[11:20] <bulletxt> Dr_Willis: ok I confirm pmount/ pumount are the solutions to my problem... thanks!
[11:20] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  that command mey be becoming obsolete. id check that guide i posted just in case
[11:21] <bulletxt> ok
[11:21] <Dr_Willis> bulletxt:  and if you had NOT used that ntfs-config tool to allow users full access. then pmount may or may not have worked..

[11:31] <Dr_Willis> xubuntu works very well on my eee netbook.
[11:31] <ezra-s> ActionParsnip, I know, but it is the same as "which distro is best for..." question, so best reply is to look at the #channel you are in and reply

[11:41] <Nosophorus> kostkon: i'll try that
[11:41] <kostkon> Nosophorus, create the file /usr/share/thumbnailers/totem.thumbnailer and put the three lines mentioned below
[11:41] <kenn_> it sleeps in 5 minutes whatever i set
[11:41] <kostkon> Nosophorus, e.g. sudo nano /usr/share/thumbnailers/totem.thumbnailer
[11:42] <Nosophorus> kostkon: yep, i'm doing that right now
[11:43] <kostkon> Nosophorus, also clear the cache if you haven't done it already and maybe logout and log back in
[11:44] <Nosophorus> kostkon: i'm affraid of doing that because i could lose some thumbnails i like and that were generated by totem.thumbnailer
