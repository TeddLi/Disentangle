[06:18] <patifa> yeah, z0rs, I'm not sure what breaks it there.
[06:18] <legend2440> timandtom: http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page
[06:18] <Fezzler> Deepthought: ok
[06:18] <cesar_bo> Mathman: ... could be the pulseaudio ?
[06:18] <paijo13> hi all. is there any hardy iso that contain only the base system?
[06:18] <AngieBTSea> Okay Mathman, I will keep fishing :) sound is being disagreeable
[06:18] <Fezzler> Deepthought: Learn something new!
[06:19] <nomasteryoda> cesar_bo, i've seen before with flash and firefox... there is a fix
[06:19] <timandtom> legend2440: Thanks!
[06:19] <Mathman> cesar_bo: I dunno.  seems like f8 had pulse audio.  flash worked on there for me.
[06:19] <Judeglass> is there a common reason why when editing in vi my arrow keys insert characters instead of moving the cursor?
[06:19] <Deepthought> Fezzler: to get desktop things again install 'advanced desktop settings' (synaptic), and switch' mo on in there
[06:19] <Fezzler> Deepthought: I did.
[06:19] <timandtom> Fezzler: :D Ubuntu has cube desktop stuffs? Whats it called? My brother saw a screenshot of vista doing it the other day, wants to try it.
[06:19] <anachronoks> the problem that i have is totem and firefox don't seem to want to share audio. it works in both separately, but not at the same time
[06:20] <Mathman> AngieBTSea: while I'm not expert, you'd at least stand a better chance if you explained a bit further than just "sound is being disagreeable"
[06:20] <yuiyui> how can i set different resolution for my dual monitors? im using ATI card and installed the ATI Catalyst  Control center
[06:20] <anachronoks> i wonder if it's because of pulseaudio
[06:20] <AngieBTSea> Mathman, sound will come out USB for some applications
[06:20] <cappicard> hrmm... timidity's being a pain: "ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:874:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave"
[06:20] <AngieBTSea> USB headphones
[06:20] <Mathman> timandtom: and...no.  it's called compiz fusion these days.  and no, vista doesn't do it.
[06:20] <nomasteryoda> anachronoks, you should be able to make totem "use" oss or alsa
[06:20] <Deepthought> Fezzler: the display settings don' t work with restricted, that's normal, use nvidia-settings, must be in settings menu (or the other sys menu, not sure) or in the terminal 'sudo nvidia-settings
[06:20] <AngieBTSea> but for other applications, it comes out the computer's built in speakers
[06:20] <Fezzler> Deepthought: Seem like after I turn on Visual Effects "Extras" and then set Desktop Cube and Rotate and close, it knocks Visual Effects to off
[06:20] <nomasteryoda> which share sound well enough for me
[06:20] <Deepthought> Fezzler: if it' s not there, install it too
[06:20] <yuiyui> but i can't set different resolution.
[06:21] <Mathman> AngieBTSea: ha, yeah, but hey, I gave it a shot.
[06:21] <AngieBTSea> and on 7.10 it was more agreeable
[06:21] <sessh1234> k, one more quick question
[06:21] <anachronoks> nomasteryoda: okay, i'll try it, thanks x 2 :)
[06:21] <sitanxin> hi,it`s my first to be here
[06:21] <timandtom> Mathman: Well maybe not by default... But I've seen plenty of screenshots of Vista with a cube of desktops(Thats what we're talking about, right? Or did I get it confused with something else?)
[06:21] <NemesisD> my panel has disappeared, how do i create a new one?
[06:21] <GhotiPhud> <unconvertable> sitanxin: welcome
[06:21] <Shadow_X> how do I change the resolution used when Ubuntu shows its splash screen during bootup?
[06:21] <fde> Fezzler: By "Advanced Desktop Settings" I think he means either gnome-compiz-manager or gconf-editor  :)
[06:21] <sessh1234> if i install a package and it installs dependancies, then i uninstall the package, how can i remove the dependancies that were installed?
[06:21] <corinth> Welcome, sistanxin. :)
[06:21] <Fezzler> Deepthought: But some of the Advanced Desktop features work.  Just not Cube stuff
[06:21] <timandtom> Mathman: Or maybe someone made they're XP look like Vista, i dunno :(
[06:21] <Mathman> timandtom: I'd guess the latter.  but who knows.  I used to run kde on windows at one poit
[06:21] <mike> Hello, I had a question
[06:22] <Mathman> point rather
[06:22] <fde> Fezzler: Or ccsm - it has a less neat GUI though...
[06:22] <sessh1234> kinda like gentoo's emerge --depclean
[06:22] <corinth> * sitanxin
[06:22] <NemesisD> nm found it
[06:22] <wolferine> have a question or two, about setting up an ftpd, when setting up, do you 'have' to create a new user, and you limit that user, or can you do it, without making the user.. ?
[06:22] <CloudFX> NemesisD: if only one of the 2 default ones were closed you should be able to right click the remaining one and choose "new panel"
[06:22] <sitanxin> why not talk?
[06:22] <timandtom> Mathman: Ah, cool, well, thanks :D I'll be sure to tell my bro.
[06:22] <Mathman> timandtom: well, that and I can only guess here what you mean by "cube of desktops".  but that certainly sounds like compiz fusion.
[06:22] <rgravener> no one wants to watch me live and chat?
[06:22] <Fezzler> Deepthought: So do what?
[06:22] <timandtom> Mathman: Like, a cube, with a desktop on each face
[06:22] <milly1234> why two panels? it takes up more room, never understood that
[06:23] <cesar_bo> this is a pain !!! why I can get the sound on youtube ... :(
[06:23] <jm1> a
[06:23] <o0Chris0o> rgravener: only if your female
[06:23] <fde> Off topic things of a social nature go to #ubuntu-offtopic
[06:23] <cesar_bo> sorry, "I can not get"
[06:23] <Deepthought> Fezzler: I wouldn't know then, but it doesn' t sound like stuff is wrong, just play around with settings and read the helps; not everything always works
[06:23] <Fezzler> Deepthought: Bouncy widows and other frivalities work
[06:23] <Mathman> timandtom: wikipedia my friend.  and youtube or some nonsense.  type in compiz fusion or something and you'll probably find what you're after.
[06:23] <mike> If anyone could help me out I appreciate it; I am trying to get my wireless card to detect networks.  It sais it is disabled when I find the hardware under lshd in terminal.
[06:23] <anachronoks> cesar_bo: try installing a different browser and see if it makes a difference
[06:23] <NemesisD> jesus, hardy really seems to do a number on my systems
[06:23] <Deepthought> Fezzler: then the driver etc is really ok
[06:23] <anachronoks> i just installed epiphany to try it
[06:23] <Deepthought> Fezzler: did you find the nvidia settings?
[06:23] <Fezzler> Deepthought: HMMM  But no Cube?
[06:23] <NemesisD> did hardy get rid of the restricted drvers manager or something? i can't find it
[06:24] <Mathman> ha.  this channel is madness.  kinda like gentoo back in the day
[06:24] <Fezzler> Deepthought: No.  WHere?
[06:24] <kindofabuzz> where can i talk to ubuntu developers?
[06:24] <AngieBTSea> My sound will not go where I want it to.  Right now it comes through the headphones for some applications but for others it will only come out the built in speakers
[06:24] <sessh1234> Mathman: do you know of an ubuntu equivalent for emerge --depclean?
[06:24] <fde> NemesisD: No, renamed it... it's now System > Administration > Hardware Drivers
[06:24] <AngieBTSea> And I was wondering if someone had any ideas why?
[06:24] <NemesisD> ah just found it
[06:24] <fde> NemesisD: It is always 'jockey-gtk' though  ;)
[06:24] <DATmafia> ubuntu is the perfect newbie distro
[06:25] <Fezzler> Deepthought: System>Admin>Hardware Settings says Nvida is in use
[06:25] <DATmafia> some learning curves but a gui install on 8.04 is nice and clean with a lot of management features enabled :-)
[06:25] <fde> DATmafia: Ubuntu is the perfect distro... its underpinnings are Debian... they just made the defaults more refined, and added tools to make it easier for new users.
[06:25] <Mathman> sessh1234: not off  the top of my head.  but if I recall there's certainly something like that.  apt-slog --euthanize--orphans or something.  ha, nah, but orphans sounds about right anyway
[06:25] <kindofabuzz> sudo deborphan | xargs sudo apt-get -y remove --purge && sudo apt-get autoclean  is a good cleaner, but you have to have deporphan installed
[06:25] <Deepthought> Fezzler: like I said, it's ok; settings in system or settings menu
[06:26] <kindofabuzz> deborphan#
[06:26] <fde> kindofabuzz: aptitude replaced deborphan in every way deborphan was useful  :)
[06:26] <Fezzler> Deepthought: You lost me
[06:26] <Deepthought> Fezzler: if it' s not there, install with synaptic
[06:26] <Mathman> AngieBTSea: I'd go with some forums and mailing lists at this point.  get some sleep and all...
[06:27] <kindofabuzz> fde oh ok
[06:27] <Fezzler> Deepthought: If what is not there?
[06:27] <Fezzler> Deep
[06:27] <kindofabuzz> http://strabes.wordpress.com/2006/10/16/clean-up-unnecessary-packages-on-ubuntu-dapper/
[06:27] <Deepthought> Fezzler: if nvidia-settings is not in menu
[06:27] <AngieBTSea> I might not be able to let it go Mathman
[06:27] <Mathman> DATmafia: seriously.  ubuntu has a gui install these days?
[06:27] <AngryElf> so there's no solution to this slowish command line?
[06:27] <fde> kindofabuzz: If fact, exactly what that long command accomplishes is handled by default in aptitude... just aptitude upgrade , if something isn't in use, it'll remove it for you  :)
[06:27] <Mathman> AngieBTSea: ha, fair enough
[06:27] <AngieBTSea> I will continue consulting google
[06:27] <AngieBTSea> :)
[06:27] <AngieBTSea> thanks for trying
[06:28] <Fezzler> Deepthought: I have Nvida, I have Visual Effects Extra, I have Advanced Desktop Settings.  Just that Desktop Cube and Rotate Cube don't work after upgrade
[06:28] <kindofabuzz> fde: so basically use aptitude instead of apt-get?
[06:28] <N1N31NCHN41L6> aptitude is easier
[06:28] <patifa> aptitude clean?
[06:28] <Mathman> kindofabuzz: use synaptic I say
[06:28] <z0rz> How can I list all disk from the live cd?
[06:28] <fde> kindofabuzz: yes, with one coveat... to search descriptions (default apt-cache search) you must use ~dfoo ~dbar ...
[06:28] <NemesisD> fde, do you know if hardy wold make abackup of xorg.conf before changing it? i used to have dual monitors set up to span and now theyre mirroring eachother
[06:28] <Mathman> isn't that the gui junk?
[06:29] <crdlb> Fezzler: what doesn't work about them?
[06:29] <z0rz> come on..
[06:29] <z0rz> lsdisk?
[06:29] <Deepthought> Fezzler: I meant nvidia-settings, to set resolution and stuff; cause you mentioned earlier that didn' t work with the display settings, wich is normal with restr. dr.
[06:29] <N1N31NCHN41L6> Fezzler:  - get the NEW Envy For Hardy or the leacy for Gutsy - should fix ur cube
[06:29] <kindofabuzz> so sudo deborphan | xargs sudo apt-get -y remove --purge && sudo apt-get autoclean is moot now?
[06:29] <fde> NemesisD: It should... hit /etc/X11/xorg.conf[tab key]
[06:29] <Mathman> z0rz: what?  like rescue mode?  dmesg would do the trick
[06:29] <Don_Miguel> wb Flannel
[06:29] <Don_Miguel> Flannel: took me a bit to double-check, and after doing "sudo fdisk -l", it looks like two[2] of my USB  sticks are listed as  sdd/sdd1 & sde/sde1 but there is NO listing as for SDB at 160 GB !!
[06:29] <patifa> NemesisD: there may be older versions of them there, check it out
[06:29] <crdlb> N1N31NCHN41L6: that makes no sense whatsoever
[06:29] <NemesisD> yeesh now its forcing me to start in low graphics mode
[06:30] <x1250> someone has managed to make sound work on a Packard Bell EasyNote (celeron with AC97 sound) ?
[06:30] <kindofabuzz> why do people use envy when all they have to do is check a box to enable there graphic drivers?
[06:30] <Mathman> NemesisD: back it up by hand, by all means.  go with nvidia-settings or whatever.  least that's the easy way to do it.  shame I didn't learn that command up until recently.  used to take me days to get my dual monitor junk set up
[06:30] <z0rz> Hmm I think my disk partition tables are corrupt... is there any way to recover them?
[06:30] <fde> kindofabuzz: actually, not really apt-get... but aptitude handles search/debfoster/deborphan/install/purge etc much easier.
[06:30] <Fezzler> crdlb: After I turn on Visual Effect Extra, theb go into Advanced Desktop and turn on Desktop cub and roate, close, it seems to knock Extra off
[06:30] <x1250> kindofabuzz: because sometimes it doesn't work that way
[06:30] <kindofabuzz> ahh
[06:30] <milly1234> I don't understand the use of envy, I heard it has something to do with nvidia or such, but I installed the nvidia drivers with synaptic, why would you need envy?
[06:31] <x1250> I dont use envy, but sometimes you have to go and edit xorg.conf manually
[06:31] <x1250> lots of people like that in #ubuntu-es
[06:31] <kindofabuzz> milly1234: linux = 100 ways to do the same thing
[06:31] <crdlb> Fezzler: does compiz work at all?
[06:31] <Deepthought> Fezzler: to get cube I don' t know, should work, but there are some settings in advanced desk. set. that conflict others; just try back to default no effects, the start with the cube, and other settings one by one; should go.   If you set a setting sometimes it sez it conflicts with others and asks if you want the other off; maybe you missed one of those and left something on that stops the cube
[06:31] <kindofabuzz> my compiz works
[06:31] <NemesisD> BOOYAH
[06:31] <NemesisD> ok i think ive found the magic bullet for hardy borking a display
[06:31] <milly1234> my cube has a fishtank in it :P
[06:32] <Mathman> kindofabuzz: I certainly wouldn't put it that way.  but sure, for the most popular type of applications there's more than one out there.
[06:32] <NemesisD> its worked on 2 computers today for me, just had to apt-get --reinstall the video driver
[06:32] <kindofabuzz> hehe
[06:32] <fde> Mathman: 24,000 packages, there is 100 ways to do everything  ;)
[06:32] <kindofabuzz> what is the ubuntu developers room called?
[06:32] <Mathman> kindofabuzz: or if you're a masochist I suppose you could edit a file using just bash and cat or something
[06:32] <Fezzler> crdlb: Yes
[06:32] <NemesisD> *spoke too soon*, my left display is now tweaking out with psychadelic colors
[06:32] <cesar_bo> hey, about the no sound on youtube, using epiphany I am gettings this warnings, on playing a clip: "ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:874:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave"
[06:32] <fde> kindofabuzz: What do you need devels for? They are busy people don't ya know  ;)
[06:32] <blackpearl> !swapon
[06:32] <ubottu> Factoid swapon not found
[06:33] <blackpearl> !swap
[06:33] <ubottu> swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[06:33] <milly1234> yea, but if you can install nvidia drivers with synaptic or apt-get, why use apt-get or synaptic to install envy then use envy to install nvidia drivers?
[06:33] <fde> blackpearl: /msg the bot please
[06:33] <kindofabuzz> fde: wanna ask if something is a bug or intended
[06:33] <crdlb> Fezzler: uh so if you enable rotate cube, what happens if you press ctrl+alt+right?
[06:33] <fde> kindofabuzz: File it as a bug, and if it's not, they'll mark it NOTABUG
[06:33] <kindofabuzz> fde: and want instant notification lol
[06:33] <Mathman> eh.  the unix philosophy is one good tool for one very specific job.  something like that, I mean, I know I didn't do that justice..  but anyway, I think linux, and unix in general, has that down pretty well.
[06:33] <musikgoat> crdlb: should go to the right desktop
[06:33] <pen> anyone here using tilda?
[06:33] <kindofabuzz> fde: on launchpad?
[06:34] <pen> why is it slow again? after all the updates?
[06:34] <musikgoat> pen yes
[06:34] <karllen2> hey i have a linux box setup to share my movies folder to the rest of the house....everything does work..the problem is its all wifi and it seems really choppy when i watch the movies over the network is there a better way to share these folders other than using smb or ethernet cables
[06:34] <crdlb> musikgoat: I know that :)
[06:34] <Fezzler> crdlb: My desktop slides to next one
[06:34] <punisher> sorry, go out
[06:34] <fde> kindofabuzz: Yes... or just Help > Report Problem... in the application if it's supported
[06:34] <blackpearl> fde, sorry
[06:34] <punisher> now I here
[06:34] <Mathman> sure some of those tools might be interchangable with multiple other tools.  but not for the most part.  you've got one X.  one ls.  one etc etc etc.
[06:34] <Fezzler> crdlb: I have four
[06:34] <pen> musikgoat: you have any solution
[06:34] <musikgoat> crdlb: why did you ask :-P
[06:34] <kindofabuzz> fde: oh ok
[06:34] <Daisuke_Ido> karllen2: yeah, don't use wifi
[06:34] <musikgoat> pen, solution for what, it works for me
[06:34] <crdlb> musikgoat: I wanted to know what happens on _his_ system :)
[06:34] <fde> blackpearl: It's fine, this is rather a high volume channel though is all  :)
[06:34] <albech> is acrobat reader available for download within the package manager?
[06:34] <karllen2> Diasuke: i was afraid of that
[06:34] <karllen2> lol
[06:34] <musikgoat> crdlb: lol sorry
[06:34] <Mathman> ha, actually there are two X servers out these days now that I think about it.  two free ones.  ha, ok, I give up
[06:35] <pen> musikgoat: it sometimes blank and I can't use transparency
[06:35] <Daisuke_Ido> karllen2: sorry, but that's about all you can do - wifi is barely enough to handle standard definition video in most cases
[06:35] <crdlb> Fezzler: make sure that both Desktop Plane and Desktop Wall are disabled
[06:35] <musikgoat> pen: I had that issue for a while as well, I fixed the way I started it... one sec
[06:35] <pen> musikgoat: j
[06:35] <pen> k
[06:35] <Daisuke_Ido> karllen2: this is why i ran 50ft of cable from my media box to the router...  i tried wifi and nada
[06:35] <Deepthought> fezzler, that's the settings conflicting I was typing about
[06:36] <karllen2> <unconvertable> Daisuke_Ido: can i run a cable to my mac
[06:36] <kindofabuzz> maybe use N? would that help with video?
[06:36] <RyanPrior> The latest update to GVFS is great! Thanks!
[06:36] <karllen2> <unconvertable> Daisuke_Ido: but still use wifi for internet
[06:36] <legend2440> cesar_bo: this might work it mentions installing libflashsupport. if you are using hardy it is already in synaptic so no need to download it. http://sendderek.wordpress.com/2007/10/20/how-to-fix-the-no-sound-issue-in-firefox-flash/
[06:36] <N> ??????????
[06:36] <patifa> albech: it's not open source.  You can get a PDF reader, though.
[06:36] <NemesisD> anyone know if the restricted nvidia driver is 'nvidia' or 'nv'?
[06:36] <Daisuke_Ido> karllen2: directly from one computer to another?  you can, but you'd need a crossover cable
[06:36] <RyanPrior> libflashsupport can (and probably will) cause Firefox to crash occasionally or frequently.
[06:36] <musikgoat> pen, do you know how to make a script?
[06:36] <cesar_bo> <unconvertable> legend2440: thanks, i wourl look at it
[06:36] <Booh-> How to launch mplayer from console but send display to my second display?
[06:37] <musikgoat> pen are you registered on freenode, so I can PM you?
[06:37] <pen> musikgoat: is that the only solution?
[06:37] <astro76> NemesisD: nvidia
[06:37] <karllen2> <unconvertable> Daisuke_Ido: id also hafta activate to devices as well
[06:37] <pen> musikgoat: i think so
[06:37] <knoppix> I have a really basic question. gparted lists sda1 and sda2 with sda5 as swap. what happened to sda3 and sda4?
[06:37] <karllen2> <unconvertable> Daisuke_Ido my wifi and the ethernet card
[06:37] <albech> patifa: i tried downloading the reader from adobe, but i get an error message.. maybe i need extra software to support rpm?
[06:37] <Booh-> In fact I would like to launch mplayer in full screen mode on my other display... (display is working now in xorg)
[06:37] <RyanPrior> knoppix: An angry penguin ate them.
[06:37] <deno> dose kmplayer work on ubuntu 8.04 ?
[06:37] <N1N31NCHN41L6> my ubuntu WONT start in normal get like a inch of desktop and then all black - have to use gnome failsafe - any ideas
[06:37] <fde> deno: yes
[06:37] <karllen2> <unconvertable> Daisuke_Ido: how can u tell if its a crossover cable
[06:37] <knoppix> lol I hope not
[06:37] <Daisuke_Ido> karllen2: you're already using a wireless router right?
[06:37] <deno> thank you
[06:37] <fde> knoppix: /nick  ;)
[06:37] <patifa> oh
[06:38] <karllen2> <unconvertable> Daisuke_Ido: yes
[06:38] <milly1234> ibflashsupport causes massive instability in flash in firefox 3 for many causing it to crash alot for whoever that was who was told to install it
[06:38] <patifa> wait nm albech, start the package manager and find 'acroread'
[06:38] <astro76> knoppix: look up primary vs extended partition
[06:38] <Daisuke_Ido> karllen2: just run the linux box to the router with ethernet
[06:38] <albech> patifa: 2 sec trying
[06:38] <karllen2> <unconvertable> Daisuke_Ido: will that improve speeds?
[06:38] <Daisuke_Ido> wait...  nevermind, you're watching on the mac
[06:38] <Daisuke_Ido> it might
[06:38] <Daisuke_Ido> and it's certainly worth a shot
[06:39] <knoppix> ok, i'll do that astro
[06:39] <Daisuke_Ido> but just check pc stores and even big box stores - it'll say crossover patch cable (usually)
[06:39] <karllen2> <unconvertable> Daisuke_Ido: mmmm ill try that its so far away tho and i know nothing about cableing
[06:39] <andronicus> hello
[06:39] <legend2440> cesar_bo: did you see what milly1234 wrote about libflashsupport causing instability in firefox 3?
[06:39] <Daisuke_Ido> you can tell because looking at one of the ends, it looks like a couple of the wires are crossed
[06:39] <cesar_bo> <unconvertable> legend2440: thanks, I solve my problem:D
[06:39] <musikgoat> pen: are you getting my messages?
[06:39] <andronicus> is anyone here running dual monitors?

[06:40] <z0rz> hmm looks like I will be reinstalling linux.... my hard drives partition table is gone after a apt-get upgrade :(

[06:41] <legend2440> cesar_bo: did you install libflashsupport?
[06:41] <Don_Miguel> Hi again, it has been another 1/2 hour or so, and I am repeating, with an update:
[06:41] <Don_Miguel> Repeat #2: Problem: IDE (working) partitions not visible after Gutsy net-upgrade to Hardy on SATA  Note: those IDEs still show in BIOS, but NOT in partition manager ! see update after "sudo fdisk -l"  Paste: http://pastebin.com/m4175c259
[06:41] <Deepthought> andronicus: ya betya
[06:41] <cesar_bo> <unconvertable> legend2440: yes that solve my problem
[06:41] <damo22> z0rz: you can recover it with testdisk
[06:41] <RyanPrior> z0rz: That is really nasty.
[06:41] <astro76> knoppix: http://www.faqs.org/docs/linux_admin/x1139.html
[06:41] <cappicard> hrmm... every video I play on youtube, google, yahoo, others freezes after two seconds
[06:42] <z0rz> testdisk?
[06:42] <Deepthought> andronicus: I am
[06:42] <legend2440> cesar_bo: ok
[06:42] <RyanPrior> z0rz: man testdisk for more info
[06:42] <Mathman> Don_Miguel: first I heard of partitions showing up in the bios
[06:42] <Deepthought> andronicus: on nvidia; tried three, have not succeeded yet
[06:42] <Don_Miguel> Mathman: the IDE drives
[06:42] <andronicus> have you been able to get windows to open up on your second monitor by default?
[06:43] <Mathman> Don_Miguel: so not the partitions?  you said partitions...
[06:43] <wolferine> !samba
[06:43] <ubottu> Samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT.
[06:43] <Don_Miguel> Flannel suggested that they SHOULD be mapped as SATA
[06:43] <Daisuke_Ido> Don_Miguel: all drives are considered scsi now
[06:43] <damo22> z0rz: if you havent rebooted, the current partition table should be still valid
[06:43] <damo22> z0rz: sudo fdisk -l
[06:43] <Daisuke_Ido> and will all show up as sd*
[06:43] <z0rz> damo22: I figured out the tables were corrupted by rebooitng :(
[06:43] <DanaG> Argh, this page crashes Firefox repeatedly:  http://ubnt.com/products/
[06:43] <karllen2> what is the best chat client for linux (aim and irc)
[06:43] <DanaG> And if you use nspluginwrapper, it just gives a big grey box.
[06:44] <DanaG> Don't you love sites that do that?
[06:44] <N1N31NCHN41L6> ok i updated grub and when it loads it STILL doensnt see my puppy?????
[06:44] <fde> Daisuke_Ido: Not exactly, all hard drives use libata, which defines its devices as /dev/sd??
[06:44] <damo22> z0rz: boot off livecd and run testdisk on your hard drive
[06:44] <musikgoat> DanaG: doesn't seem to be for me
[06:44] <Don_Miguel> Only my USB pendrives are showing up, not the IDE
[06:44] <Mathman> Don_Miguel: guess I blew it on what you were saying actually.  apologies
[06:44] <velizarov|laptop> hello.
[06:44] <Daisuke_Ido> fde: which means that, to the system, they're seen as scsi
[06:44] <musikgoat> DanaG: but i don't use nspluginwrapper
[06:44] <Don_Miguel> Mathman: none of us are NEAR perfect !
[06:44] <Daisuke_Ido> emulated scsi*
[06:44] <z0rz> damo22: I'm trying that now
[06:44] <Deepthought> Don_Miguel: many stat drives get mapped as scsi; it' s some sort of hardware abstraction layer, they get accessed through a scsi protocol; like some cd' s
[06:45] <Daisuke_Ido> but yeah, i see your point
[06:45] <fde> Daisuke_Ido: No... serial device
[06:45] <Deepthought> I meant sata
[06:45] <Deepthought> Don_Miguel: lik daisuk said, emulated, better word
[06:45] <Mathman> Don_Miguel: nah man, fdisk without any arguments but switches is going to just list whatever the first drive is I spose.  if you're lucky it's even that nice.  try fdicsk -l /dev/foo to see your other junk
[06:45] <fde> (libata was orginally intended for SATA)
[06:45] <andronicus> Deepthought: have you been able to get gnome to be able to remember the window position so that say firefox opens on a monitor other than the primary monitor?
[06:45] <nuSharper> hi there! which font is really used when i pick "sans-serif" from a font drop-down list? what's the name of that font? i know it isnt DejaVu.
[06:46] <mojo> fde:: I *THINK* that I fixed it...  Notice that my /boot partition was not mounted, becuase disk-by-uuid was failing on it.  Fixed my fstab to use /dev/hda1 instead.  See my pastebin and tell me if you think I need to do anything more to be *sure*.  Thanks!
[06:46] <mojo> fde::  http://paste.ubuntu.com/8840/
[06:46] <damo22> foo bar bat
[06:46] <velizarov|laptop> why kernel-image in ubuntu with xen, make without acpi?
[06:46] <z0rz> damo22: Testdisk isn't showing my hard drive in the list
[06:46] <warriorforgod> clear
[06:46] <Don_Miguel> Mathman: see update after "sudo fdisk -l"  Paste: http://pastebin.com/m4175c259
[06:46] <fde> mojo: That would explain it... I was going to ask you to check that the file exists, but thought as it's a server, you'd know that already  :o
[06:46] <DanaG> Lovely.
[06:47] <fde> mojo: Apologies, could have had it fixed an hour or more ago...
[06:47] <DanaG> When I tried to open it in konqueror, it froze X completely -- except for the cursor.
[06:47] <grayKot> <unconvertable> How to run application from console in specific desktop, not current?
[06:47] <Deepthought> andronicus: that sort of stuff is still buggy; there is a lot of difference in behaviour though using xinerama or not using xiner.  ... Do you use nvidia ?   or what else if not ?   How' s yer double screen set up ?
[06:47] <Don_Miguel> Mathman: can you be a bit more specific  ?
[06:47] <Flannel> nuSharper: Bitstream Vera Sans, probably.
[06:47] <mojo> fde::  well it *did* put files in /boot (the mountpoint), but there was no /boot/grub hierarchy.
[06:47] <andronicus> Deepthought: I am using nvidia twinview, no xinerama
[06:48] <mojo> fde::  i'm not stressing it.  Better than reinstall and having the derned internet out all night (we are night owls)
[06:48] <AngryElf> when I try to activate my LVM with vgchange it tells me that ther'es no entry for device-mapper in /proc/misc -- that the device-mapper driver is missing, how do I install that?
[06:48] <kindofabuzz> derned?
[06:48] <mojo> fde::  this is my home server machine and router/gateway.
=== sky_ is now known as white_skY
[06:48] <Mathman> Don_Miguel: guess I'm completely wrong here.  fdisk -l, just plain, seems to list all the drives.  what's the problem?  sda seems to have a bunch of junk.  what are you expecting to see
[06:48] <nuSharper> Flannel: i guessed that initially, but then, looking carefully, it doesnt look like Bitstream... i am more inclined to believe it is Liberation
[06:48] <Jordan_U> mojo, I'm back, so how did you get in the situation you are in?
[06:48] <andronicus> Deepthought: could this be a limitation of metacity and should i be looking to use another windows manager?
[06:48] <Matic`Makovec> Hello there. I remember Gutsy Gibbon having an awesome application for handing .bin files (it practically mounted it, but it was great). Now after I upgraded to Hardy I don't have it anymore and so I'm woundering what would that kind of thing be called?
[06:48] <fde> mojo: Same here... heh... and at least it is fixed, and you learned something yourself: apt it really good about telliing you exactly where to look, if you know what it's telling you  :)
[06:49] <Deepthought> andronicus: Ok, try nvidia-settings, change to separate x-screens, xinerama on; the see how it goes, if not satisf. switch back to twinview, that leave xinerama on in twinview (wich is weird, but hey, it works), and see then
[06:49] <Deepthought> andronicus: using compiz might help
[06:49] <N1N31NCHN41L6> ok i updated grub and when it loads it STILL doensnt see my puppy????? it JUST sees ubuntu - how do i get ubuntu to share grub
[06:49] <Jordan_U> mojo, And, it seems, how did you get out of it :)
[06:49] <arooni__> how can i get the mac address for my wireless card?  ubuntu gutsy..
[06:49] <fde> mojo: Either the file didn't exist, or the post-inst was defining it incorrectly... I overlooked the first, and didn't want to help with the second, cuz it can do damage  :o
[06:49] <mojo> Jordan_U::  methinks i fixed it... look at http://paste.ubuntu.com/8840/ and notice that /boot is a separate partition, and it failed to mount by uuid.  Mod fstab to use /dev/hda1 and it *seems* to have fixed it.  How can I be certain?
[06:50] <Don_Miguel> Mathman: I am looking HARD for a disk(IDE) with 160GB on it, or at least the two partitions with like 33.7 GB
[06:50] <Deepthought> andronicus: I' ve also found that in some situations starting a prog from a starter on different screen makes a difference (ie put a firefox-icon on screen 2 and start it, might end up on screen 2 like you want it)
[06:50] <zcat[1]> N1N31NCHN41L6: check the /boot/grub/menu.lst in puppy and see how i was set up.. copy the entry over to ubuntu's grub
[06:50] <zcat[1]> assuming puppy uses grub
[06:50] <andronicus> Deepthought: thanks for advise, restart is req'd
[06:50] <Don_Miguel> Mathman: oneof those has over 20 GB of files I want very much to be able to access !
[06:50] <Mathman> Don_Miguel: so your'e saying you have more than 3 disks attached?
[06:50] <RyanPrior> We don't support Puppy here.
[06:51] <DanaG> Yay, when flash isn't crashing, it's instead giving no audio.
[06:51] <DanaG> Thanks a pantsload, Adobe.
[06:51] <mojo> fde::  Jordan_U::  thanks for all the help.   fde, you have a right to be lazy, it's not really your problem.  thanks for the input.
[06:51] <fde> mojo: take a look around in /var/lib/dpkg/ (especially parts) for where I would have taken you...
[06:51] <N1N31NCHN41L6> there is no menu.lst in puppy why i did a sudo grub-install /dev/sda5
[06:51] <DanaG> At least with nspluginwrapper, it no longer takes the whole browser with it.
[06:51] <zcat[1]> RyanPrior: I'll support dual-booting with Vista as long as Ubuntu is somehow involved..
[06:51] <Deepthought> andronicus: Still I find myself dragging progs from one screen to the other many a time; but well, it can't be more hassle than one screen, right ?   isn' t two screens tha dopey big thingy surplus !?)
[06:51] <Jordan_U> RyanPrior, But we'll help people dual boot :)
[06:51] <mojo> fde::  is that the .deb cache for apt?
[06:51] <RedScare> why in gods name does Hardy and did Gutsy run so hot and run my battery down so much
[06:51] <fde> mojo: uhh... info rather... but yes
[06:52] <Deepthought> andronicus: you don' t need reboot, just pressing ctrl-alt-backspace will do the job, will reset x-server
[06:52] <RyanPrior> zcat[1]: That's true. I'm having to get acquainted with Windows now, because I need to be able to help people with Wubi.
[06:52] <DGS> hello :)
[06:52] <Mathman> Don_Miguel: I dunno.  pull the usb junk.  reboot.  or heck, pull everything but the system disk and the disk you're after.  make sure the stuff is plugged in even.  boot the junk up.  run "dmesg".  see what it tells you about your disks.
[06:52] <Don_Miguel> Mathman: (1) IDE 160 GB and (1) SATA of 250 GB, two USBs are showing up at ~4GB and ~8GB
[06:52] <mojo> Jordan_U::  originally got in this mess by doing upgrade via ssh and having it waiting on me to answer about a config file version confilct.  i had fallen asleep and i guess ssh timed out.
[06:52] <warriorforgod> Don_Miguel: Is your nick a reference to Castaneda?
[06:52] <NeoGeo64> Ubuntu really likes my quad core intel 6600 and its 4 gigs of ram
[06:53] <NeoGeo64> its using every bit of it
[06:53] <fde> mojo: You can look at those files via cat safely, especially post and pre things, but don't change anything unless you're sure...
[06:53] <mojo> fde::  i am always glad for positive learning experiences
[06:53] <zcat[1]> I'm doing a vista/ubuntu dual boot on Friday.. my second time ever messing with vista.. I really HATE vista :(
[06:53] <RedScare> i bet it does, that amd64 bujild NEOGEO?
[06:53] <Don_Miguel> Mathman, thanks .. worth a shot .. did not have any clue this was gonna happen !!
[06:53] <mojo> fde::  okay, sounds interesting enough to peruse
[06:53] <NeoGeo64> flash really takes alot of cpu time for some reason (poorly written) but with all this speed it doesnt make a difference
[06:53] <RedScare> I really like vista
[06:53] <zcat[1]> hope I don't screw it up
[06:53] <zcat[1]> RedScare: well, it's not bad in one way.. a lot of ppl hate vista so much thel'y even consider Linux in preference to it :)
[06:54] <RedScare> thats funny
[06:54] <fde> mojo: Might give you a good idea of how much work devs put in also  :)
[06:54] <_kevin_> has anyone been having trouble burning cds in hardy?
[06:54] <Mathman> zcat[1]: all I know, don't install xp second.  ha, and don't take the thing home where you don't have a static ip if you're installing corporate edition
[06:54] <RedScare> and those people will find... exactly what they found with vista.... compatibility problems!
[06:54] <RyanPrior> RedScare: I find that people who didn't like Windows before Vista often do now, but people who liked Windows the way it was now don't like Vista.
[06:54] <mojo> Jordan_U::  seemed like a good idea to put a headless box in the closet, replace the crappy d-link router (this box has a 4-port GigE HP switch-on-a-card), and eventually use it as a home server and centralized torrent dl, etc.
[06:54] <Don_Miguel> Flannel & Mathman, Thanks for your help .. I'll try a re-boot w/o the USBs  and see what happens ...
[06:54] <_kevin_> i had trouble burning them in gutsy but I heard the newer kernel may fix the problem
[06:55] <RedScare> evolution is a beautiful thing
[06:55] <mojo> Jordan_U::  it sucks when boxen go astray and they have no video card or kbd attached.
[06:55] <x1250> I am the kind of people that didn't like windows before, and now doesn't like it either.
[06:55] <legend2440> !ati
[06:55] <Mathman> Don_Miguel: not trying to be a jerk here man, but it sounds like you really oughta double check that the thing is plugged in
[06:55] <ubottu> For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:55] <Booh-> When I start a graphical app from console, how to send display to another display?
[06:55] <fde> _kevin_: does 'wodim --data /path/to/file' work? (assuming it's an ISO... else --audio etc man wodim)
[06:55] <pen> is there a way to reset session options?
[06:55] <Deepthought> RyanPrior: so true...
[06:55] <AngryElf> does anyone know how to load up device mapper?
[06:55] <Don_Miguel> will need to wait a few minutes for bit-torrent to finish ...
[06:55] <mojo> fde::  actually i have a fair guess at the amt of work, but am sure i am waay off :P
[06:55] <RedScare> there's really nothing wrong with windows, or ubuntu, its just choice and preference
[06:56] <pen> now the sessions doesn't look for the checkbox in startup programs tab
[06:56] <DrifterSX> psp video support now worx with hardy yay!!!
[06:56] <Mathman> eh, me, I like windows just fine.  if that's all I had.  I'd live.  I just like linux better, despite the steep learning curve
[06:56] <RedScare> what I do prefer it software the works with a with virtually infinite hardware
[06:56] <zcat[1]> RedScare: yes and no.. Friday's client is already running OOo and Firefox and a few other OSS programs, there's very little she's using in Windows that isn't exactly the same in Linux. The biggest issue will be replacing Autocad with qcad.. which is why she wants dual-boot so she can still get to autocad if she needs it
[06:56] <pen> it starts programs saved in the "Remember Currently Running Applications"
[06:56] <RyanPrior> RedScare: you're implying that Windows and Vista are both perfect, it's just a matter of choice? Like who's better, Beethoven or Bach?
[06:56] <RedScare> and Microsoft did a great job there
[06:56] <kaf> <unconvertable>
[06:56] <pen> how to reset that so it will look for the startup programs?
[06:56] <RedScare> I'm implying none are perfect
[06:56] <RyanPrior> RedScare: I meant Vista and Ubuntu, not Windows and Vista. +D
[06:57] <RedScare> they all have pro's and con's
[06:57] <RyanPrior> RedScare: when you say "nothing wrong", that doesn't sound like imperfection to me.
[06:57] <_kevin_> i haven't tried in hardy yet. I was just wondering. I used to use k3b because of its varify option but will try brasero next time
=== DGS is now known as RelookNA
[06:57] <kaf> open suse is more beautiful.
[06:57] <RedScare> I was generalizing, just like there's nothing wrong with liking sushi
[06:57] <RyanPrior> RedScare: There is something very wrong with Windows - it's non-Free software through and through. It keeps users, as rms says, divided and helpless.
[06:57] <raybr> hi guys, I just updated to ubuntu 8.04 a few days ago, and and i was able to access my C:\(from windows) via ubuntu, but not sure why, since yesterday i'm unable to access it anymore
[06:57] <Mathman> Booh-: definitely possible.  google probably has an answer too.  apparently me and you are about the only people that care.  one of us is going to need to hit google.  you can either wait for me to maybe get curious enough, or you could try and hit google yourself.
[06:57] <Mathman> Booh-: or keep asking here I spose...
[06:58] <zcat[1]> open suse is a dog. Ubuntu has spoiled me, I find just about every other Linux distro hard now
[06:58] <mojo> Mathman::  thing is once you start to get a handle on it, you find that Linux makes much more sense to you than windows does.  Windows is all mysterious under the hood, and as you learn how things should/could be done you just hafta shake your head at some of the decisions MS has made with windows architecture
[06:58] <RedScare> And it powers corporate America as to provide the infrastructure to allow people like me to stay at home and program free to use ware
[06:58] <DrifterSX> sup zcat
[06:58] <fde> raybr: sudo mount -a bring it back by chance?
[06:58] <pen> anyone here familiar with session preference?
[06:58] <AgentHeX> is there a reason ubuntu-xen-desktop depends on xenman and xenman is not in synaptic?
[06:58] <Deepthought> RedScare: I agree, windoze was the first thing to make able to use a pc to it's full potential whan I was new to it (win 3 it was); coming from atari st pc seamed pretty meager; Billy made the thing WORK !; but now ubunt takes the tor ch and gets me where I always wanted to be with my super-duper ultra-rig
[06:58] <x1250> RyanPrior: thats right.
[06:58] <raybr> will try it fde
[06:58] <fde> pen: ask your actual question please.
[06:58] <Mathman> Booh-: or...heck, if you mean something along the lines of export DISPLAY=machine:1.0.  then yeah, that's how you do it.  I guess I'm not really sure what you're after at this point
[06:59] <pen> fde: I already asked it. The question is how to reset the session?
[06:59] <Mathman> Booh-: if it's what I'm beginning to suspect though, then the short answer is to use ssh's X11 forwarding.
[06:59] <raybr> am not on ubuntu right now because of the file system accesss issue
[06:59] <RedScare> yes, I am quite fond of Ubuntu, but it's not for everybody, just like Windows is not for everyone
[06:59] <pen> fde: for example, I have tilda opened and I clicked "Remember Currently Running Applications" button
[06:59] <N1N31NCHN41L6> mojo:  think ur idea would work for me ........(02:48:29 PM) mojo: Jordan_U::  methinks i fixed it... look at http://paste.ubuntu.com/8840/ and notice that /boot is a separate partition, and it failed to mount by uuid.  Mod fstab to use /dev/hda1 and it *seems* to have fixed it.  How can I be certain?
[06:59] <mojo> fde, Jordan_U - FOR THE RECORD:  Though I think disk-by-uuid *can* be handy for removeable media, i HATE reading it all over my /fstab/ by default.
[06:59] <Mathman> mojo: well yeah, windows is a black box.  as I said, I much prefer linux
[06:59] <pen> fde: now even after I unchcek tilda in startup programs it still start up tilda
[07:00] <Booh-> Mathman: no no.  I have 2 independant screens and I want to start mplayer from my main screen to display to the second one.
[07:00] <fde> pen: System > Preferences > Session is all you'll need for that.
[07:00] <mojo> Mathman::  agreed
[07:00] <Booh-> Mathman: both screens are working at this time.
[07:00] <Mathman> Booh-: so yeah, I guess I was right the first time.  refer to my googling it comment
[07:00] <Deepthought> mojo: exactly; My mother is very intelligent and technical; she doesn't understand the whole 'separate PC from user' aproach from win, gets confued all the time while it's all so easy; but a s you said under the hood and hidden
[07:00] <pen> fde: please, read my question
[07:00] <tonyr1988> I've got my computer as a web server (sort of) via DynDNS. It works perfectly for computers that I try it on - even from other networks, but not from my cell phone's browser. Any ideas?
[07:00] <RedScare> If i could debug why the ACPI support in ubuntu is horrible on my notebook it would be my primary OS actually
[07:00] <Booh-> Mathman: but... I am in google since one hour!
[07:00] <corinth> Anyone know of a KDE 4 unstable repo for Kubuntu?
[07:01] <RyanPrior> RedScare: yeah, ACPI tends to be a total mess.
[07:01] <mojo> Deepthought::  a hidden *mess*, im-not-so-ho
[07:01] <Kickboy> I keep getting a seg fault when I launch network-admin. This is a recent occurrence (on Hardy). I've tried reinstalling the packages with no success. Kinda stuck at this point. Anybody else experience this?
[07:01] <erik____> I have tried to install the latest version of Ubuntu 8.04 on my new computer, the motherboard is a Asus p5s mx se, which has the sis 191 network adapter. But i cant get the network to work. I dont have the ISA bridge problem reported by other people before
[07:01] <fde> pen: Scrolling up I don't see it... what I told you will allow you to remove tilde from the default session.
[07:01] <Mathman> Booh-: ha, now you got me in know it all mode.  spose I'll find it in a few seconds...
[07:01] <RedScare> I give it a year, maybe two and mass usage will really kick in
[07:01] <lnxnwbe> what is the comand i type into terminal to edit grub?
[07:01] <mojo> Verbosity rules.
[07:01] <AgentHeX> does Xen work for anyone in Hardy?
[07:01] <magnetron> 2008, the year of Desktop Linux
[07:01] <pen> fde: do you mean the startup program tab?
[07:01] <pen> fde: that doesn't work
[07:01] <tonyr1988> lnxnwbe: gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[07:01] <mojo> I would have never figured my problem out if linux were not verbose where it counted
[07:01] <RedScare> but the socialist undertones of this type of software makes me want to change my major out of programming
[07:02] <tonyr1988> lnxnwbe: Make sure you back up first.
[07:02] <RyanPrior> AgentHeX: Xen works well with Ubuntu.
[07:02] <pen> fde: because i have clicked the button in the session option tab
[07:02] <pen> fde: i want to reset that
[07:02] <lnxnwbe> tonyr1988: ty
[07:02] <tonyr1988> lnxnwbe: There's also a GUI, called QGRUBEditor, if you want a graphical way of doing it.
[07:02] <RyanPrior> AgentHeX: I don't personally use it, but it's definitely supported by Canonical on the commercial level.
[07:02] <AgentHeX> RyanPrior: have you any experience with it in Hardy?
[07:02] <RedScare> but I do love compiz
[07:02] <RedScare> and virtualbox
[07:02] <fde> pen: remove tilde from that list... and remove it from the Current Session list.
[07:02] <AgentHeX> RyanPrior: i'm trying to install ubuntu-xen-desktop, but it depends on xenman, and that doesn't appear in synaptic.
[07:02] <Booh-> Mathman, It's ok!  export display have done the job!
[07:02] <magnetron> RedScare: this is a support channel.
[07:02] <Booh-> good :)
[07:03] <pen> fde: I did, it stiill comes back
[07:03] <lnxnwbe> <tonyr1988>: no i just want to edit boot order
[07:03] <RyanPrior> AgentHeX: hmm, don't know about that. I'm a kvm user myself.
[07:03] <pen> fde: I have no idea why
[07:03] <Deepthought> mojo: yep, a grown convention stacked upon a grown conv ad infinitum making for a bunch of workarounds that need a sneak arounbd the corner aproach to make it work; instead of telling the rig what to do you have to think of what to say to make it belief the thing  you want it to do (are you still theree.. ?)
[07:03] <magnetron> !offtopic
[07:03] <ubottu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[07:03] <RedScare> well, no one knows anything about gnome-power manager so I often come visit and ask a couple of questions pertaining to why my vista battery life it 3x longer than my ubuntu's
[07:03] <mojo> Someone quoted earlier here that the Unix way is to have small programs do one thing, and one thing well, so they can be used together to do greater things.  I'll also mention that failing loudly and verbosely is another great trait
[07:03] <musikgoat> pen the issue is a bug with tilda that the developer wont fix
[07:03] <Mathman> Booh-: ok.  I was figuring you wanted something like window position options for when you start your app.  which is definitely doable.  but anyway, long as you're happy
[07:03] <fde> pen: ps -e | grep tilde <-- pkill -9 that, then save current session again
[07:03] <alienseer23> got me a stubborn directory that is owned by "root:plugdev" that I cannot change the permissions of ownership on, and I need to, it won
[07:03] <Deepthought> magnetron: you'r e right, we' re drifying here... sorry... !
[07:03] <pen> musikgoat: why not?
[07:03] <Deepthought> drifting
[07:04] <musikgoat> pen in the grey box, type exit
[07:04] <pen> fde: save? you mean in session option?
[07:04] <magnetron> Deepthought: feel free to drift in #ubuntu-offtopic , feel free to join
[07:04] <mojo> Deepthought::  one word would be enough:  registry
[07:04] <fde> pen: Wherever you saved it before... I'm looking at the interface, and it's changed... so I'm not exactly sure.
[07:04] <pen> musikgoat: I'm not using tilda now
[07:04] <pen> fde: oh
[07:04] <verges> mhh... i installed flashplayer 7 a few decades ago
[07:04] <pen> fde: I see
[07:04] <verges> and installed flash player 9 right now
[07:04] <alienseer23> what would make changing the permissions or ownership of a folder and its contents non-permitted even when using sudo?
[07:05] <fde> pen: It used to have a "Save" button right in there... but I guess they decided to take that option out...
[07:05] <verges> but when i start firefox it's still loading flash 7
[07:05] <verges> how can i change this?
[07:05] <Mathman> alienseer23: chattr I spose?
[07:05] <pen> fde: why? that makes this difficult to manage
[07:05] <crazyer> sudo chown -R yourdir
[07:05] <Ainu> hey guys im new here, i was just wondering what the #ubuntu-read-topic chan is about, does THIS chan auto-test everyone for the dcc vuln? thats what i really wanted to find out
[07:05] <inukshux> Arrgh, how can I put AWN on the top of my desktop?
[07:05] <pen> fde: I have no idea of what session is saved
[07:05] <chris_420> does anybody no the applet which is apparent on the menubar for networking? shows network interfaces and available wireless networks?
[07:05] <RedScare> does any know a workaround for the automounting of USB flash drive problems in hardy
[07:05] <alienseer23> mathman: dunno what that is, how would I fix that?
[07:05] <Ainu> does being in here mean im not affected buy it
[07:05] <mojo> Deepthought::  little things also bug me to no end, like desktop.ini and thumbs.db turds all in my directories.  Still dealing with those as two roomies have WinXP boxen accessing the r/w shares
[07:05] <Ainu> by*
[07:05] <Beavter> Im not exactly sure as to where to ask this question but I just wondered if anyone here has had the chance of toying with Ventrilo through Wine and actually got it to work
[07:05] <Booh-> Mathman, In fact, it's a test... I want to run 4 different mplayer on 4 differents screens... in full screen for a project of animation in a show room...
[07:05] <inukshux> I'd like to put my main panel on the bottom, while AWN on the top. How?
[07:05] <fde> pen: I have no idea... I'm sort of disappointed myself.... I usually just add and remove things from the session manually...
[07:06] <clarity> hey, this install doesn't have gmake and apt-cache search gmake doesn't come up with anything... what package do i need to install for devel?
[07:06] <Carbonflux> has anyone had any problems with window placement in 8.04 with compiz-fusion and Twinview ?
[07:06] <pen> fde: why did they changed that? is there a reason?
[07:06] <fde> pen: I never have clicked 'Save Current Session' but it at least used to be there
[07:06] <stdin> Ainu: you only get send there when you have been exploited when someone attacks this channel
[07:06] <zcat[1]> mojo: find . -name thumbs.db -exec rm {} \;
[07:06] <zedster_> I installed some software to use my wiimote on ubuntu 8.04 today, and my touchpad stopped working, I reset my xorg, no go, any ideas?
[07:06] <Booh-> Mathman, I was able to start 2... so I suppose now as long as I will be able to make 3 dual video card running in the computer... I will be able to do it :)
[07:06] <mojo> zcat[1]::  you rock
[07:06] <Ainu> oh ok
[07:06] <pen> alright
[07:06] <fde> pen: Not sure.
[07:06] <musikgoat> pen: did you still want help via PM? did you register?
[07:06] <NeoGeo64> wow
[07:06] <Ainu> i just wanted to find out for sure whether or not if im vulnerable to dcc
[07:06] <NeoGeo64> gnome is so cool
[07:06] <pen> musikgoat: I'm not sure, try
[07:06] <Beavter> I can log in hear others talk I am just having trouble sending a signal out
[07:06] <pen> musikgoat: I did the nickserv thing
[07:07] <NeoGeo64> I Just hit the Windows key + M and the entire screen goes inverted.
[07:07] <Mathman> alienseer23: well, you can do a "chattr +i" to a file or directory (I think on the directory part, never tried it to be honest), and then it's basically stuck like it is until you do a "chattr -i" on it.  but this is a wild guess mind you.  lsattr would tell you if the immutable bit is set at any rate
[07:07] <stdin> Ainu: as long as you connect on port 8001, then you're not
[07:07] <erik____> How do i get the SIS191 ethernet adapter to work in 8.04
[07:07] <mojo> NeoGeo64::  and getting cooler all the time
[07:07] <lnxnwbe> uh oh, I just upgraded to 8. ubuntu and its very slow
[07:07] <RedScare> while we are the subject of gnome
[07:07] <NeoGeo64> win + m = invert
[07:07] <NeoGeo64> cool
[07:07] <cappicard> hrmm.. swiftweasel is crashing way too often with anything with flash
[07:07]  * mojo hides pointy hat, looks around playing innocent
[07:07] <qasim> yesterday i upgraded from gutsy to hardy and now the "make" command is not executing, any idea why? it is giving me error that make[1]: dot: Command not found
[07:07] <clarity> ah, build-essential
[07:07] <clarity> thanks
[07:07] <Ainu> i need to do more reading, why are routers just affected by that one port
[07:07] <Deepthought> mojo: yep; let's take the conv to #ubuntu-offtopic, as in fact it really is... ; I' there now !
[07:08] <mojo> Deepthought::  sure if n' ya like
[07:08] <musikgoat> meh, pen i'm on aim under the same name if thats easier
[07:08] <chris_420> anybody know how to re add the task bar to a menu once removed?
[07:08] <Mathman> qasim: haha, sounds fun
[07:08] <pen> musikgoat: I don't have aim.
[07:08] <musikgoat> ok nvm
[07:08] <qasim> Mathman: yeah, I am really enjoying it :-p
[07:09] <zedster_> $ sudo rmmod psmouse, $ sudo modprobe psmouse, if I run these commands my touch pad works for a sec
[07:09] <sirmike1970md> hi i just installed kubuntu and i cant get it to go 1024x768
[07:09] <chris_420> < running gutsy.... no problems with make what so ever
[07:09] <AgentHeX> !xen
[07:09] <ubottu> XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen
[07:09] <pen> musikgoat: nevertheless, is chmod +x right?
[07:09] <musikgoat> pen yes
[07:09] <Mathman> qasim: and...this is why I always go with a fresh install.  no matter what the debian folks tell me
[07:09] <fde> chris_420: right click panel > Add to Panel > Menu Bar in that list
[07:09] <musikgoat> pen a+x
[07:09] <pen> musikgoat: I have been researching on the script thing, so I have basics idea for sh fiels
[07:09] <pen> musikgoat: a+x??
[07:09] <pen> musikgoat: what does that do?
[07:09] <musikgoat> pen +x should work
[07:09] <ushimitsudoki> (Hardy x86_64)FF 3 Beta 5 is bugged? The active tab randomly (?) loads the home page? Anyone seen this or perhaps it is something unique to my config?
[07:10] <pen> musikgoat: ok
[07:10] <musikgoat> pen a+x is all add execute
[07:10] <chris_420> fde the menus are there the taskbar how ever isn't... you know... where the "tray icons" go
[07:10] <stdin> Ainu: because they are trying to be helpful opening a port when they see a certain string in IRC, and since the default IRC port is 6667 they only do it when the connection is on that port
[07:10] <qasim> Mathman: i have never done fresh installation since my shift to ubuntu from edgy days. this is the first time that i encounter this sort of error
[07:10] <Mathman> qasim: nah, I mean, from what I understand that apt-get upgrade world or whatever the heck should work darn good.  not like a yum upgrade or whatever.  but yeah, old habits die hard and I don't trust upgrades
[07:10] <chris_420> not necesary just something that would be pretty nice to have haha
[07:10] <pen> musikgoat: ok
[07:10] <musikgoat> pen then for the Preferences -> Sessions  make a new start item pointing to that script
[07:10] <pen> musikgoat: k
[07:10] <RedScare> haven't seen it ushimit, but I have seen a plethora of other problems out of it
[07:11] <pen> musikgoat: going to test
[07:11] <musikgoat> pen, you can test that script by (making sure tilda is closed)
[07:11] <fde> chris_420: It should be there under "System Tray"
[07:11] <pen> musikgoat: ?
[07:11] <qasim> Mathman: good for you, i am badly stuck at this "make" utility :(
[07:11] <chris_420> aight will check again... thanks
[07:11] <musikgoat> pen and going to the dir and typing ./start_tilda.sh
[07:11] <pen> ok
[07:11] <ushimitsudoki> RedScare: this is making it darn near unusable! Didn't happen before I upgraded.
[07:12] <fde> chris_420: make that Notification Area ... sorry
[07:12] <chris_420> ahhh ok
[07:12] <RedScare> ushumit, did you clean install or upgrade
[07:12] <Mathman> qasim: dot.  almost sounds like it's not likeing something along the lines of ./command.  but that cant be it.  why would it say "dot"?  I dunno, try reinstalling make?  try with a real simple makefile?  perhaps it's your makefile
[07:12] <ushimitsudoki> RedScare: upgrade, not clean install
[07:13] <chris_420> would you by any chacne happen to know the applet for the networking that initially appears beside the "userr name?
[07:13] <pen> musikgoat: hm, tilda doesn't start
[07:13] <qasim> Mathman: i have reinstalled make again but to no avail. And the same makefile is executing perfectly fine on gutsy
[07:13] <RedScare> I did a clean install, since I haven't seen that particular issue it may have something to do with a leftover FF extension from FF2
[07:13] <_kevin_> a feature i'm missing in hardy is the ability to shift resolutions with ctrl+alt+-/+. I examined the xorg.conf file and found no "modes" line. If I create a modes line will the resolution keys work?
[07:13] <musikgoat> pen: ls -l  in that directory
[07:13] <RedScare> have you tried a complete removal, and reinstall of FF3?
[07:13] <Tazbobu> Ok, sometimes Ubuntu really sucks... I understand why people give up and go to windows.. I have upgraded to a new distro 4 times since I started with Ubuntu, and every time it hoses a bunch of stuff... it seems ridiculous that a simple NVIDIA graphics driver gets messed up every time
[07:13] <musikgoat> pen and make sure you have the x bit set
[07:13] <pen> musikgoat: -rwxr-xr-x
[07:14] <pen> musikgoat: is it good?
[07:14] <chris_420> oh snap got both back haha
[07:14] <fde> chris_420: that is nm-applet 'Network Monitor' I think is the same thing.
[07:14] <musikgoat> pen yes, if you are the owner
[07:14] <Mathman> qasim: hmm, that wouldn't mean it's not your makefile that's screwed up somehow I don't think.  I mean, at least try something real simple.  does make even work for that?
[07:14] <chris_420> fde solve both my probs with the notification area haha
[07:14] <musikgoat> pen well thats fine anyways
[07:14] <zedster_> anyone able to help me?
[07:14] <pen> musikgoat: maybe I should wait for it to start?
[07:14] <ushimitsudoki> RedScare: not yet. I wanted to see if there was anything out there about this (or possibly strange input issues)
[07:14] <fde> chris_420: Wait, it's not... heh... try 'nm-applet &' in a terminal
[07:14] <musikgoat> pen: 20 seconds goes pretty quickly... but yes
[07:15] <fde> chris_420: hah... that works... now to figure out why my nm-applet died  :P
[07:15] <chris_420> i have NM applet on one of my bars already and the "signal" chart is not working haha
[07:16] <grayKot> how to start some application in desk 2 while, i'm at desk 1 ?
[07:16] <pen> musikgoat: it works
[07:16] <Mathman> Tazbobu: ubuntu isn't the only distro on the block you know.  but then again, yeah, it's not going to be perfect on every single setup.  but then in ubuntu's defense, they can't ship nvidia junk out of the box I don't think, so yeah, figure it out.
[07:16] <Tazbobu> any simple way to fix my nvidia driver?  it says it is there and running but I can't access any of the nvidia settings
[07:16] <chris_420> fde sorry bout the death of your NM
[07:16] <musikgoat> pen: cool
[07:16] <fde> chris_420: It's ok, the command I told you to get it back does in fact work  :)
[07:16] <pen> musikgoat: ok, now I'm goign to test it real
[07:16] <musikgoat> pen ok
[07:17] <fde> chris_420: No harm no foul  :)
[07:17] <Tazbobu> Mathman: my point is, as long as Ubuntu has been around, you would think they could get it to install right on the first time with the most popular video cards in the world.
[07:17] <chris_420> fde: lol true...
[07:17] <chris_420> well now back to getting my appearance right lol all the issues so far are out of the way.... now time to make it look pretty haha
[07:17] <Mathman> Tazbobu: ubuntu hasn't been around very long
[07:18] <fde> chris_420: Take a look around www.gnome-look.org
[07:18] <Mathman> eh, computer years, I suppose it's been around a while, but still.
[07:18] <chris_420> HAHAAAAAA  FDE thats the one place i always look to
[07:18] <chris_420>  trying to find a light or white wallpaper as we speak lol
[07:18] <Mathman> Tazbobu: my answer?  try mandriva
[07:18] <fde> Mathman: still only 4 years or so...
[07:19] <zedster_> anyone why if I run modprobe psmouse, after stopping it, would my touchpad work for a few seconds and then stop?
[07:19] <iRRVi> i need...my bluetooth mouse...to work
[07:19] <Mathman> fde: ha, spose it might be that long at that.  time flies
[07:19] <chris_420> FDE i got inspired to go all white with my appearance... from a music video haha
[07:19] <RedScare> maybe someone knows how enable multiple desktop wallpapers on different workspaces in gnome?
[07:19] <AgentHeX> !virt-manager
[07:19] <ubottu> Factoid virt-manager not found
[07:19] <ushimitsudoki> Tazbobu: Which drivers are you trying to use? nv or nvidia?
[07:19] <fde> Mathman: first release was December '04... hence Warty is 4.10
[07:20] <fde> November too
[07:20] <RedScare> because I run virtualbox XP on my second workspace seamlessly
[07:20] <RedScare> and would like a wallpaper to reflect this
[07:20] <iRRVi> 8.04...bluetooth mouse not working...followed the thing on the wiki sorta thing on the ubuntu site...to no avail >_< it shows as connected but it wont control the mouse
[07:20] <fde> Or October... I need coffee
[07:20] <Tazbobu> Mathman: I don't really want to switch, it is just a pain to have to redo my video, wine, network, moblock, etc
[07:20] <Mathman> fde: ha, 3 and a half almost then
[07:20] <fde> Mathman: Plus the time it spent as no-name.org getting up and running...
[07:20] <chris_420> aight im outty.... laters peoples
[07:20] <Mathman> Tazbobu: suit yourself.  I'm just pointing out there are other options you may not have explored
[07:21] <RedScare> interfacelift.com may have an acceptable background
[07:21] <Tazbobu> ushimitsudoki: I've tried both.. neither one shows me the proper resolutions.. I have tried selecting the monitor by detecting it, also tried plug and play, also tried selecting my actual monitor.. no configuration is showing the proper resolutions
[07:21] <musikgoat> pen: did it work?
[07:21] <x1250> When is #ubuntu+1 coming back?
[07:21] <pen> musikgoat: yea. it works
[07:21] <pen> musikgoat: thx
[07:21] <RedScare> closer to october
[07:21] <musikgoat> yw
[07:21] <bleedingmoon> if i got an hard disk with serveral partitions i can install ubuntu on one of them and it wont damage the rest, right?
[07:22] <fde> x1250: It is likely there currently, but not active due to hardy and intrepid being exactly the same currently...
[07:22] <zedster_> bleedingmoon: yes, unless one of them is visit in which case the mbr is a pain in the rear
[07:22] <zedster_> bleedingmoon: you need like neo grub or something to do it
[07:22] <ushimitsudoki> Tazbobu: I use the drivers from nvidia, not from restricted. Have you been able to install those?
[07:22] <x1250> they're not exactly the same anymore, intrepid is already broken :)
[07:22] <bleedingmoon> i cant fix it with the windows cd?
[07:22] <Tazbobu> bleedingmoon: and a health portion of luck or patience
[07:23] <fde> x1250: The devs generally relax until after the sprints or whatever... the developer meetings...
[07:23] <Mathman> zedster_: you sure about that.  a plain old grub, least I thought it was a plain old grub, worked just fine with a vista dual boot setup for one of the jerks over here.
[07:23] <Finnish_> What tool to use in Gimp, if I want borders of picture smoother? Sort of making them black against background?
[07:23] <Tazbobu> ushimitsudoki: from the actual nvidia site or just installed from synaptic?
[07:23] <Mathman> zedster_: you meant vista, right?
[07:23] <ebroder> Does anyone know anything about getting the mga video driver to work on Hardy?
[07:23] <Lapinux> can someone help me figure out what device my UPS is on?
[07:23] <iRRVi> in 8.04 my bluetooth mouse shows as connected but when i try to move the cursor with it, it doesnt work >_<
[07:23] <ebroder> I have a driver that worked with Gutsy and doesn't anymore
[07:23] <bleedingmoon> Tazbobu, i got 2 windows partitions, C & D, i wanna install ubuntu on D
[07:23] <Mathman> Lapinux: sounds like a job for "dmesg"
[07:23] <ushimitsudoki> Tazbobu: from the actual nvidia site. I didn't have any luck with nv or the ones the restricted manager tried to apply
[07:24] <astro76> Lapinux: USB?
[07:24] <Lapinux> Mathman: ok, let me take a look and see if i can spot it
[07:24] <Lapinux> astro76: yes
[07:24] <Tazbobu> ushimitsudoki: thanks i'll try that
[07:24] <legolasw> Hi
[07:24] <bleedingmoon> it will damage my MBR?
[07:24] <bleedingmoon> and how i fix it
[07:24] <Lapinux> astro76: well maybe
[07:24] <grayKot> <unconvertable> /msg ubottu etiquette
[07:24] <astro76> Lapinux: right after you plug it in type dmesg, it should say
[07:24] <N1N31NCHN41L6> ok using Super Grub i found a menu that shows both ubuntu(hd0,0) and puppy(hd0,4)  what shall i do to get puppy grubbed up and not kill ubuntu
[07:24] <legolasw> Can I ask something unrelated to Ubuntu?
[07:24] <RedScare> Taz
[07:24] <Nervetatoo> I have problems getting sound to work in 8.04. Installed form scratch on an asus u2e which has a intel ICH8. There are no errors and all playback software seems to function normaly except there is no sound output ofc
[07:24] <ushimitsudoki> Tazbobu: hold on let me give a like with a guide. because it is a bit tricky...looking for the link now
[07:24] <musikgoat> bleedingmoon: which version of windows do you have?
[07:24] <bleedingmoon> xp
[07:25] <bleedingmoon> both
[07:25] <RedScare> yes, a guide would be agood
[07:25] <Lapinux> astro76: its a serial to usb
[07:25] <musikgoat> it'll be fine then
[07:25] <bleedingmoon> ok
[07:25] <bleedingmoon> :D
[07:25] <legolasw> I bought something from Amazon and I used my CC number for the payment. Does it reduce the order cost from my CC at once?
[07:25] <musikgoat> bleedingmoon: grub will install and give you the choice of which OS to boot
[07:25] <Lapinux> astro76: looks like a rj45 connector on one end
[07:25] <RedScare> you just need to install grub on the guided setup process honestly
[07:25] <bleedingmoon> grub?
[07:25] <iRRVi> logolasw: you can...might not be appreciated, or acted kindly upon...but theres nothing stopping you
[07:25] <musikgoat> bleedingmoon: the bootloader
[07:25] <bleedingmoon> ok
[07:25] <musikgoat> !grub
[07:25] <ubottu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[07:25] <RedScare> its part of the install package when you install ubuntu
[07:25] <astro76> Lapinux: if it's APC they use proprietary cables but it's still USB
[07:26] <tushar> hi all
[07:26] <Lapinux> astro76: yes apc
[07:26] <ushimitsudoki> Tazbobu: Here is a guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual  It is helpful to make sure you disable the nv and restricted manager stuff, which always seems to want to override the nvidia drivers
[07:26] <Beefeater> Good morning fellas! Is there any log where I can see if a laptop lid has been closed?
[07:26] <Lapinux> astro76: should i see it specify apc in dmesg
[07:26] <Tazbobu> bleedingmoon: as long as your xp partitions are on just one physical drive and the MBR is on that drive grub will set it up all nice for you
[07:26] <iRRVi> in 8.04 my bluetooth mouse is not working...could be the mouse...but idk...any ideas?
[07:26] <tehk> Can anyone tell me how I would go about turning my capslock into an additional control key in the __console__, the old method using /etc/console-tools/remap doesnt work
[07:26] <astro76> Lapinux: it will be the last few lines of the output, after you plug it in
[07:26] <bleedingmoon> ok
[07:27] <RedScare> After you've installed Ubuntu, it will automatically setup a boot option for XP then you can go in a modify any aesthetics you want inside ubuntu
[07:27] <legend> hello everyone
[07:27] <Tazbobu> I had my MBR on a secondary drive once and grub misconfigured everything it was a pain to figure out

[07:28] <NemesisD> question, i think hardy installs .24 kernel, gutsy i had .22. i think i kept the old menu.lst and i suspect thats why i'm having problems, anyone have any ideas?
[07:28] <iRRVi> i really dont want to buy a usb mouse...my laptop has no PS/2 ports so i cant use any of my current ones...anyone can help me with my bluetooth problem, it would be much appreciated (the one i've asked like 5 times...)
[07:28] <Lapinux> astro76: in this apcupsd config i have it wants a /dev/tty
[07:28] <RedScare> what problems again?
[07:28] <surplusxmas> Can I ask Kubuntu install questions here, or are they limited to #kubuntu?
[07:28] <RedScare> you can choose to overwrite the menu.lst @ time of install

[07:29] <NemesisD> redarrow, can't load my restricted nvidia drivers properly, also my twinview is gone
[07:29] <NemesisD> whoops, RedScare *
[07:29] <NemesisD> also im past the point of install
[07:29] <N1N31NCHN41L6> i told it to boot (hda0,4) which is puppy and it still loaded my ubuntu (hdao,0)
[07:29] <Lapinux> astro76: you make anything of that?
[07:29] <RedScare> yea, this has been a reoccurring problem Nemeiss

[07:30] <anacaona_> hello hello. did a manual upgrade from gutsy to heron (via the alternate CD). apache is acting weird since - i've tried restarting the server and get the message: No apache MPM package installed.
[07:30] <mkquist> i seem to have lost the maximize/minimize/close buttons on my browser and applications, anyone know what causes that or if there is a setting i've missed? also cant seem to drag things arouond anymore..

[07:31] <ebroder> Anyone know about getting the Matrox G400 to work with Hardy?
[07:31] <RedScare> Nemesis, your boot line needs to point to the new kernel
[07:31] <fde> anacaona_: If you did a fresh install, you'll have to reinstall apache etc... I hope you did backups
[07:31] <Lapinux> astro76: thanks, i will see if i can make anything of it
[07:31] <RedScare> very honestly, reinstalling grub alone maybe a good way to resolve the issue
[07:31] <NemesisD> redarrow, i tried changing all mentions of .22 to .24 and i got file not found
[07:31] <NeoGeo64> the default ubuntu theme is so boring
[07:31] <magnetron> NeoGeo64: then don't use it

[07:32] <raybr> hey guys, i just downloaded a skype-debian_2.0.0.68-1_i386.deb from skype.com but am not sure how to install it, can someone please help?

[07:32] <NemesisD> RedScare, i'm in kind of a tricky situation, i need to use windows bootloader to boot properly, i cannot have grub touch my MBR
[07:32] <zedster1> this is zedster, my computer went nutz, sudo modprobe psmouse makes my touchpad work for a second then it stops any ideas?
[07:32] <NemesisD> RedScare, im fine with it doing anything to the /boot directory but it cannot affect my mbr
[07:32] <RedScare> is there a particular reason nemesis?
[07:32] <fde> NeoGeo64: Defaults are supposed to be changed  :)

[07:33] <shashi__> In Ubuntu, when you install a package either through "ADD/Remove" or "Synaptic" , where it will keep the downloaded packages ?
[07:33] <legolasw> Is there any way to see VPN connection debug messages or log file?
[07:33] <zedster1> NemesisD: theres a program for windows neogrub I think will help with that
[07:33] <NeoGeo64> right now im now even using the GUI
[07:33] <NemesisD> RedScare, wonky drive setup, don't want to get into it besides the fact that it took me 2-3 days to get it working this way and i dont have the time or inclination to go through that again
[07:33] <RedScare> understandable
[07:33] <NemesisD> eh i don't need help with that part of it, im ok with using ntldr, it has an option for ubuntu which then loads grub, so its all good

[07:38] <ackbahr> I'm using an ATI card with Hardy, and I've got the choice between my widescreen being aknowledged (1280x768) but without graphical acceleration (when the proprietary driver is ENABLED), or graphical accel in 1024x768 (when the driver is DISABLED). Can somebody help get both?
[07:38] <Lapinux> astro76: yeah, i just spotted that in the config, thing is its serial on one end and usb on the other
[07:38] <sc006> anyone have problems with 8.04 and ut2004 graphics?
=== Bob_Sagot is now known as dev-null

[07:42] <maco> Y-Town: system ->preferences ->sound
[07:42] <vinboy> is there application that shows what programs is using up the bandwidth?
[07:42] <anacaona_> fde: sorry, stepped away for a bit. its not a fresh install, its an upgrade from gutsy.

[07:43] <Y-Town> maco: Thanks though  :o)'
[07:43] <oddalot> wait
[07:43] <oddalot> nope
[07:43] <vinboy> oddalot: sys mon only show cpu and mem
[07:43] <zedster1> why would sudo modprobe psmouse make my touchpad work for a second and then stop? and why would an xorg reset not help?
[07:43] <oddalot> it shows network, just no detailed
[07:44] <surplusxmas_> 8.04 installation error: "select and install software installation step failed"  any suggestions?
[07:44] <fde> anacaona_: I'm not too familiar with Apache, you might want to try #ubuntu-server
[07:45] <NemesisD> hey RedScare it appears the driver is go!
[07:45] <astro76> vinboy: iftop
[07:45] <astro76> vinboy: install that package, then sudo iftop
[07:45] <vinboy> thanks astro76

[07:47] <legolasw> Anyone interested in testing VPN connection problems?
[07:48] <magnetron> ask, legolasw
[07:48] <anacaona_> fde: thanks, will check that out.
[07:48] <ebroder> Does anyone know how to get the tuxx-home.at Matrox MGA drivers to work with Hardy?
[07:50] <nickthorley> bazhang: are you around?
[07:50] <legolasw> I have user/pass and IP address of VPN gateway and it does not connect
[07:50] <hogne> Hey
[07:50] <hogne> I've had many times now that I can't kill processes in Hardy
[07:50] <legolasw> problem is that It does not shows any meaningful error about the reason that it does not connect
[07:50] <hogne> Now eclipse locked and I get from ps: "7117 ?        00:00:01 eclipse"
[07:50] <iRRVi> eff this, i just use this usb mouse i have for my desktop :D
[07:50] <hogne> I can't sudo kill -9 it, can't sudo killall eclipse it
[07:51] <hogne> I had this yesterday also
[07:51] <hogne> Only thing that works is to reboot
[07:51] <jingjing> when ubuntu7.10 expire support?
[07:51] <nickthorley> is there a dissadvantage to using ndis to get your wireless card working such as speed or battery life etc
[07:51] <hogne> The process uses no cpu
[07:51] <clarity> http://www.danish-schnapps-recipes.com/cinnamon.html
[07:51] <clarity> err
[07:51] <clarity> sorry
[07:51] <fde> nickthorley: Only real issue these days is no utilization of NetworkManager (no easy roaming)
[07:52] <harry_> anyone here who can help me with a couple of ubuntu problems?
[07:52] <hogne> Anyone know how to kill a process beyond using the kill command, or know some special funky way to do it?
[07:52] <jingjing> when ubuntu 7.10 desktop expire support time??
[07:52] <DistroJockey> jingjing, April 2009
[07:52] <nickthorley> fde: so you cant search for access points - you have to manually add them?
[07:52] <legolasw> Any comment?@ <magnetron>
[07:52] <harry_> hogne: after kill -9, there is none
[07:52] <harry_> unless it's a zombie: kill the parent
[07:52] <hogne> harry_: is it a bug in the hardy kernel?
[07:52] <fde> nickthorley: Yes, it's treated as a wired connection as far as the system is concerned.
[07:52] <harry_> reaper will fix the rest
[07:52] <harry_> hogne: don't know actually
[07:53] <harry_> i have a few problems
[07:53] <hogne> harry: How do I see the process tree?
[07:53] <harry_> pstree
[07:53] <tuntun> gparted and qtparted report that I have 'no devices' I tried root but neither of them are doing anything. Whats wrong?
[07:53] <lethalamby> My RAM usage shown in top and system monitor is totally different. Top says I am using up over a gig of ram while sys monitor says about 600MB. Any ideas why. It was like this yesterday also
[07:53] <jumbers> I updated to Hardy and my sound stopped working. I went to the Dell Wiki and followed its information for restoring the sound, and it still won't work
[07:53] <hogne> harry_: eclipse runs on init
[07:53] <nickthorley> fde: ok i can compromise on that for the time being just to get my wireless working - i am hoping a fix for my card will be out soon as it is one of the main ones
[07:54] <harry_> hogne: whats the status of eclipse?
[07:54] <jingjing> DistroJockey: thankyou! , on 8.04 desktop resolution very low (800*600) but 7.10 have have 1024*768
[07:54] <legolasw> Any comment?@ <magnetron>
[07:54] <RedScare> NemeisD
[07:54] <magnetron> legolasw: if anyone knows, they will answer.
[07:54] <hogne> harry_: How do I see it?
[07:54] <harry_> ps aux | grep eclipse
[07:54] <lethalamby> RedScare, NemesisD offline
[07:54] <RedScare> is he
[07:54] <DistroJockey> jingjing, *nods* have seen many say that. Might be worth searching launchpad.net about that
[07:55] <NemesisD> no im not
[07:55] <legolasw> If I give you my user and pass, can you test it? @ megatron
[07:55] <RedScare> he should be back
[07:55] <hogne> harry_: hogne     7117  0.2  1.8 426404 75780 ?        D    08:47   0:01 /home/hogne/Programs/eclipse/eclipse
[07:55] <nickthorley> whats the main site to log ubuntu bugs ?
[07:55] <NemesisD> RedScare, it works now, turned out i wrote the path wrong in menu.lst
[07:55] <astro76> tuntun: running them from your installed system or livecd?
[07:55] <RedScare> NemesisD, you said the drive was a good
[07:55] <NemesisD> using the new kernel seems to fix everything
[07:55] <tuntun> astro76, installed
[07:55] <harry_> so it's dead... give it a : kill -9 7117
[07:55] <RedScare> yea, I was just about to say
[07:55] <astro76> tuntun: wubi?
[07:55] <harry_> and hope for the best
[07:55] <magnetron> legolasw: no. and it's magnetron, not megatron
[07:55] <lethalamby> My RAM usage shown in top and system monitor is totally different. Top says I am using up over a gig of ram while sys monitor says about 600MB. Any ideas why. It was like this yesterday also
[07:55] <tuntun> astro76, no
[07:55] <harry_> it might be stuck in a non interruptible IO
[07:55] <nickthorley> nemesisd: wish it would fix my wireless card haha
[07:55] <harry_> which is blocked for some reason
[07:55] <hogne> harry_: : hogne     7117  0.2  1.8 426404 75780 ?        D    08:47   0:01 /home/hogne/Programs/eclipse/eclipse
[07:55] <lethalamby> RedScare,  Any idea why this happening with me
[07:55] <hogne> harry_: still there
[07:56] <NemesisD> lol
[07:56] <NemesisD> bummer
[07:56] <RedScare> 24-16 it what you should be on
[07:56] <djdarkman> hello, if the restricted driver manager doens`t manage to set up the firmware(broadcom) how can I run it manualy trough the terminal?
[07:56] <hogne> harry_: I got this exact same with nautilus yesterday and had to reboot..
[07:56] <astro76> tuntun: what do you have? what does sudo fdisk -l show?
[07:56] <harry_> hogne: depending on your asm skills, you can attach a debugger to it
[07:56] <hogne> harry_: I don't have asm skills =)
[07:56] <harry_> and play around ... see what it's doing
[07:56] <hogne> harry_: sorry..
[07:56] <legolasw> Sorry for mis-spell. Thanks.
[07:56] <MrPockets> djdarkman, what firmware are you trying to upgrade?
[07:56] <hogne> harry_: then my only last resort is to reboot?
[07:56] <harry_> then i'm affraid i can 't help you further
[07:57] <harry_> just leave it :)
[07:57] <tuntun> astro76, 6 partitions
[07:57] <harry_> it might just die after a while
[07:57] <lethalamby> RedScare, tell me some other ubuntu channels . Need lots of answers
[07:57] <hogne> harry_: can't leave it, its splash screen is on my desktop
[07:57] <tuntun> astro76, over 2 discs
[07:57] <harry_> xkill?
[07:57] <harry_> doesn't xkill remove it?
[07:57] <hogne> harry_: gonna try
[07:58] <hogne> harry_: yes it removed it, the process is still there though
[07:58] <astro76> tuntun: fdisk showed them?
[07:58] <billy12> djdark: flower thw server intrsurtions
[07:58] <hogne> harry_: shall I post a bug report on the ubuntu forums?
[07:58] <tuntun> astro76, yes
[07:58] <harry_> can anyone help with my problem: i have a ipw2200 wifi card, when i boot, it doesn't see my wpa2 wifi network, i can't connect to it
[07:58] <dfranke> Hi, I've just grudgingly switched from Debian stable to Hardy and I'd like to configure my sources.list to feed me nothing besides security updates.  Is hardy-updates the best I can get, or is there something more stable available?
[07:58] <RedScare> lethallamby
[07:58] <RedScare> lethalamby
[07:58] <harry_> hogne: don't know if it's a ubuntu problem or an eclipse problem
[07:58] <lethalamby> RedScare, ya
[07:59] <white_eagle> ok, guys I have problems in here
[07:59] <white_eagle> I have a half working hardy system
[07:59] <djdarkman> MrPockets: I have a friend who has trouble installing the broadcom wireless firmware trough the restricted drivers manager, and I would like to give him the command line commands instead
[07:59] <RedScare> AFAIK, they just have different ways to show used memory
[07:59] <Uplink> ubuntu wont load my broadcom drivers :(
[07:59] <astro76> dfranke: you want hardy-security and hardy-updates
[07:59] <RedScare> To get similar values, take the 'used' from top, and subtract 'buffers' and 'cached'
[07:59] <dfranke> There are a bunch of commented out security.ubuntu.com entries, but if I uncomment them then apt-get update hangs.
[08:00] <billy12> djdark: what ubuntu you have
[08:00] <diagon> I'm having problems with my laptop shutting down, I think due to overheating
[08:00] <white_eagle> look, I am logged in as root, because I cant do anything from my account because I can't sudo, and when i do sudo I get that the host (whiteeagle-laptop) is unknown
[08:00] <RedScare> SM only the apps
[08:00] <diagon> I'm sure there's an easy way to adjust the temp at which the fan should kick in, right?
[08:00] <white_eagle> please tell me how can I fix it from here
[08:00] <dfranke> astro76: I *think* I only want hardy-security, but as I just said it doesn't seem to work.
[08:00] <lethalamby> RedScare,
[08:00] <tuntun> dfranke, system > administration > synaptic > settings > repositories > updates ?...
[08:00] <lethalamby> My RAM usage shown in top and system monitor is totally different. Top says I am using up over a gig of ram while sys monitor says about 600MB. Any ideas why. It was like this yesterday also
[08:01] <white_eagle> hello?
[08:01] <dfranke> tuntun: this is server edition, I don't have a GUI yet.
[08:01] <RedScare> right, this is because TOP factors in everything, SM only factors APPs
[08:01] <RedScare> you are in fact using over a gig total
[08:01] <olskolirc> hey guys, I installed a tar.gz of xmms and now I see we have xmms2 in the Hardy Heron repository.  How do I uninstall my xmms....tar.gz?
[08:01] <astro76> dfranke: well there's no reason not to enable main, universe, multiverse or restricted, as  they don't change
[08:01] <lethalamby> RedScare, You mean ubuntu is using more than a GB of RAM. Ubuntu ultimate
[08:01] <dfranke> astro76: right, I've got those.  But I don't want non-security-related bugfixes.
[08:02] <astro76> dfranke: so what happens with -updates disabled ?
[08:02] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, edit /etc/hosts and make sure you have both a 127.0.0.1 line and a 127.0.1.1
[08:02] <RedScare> yes, I'm assuming you're running compiz-fusion
[08:02] <Uplink> ubuntu wont load my broadcom drivers :(
[08:02] <RedScare> broadcom hates me uplink
[08:02] <dfranke> astro76: exactly what you'd expect.  But if I enable -security, things hang.  I don't know whether the server is just down or what.
[08:02] <white_eagle> http://rafb.net/p/x7jW2z38.txt
[08:02] <white_eagle> see that
[08:02] <white_eagle> I have dependency problems
[08:02] <hogne> doesn't the fact that userland processes can enter an unkillable "D" state beat the purpose of protected memory?
[08:03] <white_eagle> the update was interrupted by some error
[08:03] <Uplink> RedScare, it detects em but failes to load them
[08:03] <hogne> could have just as well run AmigaOS! =)
[08:03] <white_eagle> i was upgrading to hardy
[08:03] <b0x> how can i find out wat version of ubuntu i have

[08:05] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: I don't want to mess up, please edit that file
[08:05] <RedScare> yes, after a clean install :)
[08:05] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, yep right at the top
[08:05] <harry_> is there anyone here who knows what can be done about a broken remote problem?
[08:05] <RedScare> Harry, describe the specific WPA2 problem you're having
[08:05] <pawan> hi
[08:06] <pawan> how to repair grub
[08:06] <harry_> RedScare: in gutsy, i had to remove 85-ifupdown from udev.d/rules.d
[08:06] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, here's mine as a guide:  http://pastebin.com/f5e58e2f1
[08:06] <harry_> well... disable, then it worked at boottime
[08:06] <pawan> i installed vista and it removed my grub
[08:06] <harry_> now, i upgraded (restored the udev crap_
[08:06] <HermanChess> where can I see my hardware?
[08:06] <harry_> and now, when i reboot, it doesn't see my network
[08:06] <pawan> but ubuntu is installed but cant select it
[08:06] <harry_> if i click and edit networks, its there
[08:06] <Matic`Makovec> Hello there. I remember Gutsy Gibbon having an awesome application for handing .bin files (it practically mounted it, but it was great). Now after I upgraded to Hardy I don't have it anymore and so I'm woundering what would that kind of thing be called?
[08:07] <RedScare> pawan, install EasyBCD inside vista too manage it
[08:07] <harry_> but there's no way to tell it to connect to that config
[08:07] <RedScare> please continue harry
[08:07] <alienseer23> i have 3 partitions mounted in "/media/" that belong to "root:plugdev" and have pretty restricctive permissions, but all of my media is on them, I cannot get to it, "sudo chown" and "sudo chmod" have no effect... how can I fix this?
[08:07] <RedScare> hm
[08:07] <dfranke> astro76: ah, now it's working.  Guess the server was just down.
[08:07] <astro76> HermanChess: lshw, lspci, lsusb
[08:07] <harry_> so now, i removed the ifupdown rule again
[08:07] <pawan> where to get easybcd
[08:07] <harry_> and manually do a /etc/init.d/network restart
[08:07] <RedScare> BCD Easy
[08:07] <harry_> and it connects
[08:07] <RedScare> free download
[08:07] <ferronica> hi all

[08:07] <RedScare> what a pain that must be harry
[08:07] <harry_> it's a ipw2200
[08:07] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: and what should I add at the right side of the second numbers?
[08:08] <white_eagle> whiteeagle-laptop?
[08:08] <harry_> does give me a "strange" error in dmesg tough
[08:08] <RedScare> I'm on iwl3945
[08:08] <astro76> dfranke: cool
[08:08] <hogne> Man
[08:08] <harry_> [  221.971060] ipw2200: Failed to send SYSTEM_CONFIG: Already sending a command.
[08:08] <hogne> ls crashed and I can't kill it
[08:08] <hogne> wow
[08:08] <hogne> this is bad
[08:08] <RedScare> is that a proprietary driver harry?
[08:08] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, yourhostname.domainname  yourhostname
[08:08] <harry_> think so
[08:08] <pawan> where to get itr
[08:08] <ferronica> i have downloded ubuntu 8.04 ISO image after burning, checking integrity fail
[08:08] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: how am I supposed to know tat?
[08:08] <white_eagle> that*
[08:08] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, replacing with values appropriate
[08:09] <RedScare> http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1
[08:09] <white_eagle> ohhh
[08:09] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: oh
[08:09] <dfranke> alright, now to get X working with my three displays.  I had a nice hand-written xorg.config on my old system that I forgot to back up :-(
[08:09] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, just make something up, should be fine
[08:09] <white_eagle> and If I don't have a host name
[08:09] <astro76> ferronica: check the md5sum of the iso you downloaded, if that's good, burn at a slower speed
[08:09] <astro76> !md5 | ferronica
[08:09] <ubottu> ferronica: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[08:09] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, can't be any worse than it is now :)
[08:09] <Twigman> Hi All... can't start hardy installer :-/
[08:10] <harry_> RedScare: ?
[08:10] <RedScare> can you check harry, under the GUI System>Admin>Hardware Drivers
[08:10] <harry_> ah
[08:10] <ferronica> astro76: MD5SUM is okay
[08:10] <lethalamby> RedScare, I checked system monitor docs. It mentions clearly that it shows total memory usage. And its usage seems more realistic also.
[08:10] <Twigman> This is on a Dell Vostro - fairly common piece of hardware..
[08:10] <diagon> Okay, so acpitool shows my laptop's thermal trip at 105 C
[08:10] <lethalamby> I am not running any application that will take 1 GB RAM
[08:10] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: so it looks like this http://pastebin.com/m4723c1b0
[08:10] <Twigman> I'm being dumped into busybox....
[08:10] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: is it ok?
[08:11] <RedScare> really lethal? I find that buffers and cached aren't typically included on mine
[08:11] <diagon> also I've found out that toshiba kernel stuff isn't loaded, and I tried some shot-in-the-dark "modprobe -l |grep toshiba" and then tried just adding it, didn't seem to work
[08:11] <harry_> ah
[08:11] <harry_> no , only my nvidia driver
[08:11] <astro76> lethalamby: I would trust free -m
[08:11] <bobbie4> I'm going to bed now, g'nite
[08:11] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, yep that looks fine. But I guess, technically  localhost  should be changed to  whiteeagle
[08:11] <diagon> so all I need to know is how to lower the thermal trip that's shown in the /proc/acpi stuff
[08:12] <lethalamby> astro76, I just started my PC
[08:12] <Twigman> Anyone heard of problems getting the Hardy install cd to boot? I'm being dropped into a busybox shell..
[08:12] <pawan> installed now
[08:12] <jmsp3> Could anyone tell me what's wrong with mounting a windows ntfs partition automatically with /etc/fstab?
[08:12] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: is it ok?
[08:12] <white_eagle> oh
[08:12] <white_eagle> sorry
[08:12] <white_eagle> ;)
[08:12] <FloodBot1> white_eagle: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:12] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, np :)
[08:12] <RedScare> so non-proprietary really shouldn't be giving you that sort of problem harry
[08:12] <RedScare> hang on
[08:12] <lethalamby> 1963 MB of RAM usage
[08:12] <harry_> that's my opinion aswell ;)
[08:12] <lethalamby> this is shown by free -m
[08:12] <legolasw> Anyone interested in testing VPN connection problems?
[08:13] <legolasw>  Is there any way to see VPN connection debug messages or log file?
[08:13] <RedScare> is that wlan0 harry?
[08:13] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: and can I fix those dependency problems?
[08:13] <astro76> lethalamby: how much is cached?
[08:13] <lethalamby> 1307
[08:13] <harry_> not that i changed an aweful lot, but i don't want to reinstall ;)
[08:13] <rpedro_> anybody else getting slow file copying speeds between different physical hdd's?
[08:13] <harry_> especially my mythbox
[08:13] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: http://pastebin.com/m2194be0e
[08:14] <rpedro_> compared to gutsy
[08:14] <lethalamby> and swap not used. Still almost 2 gigs of RAm used when running nothing significant :(
[08:14] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, possibly, that hosts issue may have been the cause. Give it onther try
[08:14] <knoppix> I had been here earlier asking about why ubuntu sets up partitions as sda1 sda2 and sda5. I gatered that it creates two primary partitions with an extended partition sda5 for swap that really occupies all of sda3. is that correct?
[08:14] <lethalamby> astro76, swap usage shown 0
[08:14] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: yes!
[08:14] <knoppix> sorry sda2 not 3
[08:15] <RedScare> oh hell
[08:15] <astro76> lethalamby: first off, system monitor only shows your user processes if not run as root
[08:15] <pawan> now
[08:15] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: lets hope so
[08:16] <Twigman> Anyone heard of problems getting the Hardy install cd to boot? I'm being dropped into a busybox shell.. I get a lot of messages from ata2.00 saying status: { DRDY } (and other messages)
[08:16] <pawan> i am in vista my grub is lost
[08:16] <lethalamby> astro76, Now the problem is I want to know why is so much RAM being used. I have run linux on 256 MB RAm also. If I have 2Gb it should not mean it occupies all :(
[08:16] <pawan> i have ubuntu installed
[08:16] <olskolirc> can I get the pastebin address please?
[08:16] <lethalamby> pawan: boot from CD
[08:17] <lethalamby> http://paste.ubuntu.com
[08:17] <pawan> then
[08:17] <lethalamby> there is a section in ubuntu docs
[08:17] <olskolirc> thanks
[08:17] <lethalamby> read that and you'll be fine
[08:17] <Boredom_inc> Wow, since a couple of days after my 8.04 update, ubntu has been running really sluggish. I was making a bug report
[08:17] <pawan> ok
[08:17] <DistroJockey> Twigman, yes, I have seen that issue brought up a few times. Maybe try the Alternate CD if you just wish to install to HDD
[08:17] <Boredom_inc> Ubuntu*
[08:18] <Twigman> DistroJockey: thanks for the reply. Will the alternate be able to boot?
[08:18] <Daniel^> just got a message about a new distribution upgrade, is that a good idea?
[08:18] <harry_> Daniel^: NO
[08:18] <Daniel^> ok :)
[08:18] <Uplink> ubuntu wont load my broadcom drivers :(
[08:18] <Twigman> I just got an error: synchronous SCSI scan failed without making any progress,
[08:18] <ikonia> Uplink: expand on that please.
[08:18] <Uplink> sure
[08:18] <DistroJockey> Twigman, not entirely sure (might be worth checking launchpad.net for the issue) but it generally works better
[08:19] <Boredom_inc> When I was making the bug report I noticed Ubuntu is not recognising my swap partition. It says utilising 0 of 0 bytes. Is this the cause of my sluggish performance (I still have 50% RAM) or is it something else. Either way how do I make Ubuntu aware of my swap partition again.
[08:19] <Uplink> <i load the ubuntu live cd and my broadcom drivers fail to load on startup>
[08:19] <lethalamby> someone help me
[08:19] <olskolirc> can someone help me with my xmms issue? http://paste.ubuntu.com/8848/plain/ I can't get it to execute.
[08:19] <Twigman> ok sounds good... It actually looks like it doesn't like my cdrom drive..
[08:19] <ikonia> Boredom_inc: it only uses swap when you need it
[08:19] <lethalamby> my ubuntu using up 2 GB of RAM
[08:19] <ikonia> Uplink: how do you know ?
[08:19] <knoppix> how does upgrading to 8.04 affect VMware if you already have that installed. I hear 8.04 has a new kernel
[08:19] <Twigman> Btw.. this is a new pc, so it may have some later hardware..
=== lymeca_ is now known as lymeca
[08:19] <ikonia> knoppix: depends on the compatability
[08:19] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: I know this but shouldn't it say something like 0 bytes of .... bytes used rather than 0 of 0?
[08:20] <Uplink> it tells me on the screen when loading the drivers>
[08:20] <ikonia> Boredom_inc: show me the exact message
[08:20] <olskolirc> can someone help me with my xmms issue? http://paste.ubuntu.com/8848/plain/ I can't get it to execute.  I'm on Hardy Heron
[08:20] <ikonia> olskolirc: where did you get xmms - it's not in hardy
[08:20] <knoppix> ikonia: how so?
[08:20] <lethalamby> please some one help me reduce RAM usage. I feel RAM is not being freed..:(  here is a paste of my /proc/meminfo   http://paste.ubuntu.com/8850/
[08:20] <makiavelli> apt-get :D
[08:20] <dubby> hey anyone, i just went from gutsy kubuntu to hardy ubuntu and any ways kubuntu has this control panel thing to see what drives where connected to the system and then it mounted them for me, I was wondering if any such thing exists in Ubuntu?
[08:20] <DistroJockey> Twigman, possibly choosing something like legacy mode for sata/ide in bios may get the cd to boot
[08:20] <astro76> lethalamby: your ram usage is normal, and Linux is very intelligent with memory which you should know by running low ram systems
[08:21] <jk_> i am having a very annoying problem there seems to be glitches in my ubuntu, suddenly loose all sound from the system until i logoff or reboot, and when i open the wastebin nautlius jumps to 50% and becomes non-responsive any help?
[08:21] <ikonia> osiris: I can see a few issues, but I need to know where you got it
[08:21] <astro76> lethalamby: worry about it when you start swapping
[08:21] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: It's from the System manager... "0 bytes (0.0%) of 0 bytes".
[08:21] <astro76> !memory | lethalamby
[08:21] <ubottu> lethalamby: A quick FAQ on Memory Management: http://gentoo-wiki.com/FAQ_Linux_Memory_Management For Lubos Lunak's desktop memory usage comparison, see: http://ktown.kde.org/~seli/memory/desktop_benchmark.html
[08:21] <olskolirc> I got a copy from their web site as a tar.gz and it won't execute so I found we have xmms2 in Hardy Heron and it won't execute either ikonia
[08:21] <Uplink> <ikonia, it says "broacom 43.x.x drivers couldnt be loaded">
[08:21] <ikonia> Boredom_inc: thats fine
[08:21] <Twigman> DistroJockey: ok I'll look, however, the bios is pretty light on configuration..
[08:22] <DistroJockey> Twigman, *nods*
[08:22] <dubby> I have 2 hard-drives in this computer but I can only see the mount / can someone tell me how to view my other hard drive ( i do not know its device name like /dev/sdc1)
[08:22] <lethalamby> astro76, I always beleived Linux being superior to windows. But my total memory usage including swap has never gone above 1gig on windows
[08:22] <white_eagle> everyone, I am getting dependecy errors http://pastebin.com/m2194be0e\
[08:22] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: Do you have any ideas then as to what could be causing the performance issue. It was fine after I first rebooted 8.04 however it seems to have got steadily worse after each reboot. I'm still using the same nVidia drivers and nothing else (that I'm aware of) has changed since I updated from 7.10 to 8.04.
[08:23] <white_eagle> can you help me??
[08:23] <astro76> lethalamby: Linux doesn't waste the RAM you paid for, it keeps things in cache and frees when needed
[08:23] <white_eagle> I am logged in as root, because the primary account had problems with sudo
[08:23] <astro76> lethalamby: please read that first link ubottu gave you to understand
[08:23] <x1250> dubby: $ sudo fdisk -l maybe helps
[08:23] <Boredom_inc> white_eagle: You really shouldn't be logged in as root.
[08:23] <amrik> Hey are there any tutorials about coding C in emacs?
[08:23] <white_eagle> I have a half working hardy, half gutsy system
[08:23] <white_eagle> Boredom_inc: I must
[08:23] <lethalamby> astro76, waiting for it to open. 2nd one opened
[08:24] <Boredom_inc> white_eagle: Have you tried to create a new account?
[08:24] <white_eagle> Boredom_inc: because I can't do anything from my primary account
[08:24] <white_eagle> Boredom_inc: will that help?
[08:24] <ikonia> Boredom_inc:1 moment, I'm on the phone
[08:24] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: Thanks
[08:24] <Boredom_inc> <unconvertable> white_eagle: Possibly. If it does then you will know the problem is to do with that users settings.
[08:24] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, did fixing the hosts file not work?
[08:25] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: I haven't tried
[08:25] <white_eagle> rebooting
[08:25] <jim_beam> how do u add a session to gdm startup
[08:25] <white_eagle> should i?
[08:25] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, yes, reboot :)

[08:32] <DistroJockey> Boredom_inc, white_eagle had no 127.0.0.1 or 127.0.1.1 lines in /etc/hosts
[08:33] <ikonia> Uplink: broadcom drivers can't be loaded, is that message coming up in the restricted drivers tool ?
[08:33] <xxxxxxx> ikonia I am trying to get an app to work without a desktop
[08:33] <xxxxxxx> should i use the minimal?
[08:33] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: no
[08:33] <xxxxxxx> its only 9.5mb where does the os come from is it downloaded?
[08:33] <ArthurArchnix> Anyone know anything about this xserver crash when trying to play videos? I'm on Hardy, and this is a real bad bug. I have an intel GM955 card, and run metacity with compositing enabled. It happens about half the time when I click on a video file (avi, flash, so far) and it's never happened when I right-click and open. It's happened on Totem and VLC. And again, no error messages, no freezing. Immediate restart of the xserver
[08:33] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: the interenet
[08:33] <xxxxxxx> ok i thought so
[08:33] <DistroJockey> Boredom_inc, white_eagle : And I know from experience that that breaks sudo ;)
[08:34] <xukun> hi all
[08:34] <xxxxxxx> ikonia i am trying to have the system dedicated to xbmc-linux
=== _nikro is now known as nikro
[08:34] <xxxxxxx> just that one app
[08:34] <ikonia> strtok: define the crash
[08:34] <xxxxxxx> I need it to boot into it and shut down from it
[08:34] <ikonia> oops
[08:34] <ikonia> ArthurArchnix: define the crash pleas.e
[08:34] <Boredom_inc> Distrojockey: Has he fixed the hosts file yet then?
[08:34] <Jordan_U> xxxxxxx, Then just install the base system and install that one app
[08:34] <DistroJockey> Boredom_inc, I believe so
[08:34] <oddalot> Boredom_inc  HAH AH nice nick
[08:34] <xxxxxxx> so minimal.iso would be a good starting point?
[08:35] <ArthurArchnix> ikonia: I'm not sure what you mean. I click on a video. The screen briefly turns black, then I see GDM logout text, then GDM comes up asking me to login.
[08:35] <xukun> I have a new microsoft wireless keyboard, not all the keys are working. Is there a way to solve this this?
[08:35] <Uplink> ikonia, when i boot up the PC with the live cd, and its before the desktop loading
[08:35] <ikonia> ArthurArchnix: ok, so X resets totally
[08:35] <Boredom_inc> Distrojockey: Then it's probably something else.... is whiteeagle account listed as a sudoer?
[08:35] <Jordan_U> xxxxxxx, Yes, if you are comfortable setting things up from a command line
[08:35] <ikonia> Uplink: ahh, what model card have you got
[08:35] <Ace_NoOne> hi there - before upgrading to Hardy, I want to make an image of my entire HDD
[08:35] <Twigman> DistroJockey: Thanks for your help, turns out this is a problem that happens with some dell computers. Bug page is here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/153702
[08:35] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 153702 in linux-source-2.6.22 "Dell Inspiron 530 SATA drive not detected in IDE mode" [High,Won't fix]
[08:35] <DistroJockey> Boredom_inc, not sure, not got that far
[08:35] <Ace_NoOne> any advice on how best to do this - especially with regards to easy restoration in case something goes wrong?
[08:35] <bazhang> nickthorley: yeah, but only for a bit
[08:35] <ArthurArchnix> ikonia: Yeah. It's really wierd. It's basically like videos have been turned into a logout button without any prompts. But only sometimes.
[08:35] <Uplink> ikonia, im not quite sure... broamcom 4.3.X.X i think :/
[08:35] <xxxxxxx> ok jordan the only thing im not sure about are drivers
[08:35] <white_eagle> Boredom_inc: the original problem is, the upgrade to hardy was interrupted because some package wanted to overwrite some file which some other package had already installed (the upgrader was at 23%) so I had only the close button and the system demanded a restart from me, I rebooted and logged into recovery mode (as LjL told me to do) so he told me to do apt-get -f install and then dpkg --configure -a several bunch of times till it gets
[08:35] <ikonia> Uplink: thats not a model - I need the exact model
[08:36] <Squa7ch> how do I access the shared folders settings in Hardy Heron?
[08:36] <Uplink> ikonia, im on windows, how can i check
[08:36] <DistroJockey> Twigman, ahh *nods* You're welcome
[08:36] <nickthorley> bazhang: its ok am at work now so cant try anything on laptop - had a play getting wireless working last night and no luck
[08:36] <white_eagle> I can see I have a half hardy system and a half gutsy system
[08:36] <ikonia> Uplink: click on the network card properties
[08:36] <xxxxxxx> when i installed heron I had to click on hardware drivers to find the ati driver for the amd 780g
[08:36] <robmillion> can someone please tell me why I cannot download Ubuntu 8.04 successfully
[08:36] <robmillion> pls pm me
[08:36] <ikonia> Uplink: use device manager
[08:36] <white_eagle> i don't know the exact command, but I had 2 kernels installed
[08:36] <ikonia> robmillion: what is the error
[08:36] <white_eagle> as I could se
[08:36] <Uplink> oh ok
[08:36] <xxxxxxx> is it possible to install the driver from the command line?
[08:36] <surplusxmas> I'm attempting to install Kubuntu 8.04 (KDE4 Remix) on a 3.00GHz Pentium D, 1GB RAM, 300GB SATA with the alternative install CD.

It then allows m

[08:36] <bazhang> nickthorley: will be aroudn later if you want to try again ;]
[08:36] <xxxxxxx> can i check to find out which driver i have installed?
[08:36] <Twigman> Btw.. there is a workaround, put sata into 'raid' mode instead of ide mode.. sounds dangerous... works though!
[08:36] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: use the desktop cd, and disable X11
[08:36] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, personally, I would back up your data and do a nice clean install
[08:36] <Twigman> I'll just make sure windows still boots first though ;)
[08:37] <nickthorley> bazhang: i cant tonight - possibly tomorrow night
[08:37] <ikonia> Twigman: what is "raid mode"
[08:37] <Twigman> See yas...
[08:37] <ikonia> Twigman: if you mean fakeraid, I strongly advise agaisnt it
[08:37] <x1250> robmillion: how can we know? try another mirror
[08:37] <DistroJockey> Twigman, ahh, yeah, sorta what I was getting at with the legacy stuff
[08:37] <nickthorley> bazhang: i am wondering whether to try ndis wrapper instead
[08:37] <xxxxxxx> ikonia what about all the stuff in the desktop that I don't need?
[08:37] <Jordan_U> xxxxxxx, sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx ( if you have an ATI card )
[08:37] <Twigman> ikonia: well.. it sounds like the drives should be joined..
[08:37] <bazhang> nickthorley: well its not like we ever leave--see you then ;]
[08:37] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: what about it ?
[08:37] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: just disable it
[08:37] <Uplink> ikonia, it just tells me Broadcom 802.11 a/b/g WLAN
[08:37] <xxxxxxx> also is x11 the same as x or xorg?
[08:37] <Squa7ch> how do I access the shared folder settings in Ubuntu 8.04?  In 7.10 it was I think System>Administration>Shared Folders, was it not?
[08:37] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: yes
[08:37] <Twigman> ikonia: unfortunately there's no disabled...
[08:37] <xxxxxxx> I think xbmc linux needs an x server
[08:37] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: use the desktop cd
[08:38] <jk_> !backup
[08:38] <kelvin911> hello?
[08:38] <ubottu> There are many ways to back your system up.

[08:38] <ikonia> Twigman: where are you trying to set this
[08:38] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: no, thats not possible, I am capped I cant download the install cd from one side, and my cd-rom doesn't work from the other side
[08:38] <Twigman> This is in the bios of a dell vostro 200
[08:38] <ikonia> Twigman: contact your bios vendor then
[08:38] <xxxxxxx> then if it does won't disabling x11 prevent me from installing xbmc?
[08:38] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: so I'm stuck
[08:38] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: don't disable X then
[08:38] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, you can install without burning
[08:38] <Uplink> ikonia, in on details [service] and tells me BCM43XX

[08:38] <xukun> is there a package I need to install for the keyboard to work well? I have microsoft wireless laser keyboard 5000
[08:38] <ikonia> Uplink: ok, I'm looking
[08:39] <Twigman> ikonia:  without that setting, linux doesn't see the cdrom drive... but I'll check for a bios update, this machine just arrived today from dell so I doubt there will be an update yet..
[08:39] <nickthorley> bazhang: i found this that looks like it may be worth a try http://blog.gunbladeiv.com/
[08:39] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, checkout that last link
[08:39] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: USB install?
[08:39] <ikonia> Twigman: contact your vendor - nothing can be done to fix your bios in linux
[08:39] <xxxxxxx> I thought i would use the minimal.iso and install the dependencies and x-server
[08:39] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: in that case I would need to buy a new usb stick
[08:39] <kelvin911> i just install new ubuntu, and all the applet in awn are gone ?
[08:39] <robmillion> there is no particular error
[08:39] <white_eagle> oh
[08:39] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: from what your saying, your not going to find it easy due to your lack of experience
[08:39] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, yeah, should be able to install from an iso on a usb drive
[08:39] <Twigman> *nod* understood..... there are reports of the machine working correctly with that RAID setting though..
[08:39] <bazhang> nickthorley: will bookmark and check out in a bit; I have to head out now--hope to see you soon ;]
[08:39] <robmillion> the download finishes after 450 odd MB
[08:39] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: use the desktop cd (it's a 300 meg install-ish)

[08:39] <ubottu> I am ubottu, standing in for ubotu while he's getting his haircut done, nose powdered, updated and transitioned to his new, gorgeous looks in the near future ;)
[08:40] <nickthorley> bazhang: will be here in approx 5 hours if you want to chat but wont have laptop with me - thanks
[08:40] <DistroJockey> heyya ere4si :)
[08:40] <white_eagle> DistroJockey: but that last link focuses on windows as the preinstalled system
[08:40] <xxxxxxx> ikonia how does the desktop install cd differ from the main cd or is it the same?
[08:40] <ere4si> hey! DistroJockey
[08:40] <ikonia> white_eagle: mount the iso
[08:40] <robmillion> can anyone help?
[08:40] <white_eagle> I am ****ing stuck
[08:40] <white_eagle> :(
[08:40] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: the desk is the iso
[08:40] <ikonia> white_eagle: there is no need for bad language
[08:40] <ikonia> white_eagle: you've been here enough to know that
[08:41] <ikonia> white_eagle: "I'm stuck" would have done
[08:41] <robmillion> Linux would be great - if you didn't need a degree in computer engineering to use it.
[08:41] <white_eagle> ikonia: I'm sorry
[08:41] <frandavid100> hi guys
[08:41] <Twigman> Haha... windows will not boot with that setting, this is not looking good.. I'll just install under windows for the time being *sigh*
[08:41] <robmillion> can't even download the damn thing
[08:41] <x1250> robmillion: you don't
[08:41] <x1250> :P
[08:41] <ere4si> robmillion: are you short of hard disk space?
[08:41] <robmillion> nope
[08:41] <white_eagle> ikonia: I'm on the edge of my nerves
[08:41] <robmillion> all is fine
[08:41] <Uplink> ikonia, btw. im on HP Pavilion dv5000 series
[08:41] <x1250> robmillion: did you try another mirror?
[08:41] <ikonia> Uplink: ok, that helps
[08:41] <robmillion> yes
[08:41] <robmillion> different mirrors
[08:41] <x1250> robmillion: $ df -h ?
[08:41] <robmillion> ????
[08:41] <robmillion> I'm on windows
[08:41] <kelvin911> how come the fonts are so funny after update to hardy??
[08:41] <FloodBot1> robmillion: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:41] <ikonia> robmillion: what happens when you download ?
[08:41] <kelvin911> looks different?
[08:42] <x1250> robmillion: you have problems downloading ubuntu from windows?
[08:42] <white_eagle> !minimal
[08:42] <ubottu> The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[08:42] <frandavid100> quick question: how can I found out how to write the pound sign in a Spanish keyboard?

[08:42] <napnaop> Hi all
[08:42] <ikonia> white_eagle: what good is the minimal cd to you ?
[08:42] <robmillion> different mirrors
[08:42] <white_eagle> ikonia: for installing from usb
[08:42] <ikonia> white_eagle: you don't need that
[08:42] <white_eagle> what do I need
[08:42] <ikonia> white_eagle: did you read the links that where given to you ?
[08:43] <xxxxxxx> whiteeagle how big is your usb drive? is it flash?
[08:43] <white_eagle> I have a 512MB usb stick
[08:43] <white_eagle> yes
[08:43] <robmillion> the download seems to go fine although it only gets 450Mb of a 695Mb file
[08:43] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: Do you have any idea as to why 8.04 is running so badly?
[08:43] <white_eagle> ikonia: yes, I read the links
[08:43] <ikonia> Boredom_inc: whats running bad about it (can you give more detali)
[08:43] <white_eagle> ikonia: but that last link focuses on windows
[08:43] <DistroJockey> !install | white_eagle, try the first link

[08:44] <xxxxxxx> whiteeagle i was able to boot hardy heron from usb but i used the full distro cd
[08:44] <xxxxxxx> 1gig drive
[08:44] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: he has not read the links
[08:44] <white_eagle> I can't use a cd
[08:44] <ikonia> white_eagle: thats a CD
[08:44] <ikonia> white_eagle: so why are you looking at the minimal cd ?
[08:44] <x1250> robmillion: I downloaded from here just a moments ago, it works: http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-releases/hardy/ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso
[08:44] <DistroJockey> ikonia, I told to look at last link first (my bad)
[08:44] <white_eagle> ikonia: can't I boot the minimal cd from a flash drive?
[08:44] <ikonia> DistroJockey: not at all
[08:44] <ikonia> white_eagle: "it's a CD"

[08:45] <ferronica> at what speed should i burn ubuntu 8.04 iso image ?
[08:45] <lesshaste> I can't start X at all in hardy. I get this is .xsession-errors xmodmap:  unable to open display ':1'
[08:45] <magnetron> ferronica: 4x is usually good
[08:45] <lesshaste> http://pastebin.com/f2bc6aef7 for the whole thing
[08:46] <DistroJockey> Boredom_inc, how long has it been installed?
[08:46] <ikonia> ferronica: slow as possible
[08:46] <ferronica> magnetron: 1X
[08:46] <jk_> if i wanted to reinstall for whatever reason, can i save my settings and transfer it when the resintall was done?
[08:46] <ikonia> jk_: thats quite tricky
[08:46] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: RAM usage is 50% still ~300MiB available and I'm using the same nVidia drivers as 7.10. I have a backup of my xorg.conf from 7.10 and they are identical. I installed the RC 1 day before the official release.
[08:46] <bullgard5> What does '=m' mean in /boot/config-2.6.22-14-generic?
[08:46] <DistroJockey> Boredom_inc, I seem to recall some of my installs were slow for a little while (maybe it's indexing?)
[08:47] <ferronica> magnetron:  ikoniz: getting integrity check fail two times on max
[08:47] <x1250> jk_: settings like what, from where? /home/user ?
[08:47] <xxxxxxx> ikonia, lets say I went the mini.iso route is it possible to find out what driver I have installed now and find that exact same driver for my onboard amd 780g/ati radeon 3200?
[08:47] <ikonia> bullgard5: where ?
[08:47] <tau> hi, can someone please give me some advice on how to move the MFT out of the free space at the end of an NTFS partition?  (I tried asking this on the ##windows channel but nobody will respond :( )
[08:47] <Matic`Makovec> Hello there. I remember Gutsy Gibbon having an awesome application for handing .bin files (it practically mounted it, but it was great). Now after I upgraded to Hardy I don't have it anymore and so I'm woundering what would that kind of thing be called?
[08:47] <Uplink> ikonia, what should i do?
[08:47] <magnetron> ferronica: 2x or 4x is as slow as you would ever need to go
[08:47] <white_eagle> ikonia: hey, what about making a new partition and installing ubuntu hardy on it, then from hardy wiping this partition? will that work?
[08:47] <bullgard5> ikonia: at many places there, at least 10 different ones.
[08:47] <ikonia> xxxxxxx: it is possible, but you'll find it VERY long winded
[08:47] <ArthurArchnix> Darn. Stupid bug.
[08:47] <arooni_> i'm trying to configure my ddwrt enabled router to have give 2 mac addresses a static lease (so they'll always have the same IP address).  this is great!  but it asks me for a host name ..... i dont know what to do here.
[08:47] <ikonia> bullgard5: can you re-paste the line, I didn't see =m in any of the line you posted
[08:48] <axion> tau MFT ?
[08:48] <ikonia> white_eagle: that up to you
[08:48] <ferronica> magnetron:  but i did 1X :(
[08:48] <jk_> thinking about it i wasted my compiz settings, just found way to save that x1250
[08:48] <tau> axion: Master File Table
[08:48] <ikonia> Uplink: look in /var/log/messages to see why it couldn't load the driver
[08:48] <magnetron> ferronica: check the downloaded iso with md5
[08:48] <tarelerulz> have any of you try out the new version of Empathy that can voice with gtalk windows users ?
[08:48] <white_eagle> ikonia: i'm talking about this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromLinux
[08:48] <ikonia> arooni_: we don't support your router
[08:48] <ferronica> magnetron:  its okay
[08:48] <frandavid100> I'm trying to type the pound sign
[08:48] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: The strange thing is it ran fine the first time I booted into 8.04, maybe even marginally faster than 7.10, at least firefox was. But on each reboot things seem to be getting slower. I don't know if this is just coincidence, but something isn't right
[08:48] <kelvin911> hello why after installing hardy the arial fonts are so ugly
[08:48] <arooni_> ikonia, damn :(
[08:48] <frandavid100> <unconvertable> U+00A3 POUND SIGN
[08:48] <ikonia> white_eagle: and as I said "thats up to you"
[08:48] <ferronica> magnetron:  all matching

[08:49] <kelvin911> anyone update their ubuntu to 8.04 ?
[08:49] <tau> axion: is it, and how am I supposed to install ubuntu when I can only shrink the NTFS volume by 7MB?  yow
[08:49] <magnetron> kelvin911: yes, anyone did
[08:49] <axion> it's as asking how to move all the inode tables scattered throughout the ext2/3fs to the beginngin
[08:49] <jk_> my ubuntu has become unstable, not sure why. i open wastebin and it hangs, nautilus fails and cliking icons takes forever to launch apps
[08:49] <ferronica> magnetron:  burning right now
[08:49] <kelvin911> why the fonts are different?

[08:50] <tarelerulz> <unconvertable> kelvin911  I ugraded to Ubuntu 8.04
[08:50] <magnetron> ferronica: how long did it take to burn it at 1X? when it failed?
[08:50] <x1250> jk_: unless a new version needs to modify it
[08:50] <axion> jk_, resizentfs ?
[08:50] <tau> axion: may I ask how you installed ubuntu?
[08:50] <kelvin911> i use auto update to ungrade it

[08:52] <tarelerulz> <unconvertable> kelvin911 , a fresh is  very good sometimes.  No configure that conflik.
[08:52] <xxxxxxx> hey thanks ikonia for the advice I'm going to go tinker with it and see what I can do.
[08:52] <magnetron> ferronica: how long did it take to burn it at 1X? when it failed?
[08:53] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: It's listed in System Manager but when I hover above it is says "Idle"
[08:53] <white_eagle> ok, bye
[08:53] <white_eagle> ikonia: thanks very much
[08:53] <white_eagle> and everyone else who helped
[08:53] <ferronica> magnetron: burning it right now at 1X
[08:53] <DistroJockey> white_eagle, good luck
[08:53] <axion> tau try defragmenting the drive under windows
[08:53] <ikonia> Boredom_inc: try disabling it
[08:53] <magnetron> ferronica: you said it failed when you burned it at 1X
[08:53] <napnaop> x1250 really ? I think I've downloaded it ...
[08:53] <ikonia> Boredom_inc: I appriciate it's idle, but it can cause issues
[08:53] <tau> axion: yes, I have tried with numeroes different programs, but none of them will move the MFT!
[08:53] <ferronica> magnetron: no at max it say
[08:54] <ikonia> Boredom_inc: what video card driver does x.org say your currently using
[08:54] <tau> axion: it's very frustrating
[08:54] <axion> well g\tau do you have a recent system ?
[08:54] <AfroRowan> hey people
[08:54] <axion> tau no older then 6 years ?
[08:54] <ferronica> magnetron:accept it
[08:54] <AfroRowan> i wanna expand my memory on hda3 (my ext3 partition)
[08:54] <tau> axion: it's not actually my system, I'm helping a friend - he is running XP SP2, with a single core pentium, I think it's like 2.6Ghz or something
[08:54] <AfroRowan> when i use  gparted
[08:55] <tarelerulz> <unconvertable> tau, maybe  it is the files itself .  I would download it again and see if that might help. I would do via torrent they make sure it don't get messed up
[08:55] <AfroRowan> i cant do anything
[08:55] <magnetron> <magnetron> ferronica: 2x or 4x is as slow as you would ever need to go  <ferronica> magnetron:  but i did 1X :(
[08:55] <DistroJockey> AfroRowan, you will need to do it from a live CD
[08:55] <axion> ok tau get an external usb-drive and install it on there..
[08:55] <AfroRowan> okay
[08:55] <lesshaste> how do I move from Xgl to normal X?
[08:55] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: Closing the tracker seems to have sped things up a bit. Still not running as fast as it was when I first reboot. What does the tracker do anyway?
[08:55] <DistroJockey> AfroRowan, can't change mounted partitions
[08:55] <ferronica> magnetron: mistyped sorry
[08:56] <AfroRowan> then i know enough but one last thing, shall i lose any files ?
[08:56] <axion> tau I ran ubuntu on a 4GB usb-stick for a whole month while on vacation
[08:56] <ferronica> magnetron: accept the file that i sent you
[08:56] <DistroJockey> AfroRowan, shouldn't but a backup is very much advised
[08:56] <magnetron> ferronica: i did. it says you cancelled
[08:56] <AfroRowan> okay
[08:56] <AfroRowan> thx !
[08:56] <DistroJockey> AfroRowan, you're welcome
[08:56] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: By when I first reboot I mean when I first installed 8.04
[08:56] <tau> axion: I will run those suggestions past him, but I think he wants to use his existing drive
[08:56] <AfroRowan> ;)
[08:56] <tau> axion: thanks anyway
[08:57] <axion> tau are there more hdd's in the system ?
[08:57] <ferronica> magnetron: again i sent you
[08:57] <tau> axion: nope, well there is an external, but it is full
[08:57] <magnetron> ferronica: i accepted it
[08:57] <Boredom_inc> ikonia: xorg.conf says Identifier	"nVidia Corporation NV5M64 [RIVA TNT2 Model 64/Model 64 Pro]"... It's old but it ran in 7.10 and had no problem
[08:58] <magnetron> ferronica: use tinypic or similar
[08:58] <AfroRowan> hey im back
[08:58] <sajt> Hello!
[08:58] <axion> usb sticks have become dirt cheap and fast..
[08:58] <ferronica> magnetron: ok
[08:58] <AfroRowan> my update-manager just came up
[08:58] <AfroRowan> and it says to upgrade to 8.04 lts...
[08:58] <AfroRowan> is it safe ?
[08:58] <sajt> My sound is not working after the upgrade to hardy
[08:58] <axion> when installing on a usb stick make sure the stick is in the first port of the usb-bus.. so it is detected as the first device
[08:58] <DistroJockey> AfroRowan, that's debatable ;)
[08:59] <x1250> AfroRowan: it can be, it can be not...
[08:59] <sajt> Where can I find information about it?
[08:59] <DistroJockey> hehe
[08:59] <AfroRowan> whats debatable xD
[08:59] <ferronica> magnetron: http://i31.tinypic.com/2por71y.png
[08:59] <lesshaste> how do I move from Xgl to normal X?
[08:59] <tau> axion: okay, I don't know if he's interested in that (no money to spend) but I'll mention it
[08:59] <DistroJockey> AfroRowan, if it's working, may be better to leave it alone.
[08:59] <pepe_swash> hello. How do i make heron to recognize an ich9r raid array?
[08:59] <kelvin911> which file is the repos list?
[08:59] <AfroRowan> ok, thx again ;)
