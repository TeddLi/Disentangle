[11:12] <pbureau> Odd_Bloke, well you need to know which modules those parts of soundcard load (probably looking into dmesg or /etc/messages and then run modprobe -r drivername and if that works then you could do a permanent rmmod drivername. it should stop it from loading

Apt keeps saying that cupsys is not available but I can see it listed in the Packages.gz file. apt-get update, apt-get check or apt-get clean don't fix it.

[11:42] <whonicca> any benefits from compiling ur own kernel vs generic
[11:42] <whonicca> noticeable
[11:42] <soundray> whonicca: it's a learning experience
[11:42] <whonicca> ive done it many times on gentoo
[11:42] <quaal> whonicca, i think people only compile their kernel if some piece or hardware isnt supported in the current kernel
[11:43] <whonicca> but was just wondering if theres any noticeable performance gains

[11:43] <cchance> :'(:'(:'(:'(:'(

[11:43] <ubotu> quaal: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[11:43] <limetang> I would presume that you could get slight performance increases, whonicca
[11:44] <soundray> whonicca: you have to have at least 30% speed gain to notice it in desktop usage. You won't get that from compiling your own.
[11:44] <quaal> whonicca, yea i'm pretty sure gentoo is a text based install right
