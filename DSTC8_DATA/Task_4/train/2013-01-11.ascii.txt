[09:03] <krzkrz> sudo apt-get update returs 404 not found for that package source
[09:04] <halo4> not valid
[09:04] <defekt> osmrducks: you might have to verify the file you have already downlaoded
[09:04] <dr_willis> halo4:  lets try comthing more complex..    try 'sudo service lightdm start'
[09:04] <defekt> !md5 | osmrducks
[09:04] <ubottu> osmrducks: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows

[09:05] <ogist> i have a penguin running around on my dock

[09:06] <bentinata> dr_willis get mad, hehe
[09:07] <halo4> "sudo" is not valid command prompt
[09:07] <ogist> sudo
[09:07] <ogist> just type su then
[09:07] <dr_willis> how about outpout of this command --> 'echo $PATH'
[09:07] <halo4> me type su
[09:07] <ogist> no
[09:07] <ogist> do what he says, im just a noob
[09:07] <krzkrz> dr_willis, what irc clien are you using?
[09:07] <defekt> echo $SHELL
[09:08] <dr_willis> krzkrz:  andchat, going via ZNC into my home raspberry pi.
[09:08] <ogist> i haven't linuxed as long as the rest

[09:09] <ogist> i coulda ran windows xp forever
[09:09] <mystblade9> Hi. I have here a USB stick that is acting rather strangely. I altered it with unetbootin, and would now like to undo it. XFCE automounts the drive, but it doesn't show up in /dev als /dev/sdc1, only as /dev/sdc. If I run fdisk on it, it says "this doesn't look like a partition table", and gparted doesn't even detect it. How do I restore my USB stick to pure fat32?
[09:09] <halo4> i think i have 16 gigabites of ram
[09:09] <ogist> that is very good halo4
[09:09] <halo4> prossessor
[09:09] <ogist> why dont ya just reinstall ubuntu
[09:09] <ogist> :)
[09:10] <osmrducks> defekt: it says check sums r diff... so what do i do?
[09:10] <halo4> 16 gigabite prossessor is good
[09:10] <bentinata> It's feel good when you repair, without reinstall
[09:10] <defekt> mystblade9: your USB is blank with no partions you need to format it.
[09:10] <dr_willis> halo4:   you typed without quotes the command        echo $SHELL    and  echo $PATH and it said invalid command?
[09:10] <dr_willis> both times
[09:10] <halo4> yes sir
[09:11] <TakeItEZ> halo4: type "help", what is the first line you get
[09:11] <halo4> yes it dose nothing i cant login to the thing
[09:11] <defekt> osmrducks: redowload ubuntu, the version you have is currupted
[09:11] <dr_willis> halo4:  you ARE logged in
[09:11] <halo4> but..
[09:11] <mystblade9> defekt: Yes, but how? There's no /dev/sdc1, and this is the output fdisk gives me: http://pastie.org/private/j9z3lhspvnvsbdhzjutjbq
[09:11] <dr_willis> but what.. you keepo confuseing the issue
[09:11] <krzkrz> how do i remove this repo: http://ppa.launchpad.net/paullo612/unityshell-rotated/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources
[09:11] <bentinata> dr_willis become more mad, hehe
[09:11] <halo4> im not at the same time
[09:11] <halo4> confused :/
[09:12] <dr_willis> we said earlier you are logged into the shell
[09:12] <halo4> what is the shell mean
[09:12] <dr_willis> now either you are totally messing up every command. or you got a very very badly broken system
[09:12] <ogist> cat /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:12] <ogist> ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list
[09:12] <halo4> so i have a virus
[09:13] <dr_willis> halo4:  no onme has mentioned a virus
[09:13] <dr_willis> and last i looked.. there are no linux  viruses out in the wild.
[09:13] <bentinata> Is virus is really exist on Linux?
[09:13] <ogist> krzkrz: try this first sudo cp -p /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list_backup
[09:13] <halo4> i think it maebe a virus on my pc
[09:13] <mrosmrducks> defekt: the check sums r diff... ne suggestions?
[09:13] <eutheria> can you still get the alternative install cd for 12.10?
[09:13] <ogist> linux is like a mac
[09:13] <dr_willis> halo4:  if you think so.. safest thing is to reinstall..
[09:14] <defekt> mystblade9: sorry can't check pastbin atm. did you try 'sudo cfdisk /dev/sdc'
[09:14] <TakeItEZ> eutheria: no, they stopped the alternate-cd, use mini.iso or desktop
[09:14] <halo4> i dont know anything about that kind of thing
[09:14] <dr_willis> i  am very confident you dont have a virus on a linux install
[09:14] <defekt> mrosmrducks: redowload ubuntu, the version you have is currupted
[09:14] <ogist> hey
[09:14] <eutheria> TakeItEZ, can you still create an encrypted partition using ?mini?
[09:14] <ogist> krzkrz
[09:15] <krzkrz> ogist, i dont see  http://ppa.launchpad.net/paullo612/unityshell-rotated/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources anywhere
[09:15] <TakeItEZ> eutheria: i don't know
[09:15] <ogist> krzkrz: do this ->   gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:15] <ogist> delete the line of code that has it
[09:15] <mrosmrducks> ok will try
[09:15] <ogist> and then type sudo apt-get update
[09:15] <mystblade9> defekt:  FATAL ERROR: Bad primary partition 1: Partition begins after end-of-disk
[09:17] <WanderingEnder> Anyone know which is less taxing on system resources? lubuntu or xubuntu. Thinking of deploying either on a 1 core 2 GB Azure VM.
[09:17] <ogist> WanderingEnder, lubuntu is
[09:17] <WanderingEnder> ty
[09:17] <ogist> but you can probably rub ubuntu on it
[09:17] <defekt> mystblade9: are you getting any dmesg errors when you plug the stick in?
[09:17] <ogist> and switch to fxce
[09:18] <chamunks> I have domainA.com domainB.com and domainC.com and they are all being routed through cloudflare at my ULAMP and I am reading mention of needing to edit the hosts file from this apache documentation http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/examples.html
[09:18] <ogist> you can run ubuntu and switch out unity with XFCE runs much faster and its interface stays out of your way allowing you more screen real estate for activities like programming and browsing.
[09:18] <chamunks> How would I accomplish this hosts file edit.
[09:18] <chamunks> ./etc/hosts yes?
[09:18] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: /etc/hosts, no leading .
[09:18] <chamunks> but is there some kind of syntax that I need to use to point things in different direction
=== Mitos-Daniel is now known as Rullish
[09:19] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, yes i just added the leading . so irc didnt catch it as a cmd
[09:19] <dr_willis> chamunks:  full paths dont start with a ./ that woul d be a relative path ;)
[09:19] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: use a space, its not misleading
[09:19] <blue112> Hello here.
[09:19] <dr_willis>           // i just put spaces here
[09:19] <tsimpson> chamunks: you don't need to edit /etc/hosts for apache, only if you want to test locally without DNS
[09:19] <eutheria> TakeItEZ, sorry i am being stupid, where do you get mini .iso from?
[09:20] <TakeItEZ> !mini | eutheria
[09:20] <ubottu> eutheria: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[09:20] <chamunks> well anyways the leading . aside :P
[09:20] <blue112> Since last reboot, gnome-shell won't launch anymore, it segfault just after login. What can I do to fix that ? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 x64.
[09:20] <bentinata> Hello blue112
[09:20] <eutheria> thank you TakeItEZ :)
[09:20] <mystblade9> defekt: Nevermind, found a solution. Am now overwriting the drive with zeros.
[09:20] <halo4> can anyone help me with my shell
[09:20] <bentinata> halo4, reinstall
[09:20] <chamunks> tsimpson, thanks that makes sense well I dont really see any specific benefits of testing locally really afaik
[09:20] <Kartagis> in cairo-dock, I've accidentally moved pidgin into firefox dock. how can I undo that?
[09:20] <secretbutter> halo4 no its broken
[09:21] <eutheria> next question, so deja-dup created me a very broken backup
[09:21] <eutheria> i want something that isn't going to create me a broken backup
[09:21] <dr_willis> halo4:  does       cd /bin/                seem to work or does it give an error?
[09:21] <halo4> if i reinstal i might lose my data
[09:21] <TakeItEZ> eutheria: rsnapshot is one tool
[09:21] <dr_willis> halo4:  you can use a live cd to access the data and back stuff up
[09:21] <bentinata> you can backup using console
[09:21] <hexstatik> is it easy to install ubuntu on mac book pro(intel i7)?
[09:22] <eutheria> TakeItEZ, command line?
[09:22] <blue112> Anyone ?
=== qos is now known as qos|away
=== carlos is now known as Guest48950
[09:22] <secretbutter> halo4 no you cant, its lost. forever
[09:22] <hexstatik> are there all the drivers available or any other issues?
[09:22] <TakeItEZ> eutheria: sure
[09:22] <bentinata> dr_willis suggestion is the easiest way
[09:22] <halo4> all my musics
[09:22] <dr_willis> halo4:  does       cd /bin/                seem to work or does it give an error?
[09:22] <chamunks> tsimpson, what would a line for the hosts file look like for domainA.com anyways?
[09:22] <eutheria> i was really after something like deja-dup
[09:22] <krzkrz> ogist, its not there repo: http://ppa.launchpad.net/paullo612/unityshell-rotated/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources
=== qos|away is now known as qos
[09:22] <bentinata> eutheria, u1
[09:22] <eutheria> maybe something that can do a network backup
[09:23] <eutheria> u1?
[09:23] <bentinata> ubuntu one
[09:23] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: 127.0.1.1 domaina.com
[09:23] <chamunks> ok fair enough thanks TakeItEZ
[09:23] <eutheria> sadly i can't use ubuntu one,
[09:23] <halo4> it still says not valid command or oporateve file
[09:23] <tsimpson> chamunks: you'd just add domainA.com to the end of the existing line starting with 127.0.0.1, eg: "127.0.0.1 localhost domainA.com domainB.com domainC.com"
[09:24] <dr_willis> halo4:  so the command 'cd' even fails?        just cd, no quotes or anything special
[09:24] <bentinata> halo4, did you have camera?
[09:24] <blue112> Anyone knows how can I start a terminal to try debug my problem with gnome-shell crashed ?
[09:24] <eutheria> maybe i can if i could put an encrypted blob
[09:24] <chamunks> tsimpson, its wierd because the hosts file generated has a separate line for localhost and the machine name
[09:24] <halo4> what is batch
[09:24] <bentinata> halo4, take a picture of your monitor, and give it here
[09:24] <chamunks> http://puu.sh/1MlR0
[09:24] <chamunks> tsimpson, ^
[09:25] <secretbutter> halo4 you are screwed lol
[09:25] <halo4> i havent got a camera handy
[09:25] <bentinata> secretbutter, it's not funny
[09:26] <bentinata> halo4, "help"
[09:26] <tsimpson> chamunks: you can give different domains different loopback IPs in the 127.0.0.0/8 range, so they can seem to have unique IPs
[09:26] <halo4> i need help
[09:26] <bentinata> halo4, try "help"
[09:26] <halo4> type it
[09:26] <bentinata> halo4, yes
[09:26] <dr_willis> cd is a bash  and sh built in command i thought.. if its failing hes got some deep issues
[09:27] <chamunks> tsimpson, I didnt notice there was a difference heh sorry well thats good and interesting then I can take the different IP's and then route those in the apache section of this task.
[09:27] <halo4> is not valid
[09:27] <bentinata> very deep, dude
[09:27] <chamunks> tsimpson, if im having trouble with routing i suppose :S
[09:27] <blue112> Since last reboot, gnome-shell won't launch anymore, it segfault just after login. What can I do to fix that ? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 x64.
[09:27] <defekt> no busybox o.O
[09:27] <halo4> help is not a valid command or oporatevable batch file
[09:27] <bentinata> halo4, try restarting, it usually works :)
[09:28] <halo4> i did re start my pc
[09:28] <tsimpson> "not a valid command or batch file" seems very much like the error you get from cmd.exe on windows
[09:28] <halo4> i cant login, and by log in i mean use it after i log in
[09:28] <dr_willis> halo4:  so what does your prompt look like exactly?     yoruusername@yourcomputername:       ?
[09:28] <halo4> no not exactly
[09:29] <halo4> but kinda prompt
[09:29] <vtghii> hi, Gnome shell is cp hog with FGLRX installed, how to fix this problem, I have an ati card, enough ram and processor, it's only with fglrx that GS use 50%cpu
[09:29] <dr_willis> halo4:  so what does your prompt look like exactly?

[09:30] <tsimpson> odyssey4me: you file a bug on launchpad requesting the backport
[09:30] <krzkrz> i get http://pastie.org/5666815 every time i do sudo apt-get update
[09:30] <dr_willis> halo4:  does  'dir' give any output?
[09:31] <halo4> hey its valid one
[09:31] <odyssey4me> thx tsimpson
[09:31] <bentinata> blue112, what did show to your screen?
[09:31] <dr_willis> and  the output  is?
[09:31] <halo4> its a lot of stuff
[09:31] <halo4> all my files
[09:31] <vtghii> I have installed fglrx drivers via jockey succesfully, then gnome shell is cpu hog, like 50%, the more I use it the more it's cpu hog, don'kt know what to do with the link :(
[09:31] <blue112> bentinata, IRC shows (XChat), because I launch it at startup
[09:32] <bentinata> dr_willis, halo4 is kicked to grub-shell
[09:32] <blue112> bentinata, it has no window decoration. Nothing else shows.
[09:32] <blue112> Oh, yeah, apport shows two few reboot before, said gnome-shell segfaults.
[09:32] <dr_willis> bentinata:  he said he was at LOGIN: earlier.. and that dosent look like a grub prompt to me
[09:32] <krzkrz> anyone?
[09:33] <bentinata> dr_willis, halo4 is forced to grub-shell
[09:33] <dr_willis> bentinata:  im thinking hes at the windows shell ;)
[09:33] <blue112> krzkrz, you got a ppa which is either not compatible with your distribution, or either dead. You should remove it.
[09:33] <halo4> it says contacts desktop documents downloas musics roms potos porn scriipts searches videos
[09:33] <krzkrz> blue112, how do i remove it
[09:33] <blue112> krzkrz, you can find its file at /etc/apt/source.list.d/
[09:33] <blue112> You just have to remove it.
[09:34] <TakeItEZ> i smell a troll
[09:34]  * dr_willis is about ready to clock out from work also.
[09:34] <vtghii> what is the version of fglrx on ubuntu 12.04?
[09:34] <halo4> so my files are not gone
[09:34] <krzkrz> blue112, then just do an rm?
[09:35] <halo4> i just cant log in
[09:35] <blue112> krzkrz, yep, just rm the problematic file in that folder, and apt shouldn't make any noise anymore.
[09:35] <bentinata> blue112, can you open terminal?
[09:35] <blue112> bentinata, I don't think so. I can go to tty1, but I can't have a virtual terminal.
[09:35] <blue112> I can open firefox with clicking a link on this channel :p
[09:36] <poq> Is any software to change memory values for ubuntu such ArtMoney and CheatEngine under win?
[09:36] <krzkrz> thanks blue112
[09:36] <halo4> so i keep my files with re install
[09:36] <halo4> live dise
[09:36] <MoL0ToV> exist a possible to configure ubuntu to automagically place in /media all the smb shares of the local net? as usb sticks and cdrom...
[09:36] <bentinata> halo4, live disc first, then reinstall
[09:37] <blue112> poq, you can access memory at /dev/memory. There's a high probability you crash everything if you don't know what you're doing, though.
[09:37] <halo4> how long should it take
[09:37] <bentinata> blue112, how can you open firefox with xchat? cool!

[09:37] <dr_willis> halo4:  how do we know how many files you have...
[09:37] <blue112> bentinata, yeah but it won't handle focus anymore, so I have to close firefox to go back to xchat :/
[09:38] <halo4> its mostly music
[09:38] <kepler> blue112, you can try to alt+click and move windows around
[09:38] <dr_willis> halo4:  it takes as long as it takes... we dont know how many GB of files you have..
[09:38] <halo4> i have a 16 gb prossesor
[09:38] <bentinata> blue112, "gnome-shell replace"
[09:39] <TakeItEZ> you don't halo4
[09:39] <blue112> kepler, it doesn't work. I can move window by handling then at the menu bar. But focus isn't working, I won't be able to speak here if firefox is open
[09:39] <halo4> it says so in the sticer
[09:39]  * dr_willis has a 8core toaster oven

[09:44] <blue112> radium, sure, you can use google dns by going into the NetworkManager, and replace the DNS line with 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
[09:44] <dr_willis> radium:  a great many people use both
[09:44] <ph1rmw4r3> okay
[09:44] <m3pow> is there any reason why disk access in Ubuntu 12.10 is that slow. I am running it on an HDX 18
[09:44] <vtghii> kepler, I did it, I have amd conotrol center open
[09:44] <radium> dr_willis: both at same time? rite?
[09:44] <m3pow> i've used 12.04 before and there things seemed to be OK. everything was fast
[09:44] <ph1rmw4r3> well im going to go to bed while i reinstall ubuntu
[09:44] <ph1rmw4r3> ill talk to you later dr willis
[09:44] <dr_willis> radium:  you could if you wanted  i guess
[09:44] <blue112> Since last reboot, gnome-shell won't launch anymore, it segfault just after login. What can I do to fix that ? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 x64.
[09:44] <kepler> if you pop on information, does it populate correctly?
[09:45] <dr_willis> i dont see much point in using opendns if you are using googles
[09:45] <radium> Blue112: thanks, but i know that  , my main ques is that . is it really fast to use open dns?
[09:45] <vedarthk> I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 on Lenevo U410 which has Nvidia Graphics card, how do I install nvidia drivers ?
[09:45] <m3pow> it is pretty annoying to have a slow experience in Ubuntu
[09:45] <ogist> I like this linux
[09:45] <ph1rmw4r3> goodnight dr_willis
[09:46] <ogist> it is like a macbook
[09:46] <blue112> radium, what is slow exactly ? Is your DNS resolution is slow ?
[09:46] <radium> and one more ques.. how to scroll up .. bcoz there is no scroll bar.. i'm using xchat
[09:46] <radium> blue112: yeah .. very slow
[09:46] <ogist> page up
[09:46] <blue112> radium, then yes, it should speed things up.
[09:46] <radium> local isp isn't really that fast as i thought
[09:46] <ogist> open dns?
[09:46] <radium> ogist thanks :)
[09:46] <blue112> radium, you can try other dns resolution speed by using host command
[09:47] <blue112> host host_to_resolve dns_to_use
[09:47] <radium> blue112: lemme try this .  btw  thanks :)
[09:47] <blue112> No problem.
[09:48] <blue112> Any clue about my gnome-shell bug ?
[09:48] <blue112> [or any channel I can ask for help ?]
[09:48] <radium> blue112?  what kinda bug?
[09:48] <blue112> Since last reboot, gnome-shell won't launch anymore, it segfault just after login.
[09:49] <radium> did u check ur bash profile?
[09:49] <blue112> what about it ?
[09:49] <MonkWitDaFunk> blue112. does your bug make your system.freeze shirtly after booting?
[09:50] <blue112> MonkWitDaFunk, nop, it's not freezing, I'm currently using it. XChat autostarts after startup. It's just I have no window decorator and no gnome-shell top-bar.
[09:50] <radium> for any bad alias? or it maybe corrupted ..any bad configuration
[09:51] <vedarthk> hi, I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 on Lenevo U410 which has Nvidia Graphics card, how do I install nvidia drivers ?
[09:51] <blue112> radium, hm, I haven't changed anything in it since last reboot, unfortunately.
[09:51] <blue112> vedarthk, you can download them on the NVidia website, directly.
[09:51] <dr_willis> vedarthk:  package name is  nvidia-current in the repos
[09:51] <blue112> Or use the repository, yes.
[09:51] <dr_willis> vedarthk:  dont use the ones from the nvidia site if you can avoid it
[09:51] <radium> blue112: no clue sir
[09:51] <blue112> mkay
[09:52] <vedarthk> dr_willis thank you
[09:52] <vedarthk> blue112 thank you
[09:52] <blue112> _
[09:53] <MonkWitDaFunk> with vedarthk's issue, would doing a clean install get his/her drivers?
[09:53] <blue112> !nvidia | blue112
[09:53] <ubottu> blue112, please see my private message
[09:53] <svneo> hi, i'm getting WARNING: gnome-keyring:: couldn't connect to: /home/user/.cache/keyring-GT4vfX/pkcs11: Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce type  every time i "svn up"; how can i solve that?
[09:53] <dr_willis> dident even see them sttate an issue, just asked how to install the nvida drivers
[09:54] <MonkWitDaFunk> righy
[09:54] <dr_willis> svneo:  its just a warning.. are you saying the command is failing?
[09:54] <MonkWitDaFunk> right*
[09:55] <MonkWitDaFunk> eit
[09:55] <svneo> dr_willis: no it's working fine
[09:55] <svneo> dr_willis: but if possible i'd like to avoid the warning
[09:55] <MonkWitDaFunk> sorry about my text ppl
[09:56] <radium> could someone please tell me where to find host file? in ubuntu 12.04?
[09:56] <TakeItEZ> radium:  /etc/hosts
[09:56] <NuSuey> is there a way to be notified when the new ati drivers are out? no rss/newsletter?articles somewhere?
[09:56] <radium> TakeItEZ : thank you :)
[09:56] <chamunks> Ive got an error restarting apache http://puu.sh/1MmaW make_sock:could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80 which strikes me as an odd thing to say
[09:57] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: sudo lsof -i :80                  anything listening/blocking the port?
[09:57] <chamunks> apparently i needed to remember to sudo but now im getting could not
[09:57] <JornStian> http://lino.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/quantal/universe/base/xserver-xorg-video-displaylink <--- Latest version:	*DELETED*
[09:57] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, I fudged a silly and didnt sudo
[09:58] <JornStian> how can I figure out why the package have been dropped?
[09:58] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, http://puu.sh/1MmbN this is the echo
[10:00] <TomyLaptop> can "kdesudo -u otheruser /home/otheruser/one_of_his_programs" harm me?
[10:02] <Grievre> Hey um... so the ubuntu article on creating bootable USB sticks doesn't tell you how to do it from non-ubuntu distributions
[10:02] <Grievre> only ubuntu, windows and mac os
[10:04] <extropy> so I moved a boot disk from one computer to another, didn't work, moved it back to original, now it won't boot
[10:04] <dr_willis> hmm,, seems displaylink monitors (and the company)  have a bit of a history with  poor linux support
[10:05] <extropy> any particular reason why ubuntu installation CDs don't have some sort of "repair boot manager" option?
[10:05] <dr_willis> Grievre:  the pendrivelinux site should have tools for several disrtos... or you can 'dd' the iso file to the  usb from most any linux disrto
[10:05] <Grievre> dr_willis: Okay, does that work?
[10:05] <extropy> serious, what's with all this fancy schmancy "EUFI" crap? seems to be just getting in my way. What can't I just set a damn boot flag and be done with it?
[10:06] <dr_willis> extropy:  there is a boot-repair livce cd you can get.  its 32 and 64bit compatiable
[10:06] <dr_willis> Grievre:  dd? should work its the simpleist way
[10:06] <extropy> dr_willis I shouldn't be needing to repair anything to begin with.
[10:06] <TakeItEZ> Grievre: cat/dd works, if the iso is an hybrid-iso (as most actual linux-iso are)
[10:06] <JornStian> dr_willis: does that mean that canonical dropped the package because it was unstable?
[10:06] <dr_willis> extropy:  you asked a question. i answered... so whatever
[10:06] <Grievre> okay but are the ubuntu ISOs like that
[10:06] <extropy> I never did anything (intentionally) to invalidate my SSD's boot-worthiness
[10:07] <dr_willis> JornStian:  from what im reading at askubuntu.com theres a bit of a  history of poor support.
[10:07] <extropy> dr_willis: why should I need an entire LiveCD just to set a damn boot flag? who the hell decided Ubuntu should be so freaking complicated?
[10:07] <dr_willis> JornStian:  and i was wanting to get one of those things
[10:07] <dr_willis> extropy:   this is a support channel. not a ranting channel.
[10:08] <TakeItEZ> Grievre: they are
[10:08] <Grievre> extropy: What do you mean "why should I need an entire livecd just to set a boot flag", you need an OS to boot into before you can do anything
[10:08] <dr_willis> Grievre:  the ability to dd the iso  straight to flash  has only worked with the latest 2-3 releases of ubuntu i belive.
[10:08] <extropy> Grievre: Ubuntu's default livecd should be sufficient. I'm not suggesting, I'm insisting.
[10:08] <bentinata> anyone?
[10:09] <JornStian> dr_willis: well... for now you can hold that purchase.. it's not close to working :|
[10:09] <bentinata> someone notice me?
[10:09] <dr_willis> JornStian:  yep. was wanting one for my RaspberryPi
[10:09] <Grievre> extropy: oh you can't do it with the default livecd? I would have thought you should be able to
[10:09] <extropy> Grievre: seems like a no-brainer to me, just sayin'
[10:10] <Grievre> I'm unfamiliar with UEFI, what's the issue here?
[10:10] <TakeItEZ> extropy: why shouldn't you be able to set a boot-flag on a partition with the standard-live-cd?
[10:10] <dr_willis> You can install boot-repair with the live cd. (to ram)
[10:10] <dr_willis> you can set flags with cfdisk or parted i imagine
[10:10] <extropy> TakeItEZ: that is a great, questions: something something ext4
[10:10] <qwiksilver711_> anyone here familiar with getting 12.04 functional on an alienware m14x?
[10:11] <TakeItEZ> extropy: "man parted"
[10:11] <extropy> dr_willis: that would be the advice I'm looking for
[10:11] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, do you think I can define two ServerName's in sites-available/siteA like ServerName siteA.com then Servername www.siteA.com
[10:11] <chamunks> would that work?
[10:11] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: idk, i don't deal with apache
[10:11] <MonkeyDust> !anyone | qwiksilver711_
[10:11] <ubottu> qwiksilver711_: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[10:12] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, fair enough
[10:12] <Grievre> extropy: what error are you getting when you try to boot?
[10:12] <extropy> TakeItEZ: parted has nothing to do with it ... otherwise I wouldn't be her. if is was just a matter of setting a boot flag I'd be done
[10:12] <extropy> "Reboot and Select propert Boot device"
[10:13] <extropy> EFI, ext4 and swap partitions all seem to be in good shape, no idea why it won't freaking boot
[10:13] <TakeItEZ> extropy: 11:07 < extropy> dr_willis: why should I need an entire LiveCD just to set a damn boot flag?  so what do you really want to do? please give info and stop your pointless rants
[10:13] <Grievre> dr_willis: should I dd onto the drive or onto a partition on the drive?
[10:13] <dr_willis> Grievre:  the drive  always the drive
[10:13] <Grievre> extropy: is your BIOS configured right?
[10:13] <extropy> TakaItEZ: I'm over simplifying there. I *should* just be able to set a boot flag, problem solved. The fact is I can't.
[10:13] <dr_willis> Grievre:  and DONT get the wrong drive. ;)(
[10:14] <gsommer> I've created a patch for a dep package (paps) - I wouln't mind giving it back to the community (either as .patch, or as dep package)... I just can't figure out who to contact - and how to do this? :/
[10:15] <agsel> I disable some shortcuts from keyboard settings, but they still work
[10:15] <extropy> how about someone just brief me on what Ubuntu is doing these days for their bootmanager. I can tell somethings new.
[10:15] <guest16> IIRC the UEFI system partition (the boot partition) must be a FAT
[10:15] <guest16> not ext...
[10:16] <extropy> when did Ubuntu move to this UEFI thing? its somehow convinced itself that my JumpDrive is a bootable partition and nothing else
[10:17] <MonkeyDust> extropy  it didnt, it was forced to follow
[10:17] <dr_willis> computers are moveing to using UEFI
[10:17] <dr_willis> if i have a flash drive set up correctly ive noticed the bios shows it as a uefi disk
[10:17] <dr_willis> some times it shows it as both a uefi disk and a non uefi disk
[10:17] <dr_willis> and i could boot it either way
[10:18] <MonkeyDust> extropy  UEFI replaces BIOS, it has nothing to do with Ubuntu
[10:18] <extropy> dr_willis: mine seems to have taken over, asserting that it's USB Flash drive is my *only* boot partition.
[10:19] <extropy> guess I don't see how any of this stuff is necessary
[10:19] <chamunks> Do i need to run a2ensite every time I edit files in /etc/apache2/sites-available/?
[10:20] <extropy> Extensible Firmware: as in ... the world's slickest hardware backdoor?
[10:21] <dr_willis> its what exists.. so it really dosent matter
[10:21] <qwiksilver711_> does the iso download set up the dual boot loader on its own?
=== john__ is now known as __j0hn__
[10:21] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  what iso download?
[10:21] <extropy> why do I get the feeling like I have to boot from my disk to get my computer to boot from my disk?
[10:21] <qwiksilver711_> just the 12.04 one
[10:21] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  a normal install should set up grub to dual boot a  system
[10:21] <qwiksilver711_> i was going to install it in the morning
[10:22] <qwiksilver711_> as long as its not going to trash things
[10:22] <qwiksilver711_> i tried with 10.4 and it was rough for me
[10:22] <extropy> "oh hey, we *can* boot from your SSD ... we'll just do that by default from now on, sorry for the inconvenience. Any idea how it got like this to begin with?"
[10:22] <dijit> Hallo
[10:23] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis thank you for the answer
[10:23] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  make backups
[10:23] <dr_willis> always have backups
[10:24] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis: of course, already have the drive imaged to my nas
[10:24] <extropy> incidentally I have no use for a "boot repair" livecd seeing as how I don't have a cdrom, or any flash drives available not that I'm even going to bother assuming thats an option ...
[10:24] <dijit> Ok, I've googled extensively
[10:24] <extropy> this should really be a one-line thing I can do from Ubuntu's live cd "sudo fixmydisk" ...
[10:25] <dijit> so I'm hoping someone by chance sees this.
[10:25] <TakeItEZ> extropy: try switching your computer to bios-boot and stop your pointless rants here
[10:25] <dijit> I have a server (Ubuntu 10.04 LTS)
[10:25] <dijit> which will not boot.
[10:25] <dijit> it drops to busy box with the line "could not find /dev/mapper/<servername>-root
[10:26] <dijit> however, not only does the block device exist, it's mountable
[10:26] <dr_willis> dijit:  you ae using lvm? or raid?
[10:26] <dijit> both.
[10:26] <dijit> raid1 (hardware)
[10:26] <dijit> and lvm.
[10:26] <svneo> hi, i'm getting WARNING: gnome-keyring:: couldn't connect to: /home/user/.cache/keyring-GT4vfX/pkcs11: No such file or directory  every time i "svn up"; how can i solve this warning?
[10:27] <extropy> TakeItEZ: care to elaborate or should I just continue ranting instead?
[10:27] <TakeItEZ> extropy: what part you don't understand?
[10:28] <extropy> the entire part
[10:28] <extropy> starting when you wrote something
[10:28] <extropy> set my computer to bios-boot ... is that supposed to mean something to me at all?
[10:28] <qwiksilver711_> extropy: I think TakeItEZ meant to suggest you set the boot option in the bios to the HDD
[10:28] <qwiksilver711_> or SDD
[10:28] <qwiksilver711_> SSD* sorry
[10:29] <extropy> qwiksilver711_ thanks, it's amazing what a little clarity can achieve.
[10:29] <dijit> dr_willis; I assumed it was taking too long to pvscan so I set rootdelay=60
[10:29] <qwiksilver711_> extropy no problem
[10:29] <dijit> which also does not work.
[10:29] <dr_willis> dijit:  i never use raid or lvm. so ive got no real suggestions
[10:29] <dijit> balls. cheers anyway.
[10:30] <MonkeyDust> dijit  try in #ubuntu-server
[10:30] <ogist> ubuntu server
[10:30] <ogist> heh
[10:31] <Grievre> I don't know why the word "webinar" makes me so irrationally angry
[10:32] <qwiksilver711_> are the new versions of ubuntu more friendly with laptops running nvidia optimus?
[10:32] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  its still a work in progress
[10:32] <kepler> qwiksilver711_, nothing linux is friendly with optimus (yet)
[10:32] <extropy> I see bios_grub in Gparted, is that what I want?
[10:32] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis the thing that turned me off when i used 10.04 was that i couldnt force the nvidia off
[10:32] <qwiksilver711_> extropy no
[10:32] <extropy> no "bios-boot", should I be using something else?
[10:32] <MonkeyDust> qwiksilver711_  nvidia is to blame for that
[10:33] <qwiksilver711_> extropy its like the actual bios options
[10:33] <qwiksilver711_> extropy nothing to do with gparted, its the screeen that comes up withen you first boot, and you hit like f2 to get into it
[10:33] <qwiksilver711_> extrop should have an option there to change the boot priority list
[10:34] <qwiksilver711_> so, even if ubuntu forces both my graphics cards to run i'm still going to do it this time
[10:34] <qwiksilver711_> if i have a 13 button mouse is it possible to use something to map those buttons to something?
[10:34] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  should be possible
[10:35] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  ive seen some well done arch linux wiki pages for some specific mice
[10:35] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis i poked around for that a bit tonight, but was unable to find anything for my mouse, its not a super common make
[10:35] <extropy> call me crazy but I think this EUFI thing is just a slippery slope to hardware backdoors and Chernobyl-virus like hardware bricking down the road /rant
[10:36] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  the gernal guides may show what commands/tools they use
[10:36] <jpds> extropy: Have you been to Chernobyl?
[10:36] <extropy> no but I've had doesn't of systems wiped by WinCH
[10:36] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis i read something about something called xorg?
[10:36] <extropy> *dozens
[10:36] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  thats  the X server.
[10:36] <arkonten> can any one explain why Ubuntu Software Center's search can't find the samtools package when I search for 'samtools'? I can find it in aptitude and the various cmd line apt tools without issue
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[10:37] <extropy> Ubuntu Software Center != debians own repos, I believe ...
[10:37] <dr_willis> arkonten:  theres some 'advanced/command line/other' filters at the bottom i recall
[10:37] <MonkeyDust> extropy  maybe you should read some background information about UEFI, what it is, why it's there etc
[10:37] <dr_willis> i never use software center
[10:37] <JornStian> extropy: I for one, welcome UEFI.. getting rid of legacy AT-support and whatnot will bring us forward loads
[10:37] <dr_willis> MonkeyDust:  dont confuse things with facts!
[10:38] <extropy> MonkeyDust maybe I'm already doing that and it doesn't seem all that necessary
[10:38] <arkonten> dr_willis: I've seen that for other queries, but I get nothing for samtools.
[10:39] <qwiksilver711_> is it better to run 32 or 64 bit?
[10:40] <MonkeyDust> qwiksilver711_  64bit on 64bit hardware
[10:40] <dr_willis> i use 64bit os on allmy 64bit hardware
[10:40] <TakeItEZ> qwiksilver711_: if your cpu supports 64bit, there is no reason to use 32bit
[10:40] <qwiksilver711_> i thought so, my cpu will support it
[10:41] <extropy> for being so fancy, new and allegedly useful, it sure seems to be doing nothing for me besides get in my way
[10:41] <dr_willis> take it to #ubuntu-offtioic
[10:41] <qwiksilver711_> minecraft works with 12.04 right?
[10:41] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  ive heard it does
[10:42] <qwiksilver711_> hooray
[10:42] <extropy> on EUFI: " It does not solve any of the BIOS's long-standing problems of requiring two different driversone for the firmware and one for the operating systemfor most hardware."
[10:42] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  i think it needs the oracle java
[10:42] <dr_willis> extropy:  enough allready.. we dont care
[10:42] <TomyLaptop> can "kdesudo -u otheruser /home/otheruser/one_of_his_programs" harm me?
[10:42] <extropy> dr_willis: clearly, you don't. which is why I'll stop ranting when I feel like it.
[10:42] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis thats fine, if it will run on something i'll figure out how to make it work
[10:43] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:  worse case it could affect your users home files yes.
[10:43] <MonkeyDust> extropy  no rants here, please
[10:43] <TomyLaptop> dr_willis, damn. can i prevent this?
[10:43] <extropy>  EFI [is] an attempt to remove the ability of the user to truly control the computer.
[10:44] <Tager> extropy: how so?
[10:44] <Grievre> extropy: It's primarily an attempt to replace the extremely outdated PC boot sequence with something more modern. Some people see it as what you describe, though
[10:44] <MonkeyDust> extropy  richard stallman uses his own custom BIOS, maybe you should contact him
[10:44] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:    that would be the worse case. if you are worried about it. log out and back in as the user in question. ive never really tried any exploits. so im not sure how su could come 'back' to your home. bu
[10:44] <TakeItEZ> !ot
[10:44] <ubottu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[10:44] <extropy> MonkeyDust: I'll contact Theo DeRaadt first
[10:45] <TomyLaptop> dr_willis, how about kdesudo su otheruser -c ...
[10:45] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:  ive never heard of suing to a user being an issue. but   the user does have some rights to your X display and other stuff so its not totally isolated
[10:45] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:  that may just add more confusion and loopholes..
[10:45] <Grievre> Why is the default block size for dd so small
[10:45] <Grievre> like laughably small, to the point where it bottlenecks the transfer
[10:45] <dr_willis> Grievre:  because the source code is so old. ;)
[10:45] <TakeItEZ> Grievre: historical reasons i guess
[10:46] <dr_willis> Grievre:  ive heard some disrtos have dds block size bigger but never noticed

[10:47] <dijit> :(
[10:47] <k3lt> just installed Ubuntu 12.04 and i wanna stay on it, how can I filter out the 12.10 Ubuntu update ?
[10:47] <k3lt> on the ubuntu software update center
[10:48] <dr_willis> k3lt:  the lts version shouldent be asking to upgrade to non-lts unless youve checked the option in the software center/software sources setting
[10:48] <k3lt> ok, thanks
[10:48] <MonkeyDust> dijit  have you asked in #ubuntu-server?
[10:49] <dijit> yes
[10:49] <dijit> it's very dead.

[10:51] <lotuspsychje> is there a quick mp4 to avi converter for ubuntu?
[10:51] <MonkeyDust> lotuspsychje  avconv -i
[10:51] <lotuspsychje> !info avconv
[10:51] <ubottu> Package avconv does not exist in quantal
[10:51] <dr_willis> diverdude: fuseftp or ftpfuse tools can do it. as one way
[10:52] <MonkeyDust> lotuspsychje  mind adding some options, to avoid quality loss
[10:52] <dr_willis> ffmpeg is avconv I thought
[10:52] <MonkeyDust> yes, it's the new generation ffmpeg

[10:53] <lotuspsychje> ok tnx guys, installing libavtools
[10:53] <extropy> huh, everyone seems to need support with linux issues that have nothing to do with ubuntu
[10:53] <hell_> hi
[10:54] <extropy> I'm always in here with real-world problems that relate directly to ubuntu and I always get they snarky "take it to ubuntu-offtopic" crap ...
[10:54] <dr_willis> your ranting is the issue for it.
[10:54] <jrib> extropy: like what?  What you're saying now certainly isn't an ubuntu support question ;)
[10:54] <Serano> extropy well since ubuntu is the most beginner friendly distro, that shouldn't be surprising
[10:54] <extropy> I'm starting to think you guys are just intimidated by anyone even remotely knowledgeable ... and would prefere to interact only with noobs who will *never* ask any hard-hitting questions.
[10:55] <Serano> anyway it's nice to see the curiosity :)
[10:55] <jrib> extropy: seriously, let's stick to support.
[10:55] <extropy> do try
[10:55] <MonkeyDust> extropy  it's n00bs, but better use the word 'beginner'

[11:03] <Serano> i'm sorry can't recall exactly. It's been over 6 months I had it installed. I remember the problem was that you were not able to buy from the Riot store.
[11:03] <Serano> but besides that, the game runned fine for me
[11:04] <Serano> now with the new overhaul of their interface, i'm not sure if the problem still exists
[11:04] <mrosmrducks> is defekt still on here?
[11:04] <extropy> this is boring. I'm not going to accomplish anything here, what else is new?
[11:05] <Serano> i love my rasp :)
[11:06] <mrosmrducks> can someone help me... i dled the ubuntu 32bit and tryed running with vbox and had no luck... defekt suggested i re dl and still had no luck... i tryed the check sum app and it said they do not compare... ne suggestions?
[11:06] <ichat> can anyone help me figure out how to troubleshoot and  fix  some  hardware  / chipset / bios-efi  issues with my sandy bridge    b830  notebook,  it wont halt anymore  just reboots when its halted...
[11:06] <extropy> HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!
[11:06] <Serano> mrosmrducks try installing it with apt-get
[11:06] <extropy> ichat welcome to the club
[11:06] <mrosmrducks> but i want to try to run it first before i install it
[11:06] <Serano> it should download any dependencies
[11:07] <ichat> extropy:  - same problem?
[11:07] <extropy> oh yeah
[11:07] <extropy> EUFI is the devil
[11:07] <jpds> extropy: Can you stop the random bashing?
[11:07] <extropy> jpds: not until the problem is fixed
[11:07] <diverdude> TakeItEZ, that did not help
[11:07] <Serano> extropy i'm not familiar with uefi system, since i love my 980x but is it such a pain?
[11:08] <diverdude> TakeItEZ, it still dont mount
[11:08] <jrib> extropy: then I'm going to have to remove you.  Please just stick to support here.
[11:08] <Serano> was thinking of upgrading soon
[11:08] <extropy> jrib: i'm here for support. Ban dr_willis and MonkeyDust if you *actually* want to remove any trolls. Otherwise I have plenty of proxies I can use ...
[11:09] <ichat> extropy:  first it went fine,    BUT  my wifi module had problems  when it went hybernate...  so i added the    realtec driver to  some   file  so that it unloads   before hybernation...
[11:09] <ichat> after that  change   (but im not sure if its the cause)   i notices my system wouldn  halt anymore
[11:09] <arashmousavi> I have connected to my server via ssh and create a process , but suddenly my internet connection disconnected. I know that process going on, but how can restore previous session to see the progress of it?
[11:09] <ixio2> anyone fancy telling me how I can use find to find the first 2500 files in a directory and move them to another ?
[11:10] <jrib> ixio2: first in what order?
[11:10] <jpds> arashmousavi: Not unless you used something like screen or byobu.
[11:10] <bekks> arashmousavi: There is no session to be restored after the ssh session was broken.
[11:10] <ixio2> jrid I dont care really
[11:10] <sw> Hi, I have a user 'backups' trying to access a samba share \\ip\backups from a Windows machine but can't get authorized. It's using the correct password and is in write users for that share. root is too and that works.
[11:10] <Serano> arashmousavi try using the screen program to have multiple session where you can disconnect from and reattach to
[11:10] <diverdude> I tried adding this to my /etc/fstab curlftpfs#uname:pwd@host /media/mountpoint fuse rw,allow_other,noauto,user 0 0     and do sudo mount -a. But it does not seem to mount anything. Is that totally wrong to do?
[11:10] <sw> Any help?
[11:11] <ixio2> I just want to move 2500 files at a time
[11:11] <jrib> ixio2: why only 2500?  Anyway, check out xargs.
[11:12] <mrosmrducks> my ubuntu wont run... says i have no pae kernel... NE help?
[11:12] <arashmousavi> no way?
[11:12] <diverdude> anyone?
[11:12] <jrib> arashmousavi: well why don't you connect to the server again and see if the process is even running anymore?
[11:13] <ixio2> ok I can understand xargs.. but what about finding the first 2500 files
[11:13] <ichat> jpds:  any help maybe? -
[11:13] <jrib> ixio2: xargs lets you specify the number of arguments
[11:13] <jpds> ichat: find . -type f | head -n 2500
[11:14] <jrib> ixio2: so you can do 2500 at a time as you said
[11:14] <ichat> jpds:  what does that do?
[11:14] <arashmousavi> jrib: I know, but the process gives me some information(output) that is necessary.
[11:14] <jpds> ichat: Sorry, that was for ixio2.
[11:14] <jrib> arashmousavi: so is the answer yes or no?  Is the process still running?
[11:14] <ichat> ow ok
[11:15] <ixio2> find . -type f | head -n 2500 -exec mv '{}' /new/path \;  <-- like this ?
[11:15] <bekks> ixio2: No.
[11:15] <bekks> ixio2: find . -type f | head -n 2500 | xargs ...
[11:15] <arashmousavi> jrib: yes
[11:16] <mrosmrducks> should i try dling the 64bit ubuntu for my 64bit win7 instead of the 32bit? maybe that would solve the prob
[11:16] <jrib> arashmousavi: what is the process and how did you start it?
[11:16] <bekks> mrosmrducks: That wont help you.
[11:16] <ixio2> find . -type f | head -n 2500 | xargs mv /new/path
[11:16] <mrosmrducks> =/
[11:16] <ixio2> like that ?
[11:16] <mrosmrducks> ne suggestions?
[11:16] <jrib> ixio2: can you say why you want to move 2500 at a time and not more?
[11:17] <diverdude> anyone?
[11:17] <jrib> !anyone | diverdude
[11:17] <ubottu> diverdude: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[11:17] <ixio2> jrib when they reach their desination they are procesed by another script which gets upset with too many files
[11:17] <jrib> !helpme | diverdude
[11:17] <ubottu> diverdude: Avoid following your questions with a trail of "Please, help me", "Can nobody help me?", "I really need this!", and so on. This just contributes to making the channel unreadable. If you are not answered, ask again later; but see also !repeat and !attitude
[11:17] <bono> ixio2: find . -type f | head -n 2500 | xargs -i mv "{}" /new/path
[11:17] <ixio2> thanks everyone!
[11:18] <jrib> ixio2: I see.  I would still say avoiding head and using xargs is going to be easier for you to work with.  Otherwise, you're going to be back here in two minutes asking how to get the second set of 2500 files
[11:18] <ixio2> I presumed by moving the files I could just run the same command again?
[11:19] <jrib> ixio2: good point :)
[11:19] <ixio2> cool
[11:19] <superkuh> This is a long shot, but, has anyone else had a problem with ATI/AMD Radeon cards wherein you cannot play more than 4 videos at once, in any player with any rendering method? The 5th always only plays sound.
[11:19] <ixio2> superkuh all my ati related video.sound issues are always resolved by downloading the development release of the driver from the AMD website

[11:20] <superkuh> Unfortunately my X server on Ubuntu 10.04 isn't compatible with the latest.
[11:20] <superkuh> I really wish I could.
[11:20] <bono> ixio2: problem: what if the filenames contain spaces .. normally one would use find .. -print0 | xargs -0 ..  but with head it wouldn't work
[11:20] <superkuh> Or, I wish I was wrong?
[11:20] <superkuh> Am I?
[11:21] <k3lt> So im now trying to install FGLRX ati drivers for my gfx (hd7850)
[11:21] <bono> ixio2: dunno if xargs -0 --max-lines 2500 works for this
[11:21] <k3lt> installed it and im getting "unsupported hardware" in my right screen corner
[11:21] <adamk> superkuh: Do you get any errors when you run the video player from a terminal window?
[11:21] <k3lt> what's that?
[11:22] <ixio2> bono the files will have lots of spaces
[11:22] <ixio2> its moved them though
[11:22] <bono> ixio2: the filenames too?
[11:23] <superkuh> ... as is often the case I have discovered it was user error only after complaining on IRC. With the gl renderer (which all my video players used) I hit that limit. If I switch to other renders which have horiztonal tearing I can go beyond 4.
[11:23] <ixio2> filenames yeah
[11:23] <diverdude> jrib, as i said,  I tried adding this to my /etc/fstab curlftpfs#uname:pwd@host /media/mountpoint fuse rw,allow_other,noauto,user 0 0     and do sudo mount -a. But it does not seem to mount anything. Is that totally wrong to do?
[11:23] <jrib> diverdude: I don't know.  I would have answered you if you did.  Just wanted to let you know that saying "anyone?" is not productive. Most people that just joined will have no idea what your question is.

[11:26] <Eagleman> How do i flush the dns cache in ubuntu/bind, dig is still resolving the wrong stuff
[11:29] <jrib> bono, ixio2: yes, if there are spaces in the names you should use -print0 with find and -0 with xargs.  You can still have head in between
[11:29] <kepler> Eagleman, try "sudo killall -HUP dnsmasq"
[11:30] <kepler> Eagleman, if not, this looks better:  sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean start
[11:35] <diverdude> in /etc/fstab i have this: curlftpfs#uname:pwd@ftp://host /media/ftpmountdir fuse rw,uid=1000,umask=0777,user,suid,allow_other,exec,auto,utf8 0 1. But when i do sudo mount -a i get: Error connecting to ftp: Access denied: 530. However if i put the exact same credentials into filezilla it connects with no problems. What am I missing?

I am considering for example only installing debian and run apt-get install <some-kde-app> and then let it install its dependencies.
[11:55] <skp1> MonkeyDust: thank you
[11:55] <ichat> can anyone help me  troubleshooting why my system reboots instead of halted,    im thinking of installing  the from the mainline ppa  but it seams that it would   disbable  me from updating the kernel later on and i would have to   do it manually for ever?
[11:55] <challenger> i'm trying to install XP in virtualbox. I've created VHD at fixed 30GB size . but now if i'm trying to boot xp.iso . it starts normally but after some time it says "setup did not find any hard disk "
[11:55] <challenger> http://imagebin.org/242488
[11:56] <MonkeyDust> Zhaboo  you need plasma-desktop
[11:56] <bekks> Zhaboo: How is that related to Ubuntu then?
[11:56] <nodoor> Can I move(have) aircrack in ubuntu ?
[11:56] <antonio_> so it looks like its only happening on firefox and not other browsers...
[11:56] <bekks> challenger: a) use vdi instead of vhd and b) do not use a SATA controller, but an IDE controller for XP.
[11:57] <Zhaboo> bekks: I wonder if there are any minimalist ubuntu versions with KDE that I could also consider.
[11:57] <ichat> challenger:  -1 small itp for you to search on... driverpacks.net    use the  mass storage pack    ALLWAYS  check for virusses first...
[11:57] <dr_willis> !mini | Zhaboo
[11:57] <ubottu> Zhaboo: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[11:58] <truexfan404> Zhaboo: i believe i remember the ubuntu minimal iso having an option for the kubuntu desktop
[11:58] <Kartagis> whew
[11:58] <challenger> bekks, ichat : thanks guys , :)
[11:58] <Kartagis> I got it back
[11:58] <dr_willis> Zhaboo:  check out that qtrazor project also.

[12:00] <bekks> challenger: which doesnt change the fact that vhd isnt the native format virtualbox is using, and does not offer you all of the features offered for vdi.
[12:01] <ichat> challenger like is said  use driverpacks...  on your xp iso, it will add not hardware support including sata and  iscsi   ...
[12:01] <bekks> ichat: Driver packs are not needed, SP3 is needed.

[12:03] <truexfan404> Fudge: do you have the printer shared via samba? thats the easiest way
[12:04] <challenger> yeah vdi is native format for virtualbox but i want to use that format on vmplayer too
[12:04] <ichat> funch:  so isntall the proper windows driver and have it connected via the correct,  protocol and be sure that  cubs is actually sharing it... or beter yet have samba share the printer for you
[12:04] <challenger> thats why i choose VHD
[12:04] <bekks> challenger: Resizing, compacting, etc.

[12:04] <ubottu> Zhaboo: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[12:04] <bekks> challenger: Then I'd use VMDK instead of VHD...

[12:05] <Zhaboo> ooops, heh
[12:05] <jnhghy> Fudge: what printer?
[12:05] <jnhghy> Hi, how/where can I set up a white list of sites to be accessible and all of the rest redirect to a specific ip address? using ubuntu 12.04
[12:06] <bekks> jnhghy: /etc/hosts is what you are looking for.
[12:06] <challenger> nywys.. bekks  :)
[12:06] <bekks> challenger: "nywys"?
[12:06] <Fudge> jnhghy  its an hp deskjet f2280
[12:06] <jnhghy> bekks: I was able to redirect websites to an Ip address but was unable to find a wildcard to replace all websites and not touch a the ones from the white list .... any ideea?
[12:07] <challenger> anyways...*
[12:07] <nabblet> hi, can anyone recommend me a free dyndns-like server? i want to access a computer behind a firewall that is NATing some ports through.
[12:07] <jnhghy> Fudge: how did you added the printer on win7? from control panel?
[12:07] <nabblet> server->service
[12:07] <bekks> jnhghy: There are no wildcards in the /etc/hosts
[12:07] <jnhghy> then how can it help me?
[12:08] <asdf321> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1519636/ I've just installed ubuntu amd64 lts, I want to run boot repair to see if it will work after I install windows, I am trying to run it... I have two encrypted volumes one for the / and other for the swap, i have a not encrypted /boot. it tried creating a /bios but it didn't work i still get the same message
[12:08] <wizrd> nabblet: dyndns
[12:09] <Fudge> jnhghy  add printer wizard, the printer is detected,
[12:09] <wizrd> nabblet: dyn.com
[12:09] <challenger> one more ques. .should i choose fixed size or dynamic ? bekks
[12:09] <Kartagis> for some reason, cairo-dock had two instancesu
[12:09] <Kartagis> s/u//
[12:10] <bekks> challenger: I'd use dynamic, most always.
[12:10] <challenger> bekks , would it be portable?
[12:10] <Fudge> dr_willis  /usr/lib/cups/backend/hp failed
[12:10] <jnhghy> Fudge: try changing the driver
[12:10] <jnhghy> Fudge in win7
[12:10] <Fudge> jnhghy  I dont think its a driver issue
[12:10] <MonkeyDust> challenger  you can export your virtual machines, to make them portable
[12:11] <nabblet> wizrd: afaik dyndns isn't free any more
[12:11] <bekks> challenger: Which format do you talk about now? :)
[12:11] <wizrd> nabblet: it still is for one subdomain
[12:11] <challenger>  hmmm for dynamic , vdi
[12:11] <challenger> oops
[12:11] <challenger> sorry :P
[12:12] <dr_willis> Fudge:  last i shared a printer to a windows box. I also set up home shares in /etc/samba/smb.conf and gave the users a samba password with 'sudo smbpasswd -a username'
[12:12] <challenger> MonkeyDust, .. exporting ..
[12:12] <dr_willis> Fudge:  i was also sure to use teh cups web interface to be sure the printers and server where shared and allowed access from the network
[12:12] <MonkeyDust> challenger  you can export them as .ova files
[12:12] <nabblet> wizrd: something like foo.dyn.com ?
[12:12] <Fudge> dr_willis samba was giving me trouble I dont know why
[12:12] <Fudge> makes me feel like going to buy a real network printer lol
[12:12] <dr_willis> Fudge:  cups web interface   http://localhost:631
[12:13] <bekks> challenger: Are you sure you can use a vdi with vmplayer? :)
[12:13] <challenger> isn't it good idea to configure everything for making it portable before installing
[12:13] <dr_willis> Fudge:  best $100 i spent was a brother network enabled laser printer
[12:13] <challenger> bekks : :X not so sure :P
[12:13] <Fudge> nabblet ` mooo.com is very easy to get going
[12:13] <bekks> challenger: Mostly, it is a pretty bad idea, when not using a portable format....
[12:13] <tuxinator> hi all
[12:13] <MonkeyDust> challenger  yes, the configuration is stored in the xported .ova file
[12:13] <tuxinator> does ubuntu mysql-server-5.1-66 from 10.04 come with openssl support?
[12:14] <challenger> MonkeyDust,  will it work on vmlayer too ? means can i import that file to vmplayer? .ova?
[12:14] <MonkeyDust> challenger  never used vmplayer, i'm no help there
[12:14] <asdf321> how do I create a mount point on gparted:?
[12:14] <challenger> bekks : now im totally confused  X:X )
[12:14] <craigbass1976> What is the best way to remote control an ubuntu box from a windows or mac that's out in the WAN?
[12:15] <dr_willis> craigbass1976:  ssh ;)
[12:15] <challenger> MonkeyDust,  :)
[12:15] <nabblet> Fudge: thx, will look at it. sad thing is that mosts dns service don't exactly specify what you get for free and where and the conditions :/
[12:15] <nabblet> Fudge: ofc it's totally understandable that they want paying custromers :D
[12:16] <challenger> pheww need to check vbox manuals RFM
[12:16] <Fudge> nabblet  ive set a few up on that site and its easy and no charge
[12:16] <Fudge> asdf321  just pull the box down and select a mount point, like /
[12:16] <asdf321> i don't see it anywhere
[12:16] <Fudge> dr_willis  when I view jobs on cups http the user heading says withheld
[12:17] <nabblet> Fudge: ok, thank you
[12:17] <Fudge> asdf321  are you installing and have received an error that you ahve not specifieed a mount point?
[12:17] <Fudge> nabblet np mate
[12:17] <dr_willis> Fudge:  the cups.org has docs and stuff.. but ive never seen that term used. ;) but ive not shared to a wqindows box in years
[12:17] <asdf321> Fudge, yes
[12:17] <asdf321> i am using crypto
[12:17] <asdf321> but i have a /boot not encrypted
[12:17] <Fudge> asdf321 go back, select your partition and where you choose format etc there is a mount poiint box, thats where you select
[12:18] <Johnnie> I had downloaded Ubuntu.iso and It did not boot. There are files with .exe. What's wrong? ISO had been burned.
[12:18] <Fudge> I have not set it up that way, but its when you edit teh partition you specify mount points asdf321 good luck
[12:18] <asdf321> there is no mount point box
[12:18] <bekks> Johnnie: Did you burn it as image, or did you burn a data cd?
[12:19] <typhlosion> hi i want to go to linuxmint-help channel how to do that
[12:19] <Johnnie> bekks: Like image
[12:19] <bekks> Johnnie: What happened exactly when trying to boot it?
[12:19] <MonkeyDust> typhlosion  #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[12:20] <craigbass1976> dr_willis, ahaha.  You funny guy, you.  He'd like that about as much as me telling him to stop using windows and macs...
[12:20] <Tex_Nick> asdf321 : this is of course after the fact ... but the preferable method to setup a dual boot ( windows & ubuntu ) is to install windows first ... tis a little easier that way
[12:20] <asdf321> I couldn't
[12:20] <asdf321> because I installed it and the ubuntu installer didn't see anything but one partition only with 1TB
[12:20] <wizrd> nabblet: exactly like foo.dyn.com. You have to register for a pro trial and cancel that within 14 days. then you'll keep the subdomain.
[12:21] <asdf321> also the debian installer didn't see it either

BUT after i  do   apt-get-purge linux-image-3.7  (so reverted back to my main kernel)  the shotwon issue seams away....  how can i troubleshoot,

[12:37] <challenger> and how can i detect my cam inside vbox?
[12:37] <challenger> it works fine on cheese and other cam apps
[12:37] <MonkeyDust> challenger  it's probably a USB device, check the vbox USB settings
[12:38] <challenger> MonkeyDust,  it is attached to my laptop . (lenovo)

[12:38] <dr_willis> challenger:   You are running teamviewer in vbox?

[12:40] <ichat> challenger do a  sudo lsusb  find your webcam id... and than forward the device in your  vbux  usb  settings... it may require the  nonfree  extention...
[12:41] <dr_willis> freakynl:    You can do a full install onto a usb flah drive.  ive ran that way for months on end. :) never managed to  break one.

[12:42] <freakynl> and it would be running for years (~4-5 or so) :)
[12:43] <ichat> challger you mean it works for cheese install inside the virtual machine or cheese on the host
[12:43] <challenger> ichat: how ? X) :P
[12:43] <dr_willis> Hmm.. is vsftp a 'sftp' server?  i thoght ssh could do sftp wthout any other services
[12:43] <ee12096> Francisco silva
[12:43] <challenger> cheese on the host
[12:44] <freakynl> raven_: don't you mean ftps? sftp is a whole other protocol than ftp and comes from ssh
[12:44] <ichat> challernger so  read up on how to forward usb devices to clients  on virtualbox
[12:44] <freakynl> ftps however is just regular FTP with a SSL layer, similar to http vs https
[12:44] <raven_> freakynl, i need any "secure ftp" service
[12:44] <ichat> aka just coppy paste to google...
[12:45] <dr_willis> raven_:  ssh and sftp would be the way to go i imagine. a ftp server  is rarely needed these days i find.
[12:45] <challenger> ichat : )   lemme try this one too, i'm facing this one prob from 6 months cudn't get any solution , even tried mint , fedora
[12:45] <raven_> dr_willis, yes sftp would be nice but how to setup - what do i need for that?
[12:46] <dr_willis> raven_:  install the ssh server.. and it should work i belive
[12:46] <ichat> dr_willis:  sft gets quite some overhead on large files... but than again  id use dav
[12:46] <raven_> dr_willis, i need to work with virtual users they all have access to the same subfolder and have no access to shell
[12:46] <dr_willis> I use ssh/sftp from my android pone.
[12:47] <dr_willis> raven_:  i imagine its doable. I never need to do that.
[12:47] <raven_> dr_willis, and i need any idea how
[12:47] <dr_willis> not sure why that would need 'virtual users'
[12:47] <dr_willis> sounds like normal 'groups' could do that.
[12:48] <dr_willis> theres all sorts of books and guides on ssh/sftp  most of which ive never needed to read. ;)
[12:48] <freakynl> raven_: http://howto.gumph.org/content/setup-virtual-users-and-directories-in-vsftpd/ (for debian, but ubuntu is debian based so shouldn't matter much)

[12:49] <raven_> freakynl, i set up a vsftpd server already but i cannot connect to it
[12:49] <freakynl> raven_: please post output on pastebin or something: 'netstat -ntl; iptables -L -v -n'

[13:24] <Median> So I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my ASUS UX32A, but the installer/ubuntu refuses to start. It successfully loads all modules and such, but gets stuck at "Starting.." just before it was going to start Ubuntu. Any ideas?
[13:25] <TomyLobo> can "kdesudo su otheruser -c /home/otheruser/one_of_his_programs" harm me?
[13:26] <TomyLobo> can "kdesudo -- su otheruser -c /home/otheruser/one_of_his_programs" harm me?
[13:27] <dcherniv> TomyLobo, yes
[13:27] <jrib> TomyLobo: why don't you use sudo -u instead of using su like that?
[13:30] <TomyLobo> jrib, that definitely gives the program access to my files
[13:30] <jrib> TomyLobo: what do you mean?
[13:30] <TomyLobo> at least that's what dr_willis indicated earlier
[13:31] <TomyLobo> basically the program is some proprietary shit i dont trust and i set up a user for it
[13:31] <jrib> TomyLobo: it runs the command as the user you specify
[13:32] <TomyLobo> so it has a nice box to act in while the rest of my system, including my home folder, is safe from it
[13:32] <jrib> TomyLobo: the difference between doing <unconvertable> sudo -u user command <unconvertable> and <unconvertable> su -c command user <unconvertable> is that in the first case you use the fact you have sudo powers to run as the other user and in the second case you actually need to be able to login as user
[13:33] <TomyLobo> jrib, su does not ask for a password if run as root :)
[13:33] <jrib> TomyLobo: correct
[13:33] <TomyLobo> hence the kdesudo before it
