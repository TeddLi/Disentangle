[07:11] <Jordan_U> lgc: All I can think of is to try to remove any packages that you may have gotten from the debian repo and then install ubuntu-desktop, I would go on a package removing spree and just be ready to be stuck with only a terminal or a chroot ( using a LiveCD ) it may be easier to re-install though

[07:18] <eternalswd> _`XeOn_, okay, so that's where you put it

[07:19] <agliv5> eternalswd, you wouldn't happen to know a good source?
[07:19] <Jordan_U> lgc: you enabled main though, so that means that any packages that were newer in debian were installed from the debian repo automatically, and that could be a lot of packages

[07:38] <agliv5> mencoder does everything he he he
[07:38] <arrenlex> zYe: I.E. Mencoder is exactly what it says -- an encoder. i.e. you can reencode a movie, or apply video filters, or cut it, or pull it up, or other technical things. But you can't splice a clip of your horse onto a clip of your daughter and add shiny text.
[07:38] <arrenlex> zYe: Also, mencoder is commandline

[08:54] <AmaroqWolf> They're ethernet cables. If they fit, they'll work.
[08:54] <dezinezan> ahm
[08:55] <n4cht> dezinezan, you'd need a switch or a router.  (another piece of hardware) since most DSL modems double as single-port routers, you can likely go the cheaper route and just pick up a switch for about $20USD.

[08:55] <AmaroqWolf> Well, if you look on the back of the router, ther'll be plugins like the ones on the back of your computer.
[08:55] <someone303> L8R all
[08:55] <n4cht> check the bottom of the DSL modem itself.  it'll say if it's a router or not.

[08:56] <donovan> dezinezan, do you know if the Mac has a wireless network adapter installed?
[08:56] <AmaroqWolf> On the back of your router, should be three or four plugs close to eachother, with another plug off to the left sorta by itself.
[08:56] <dezinezan> ok i have the modem that CAME to set up the highspeed DSL, then the other day we bought a D-Link  Wireless Router

[08:57] <AmaroqWolf> Look on the back of your router, there should be those plugins that look like the big phone cord plugin.
[08:57] <donovan> if your mac doesn't have a wireless adapter, you can't connect wirelessly

[08:58] <dezinezan> but..
[08:58] <high-freq> can someone plz tell me what file to edit to change my locale
[08:58] <n4cht> dezinezan, excellent.  ok, all you need to do is plug an ethernet cable between the mac and the router, and the rest should be pie.   (however, you might want to check the model of your mac on the apple website, it likely has a wireless adapter built-in.)

[08:59] <AmaroqWolf> dezinizan, you can plug a cable from your modem into the LAN slot. That'll give the internet to your router. Then you can plug one computer into the 1 slot, and another computer into the 2 slot.

[09:00] <agliv5> eternalswd, thanks for all your help :) I've been working on this for days...

[09:02] <n4cht> dezinezan, what port on the back of the router is the modem plugged into?
[09:02] <dezinezan> ahmm
[09:02] <n4cht> that's a very crucial step.
[09:03] <dezinezan> actually i unplugged EVERYTHING and stuck with JUST the modem for now until i could find further help
[09:03] <AmaroqWolf> zezinezan, if everything is connected right, it should automatically be connected. No dial in required.
[09:03] <donovan> dezinezan, sometimes yes, sometimes no. Windows frequently auto-detects the network but idk about other OS's...however, there should be a control panel option somewhere in there to configure networking

[09:23] <eternalswd> rc-1, if you uninstall flash, that should do the trick, or try the FlashBlock extension.

[09:24] <eternalswd> rc-1, it's easy to install flash 9, just download the installer from adobe and copy the plugins to ~/.mozilla/plugins, or it should be in backports
[09:25] <grol> scv - what do you mean with "junk know"
[09:25] <rc-1> eternalswd, thats not the problem, i have flash 9
[09:25] <n4cht> Rajiv2: you just made me cry a little inside.  i tried doing that myself through my sprint vision pcs phone, since it doubles as a modem... and it was a terrifying experience that i never want to relive.  however, chances are one of these fine chaps will be able to get you up and running!  full of knowledge they are!

[09:26] <Rajiv2> When I try to dial out gets stuck on the step that says intializing modem
[09:26] <grol> scv, i tried first with ndiswrapper but found on dapper rt2470
[09:26] <eternalswd> rc-1, ah, then I'd suggest installing adblock plus

=== peace-keeper [n=peace-ke@pnsgw1-client141.demo.tuwien.ac.at]  has joined #ubuntu
[09:26] <AmaroqWolf> rc-1, here's a little trick. If you wan't to close firefox without losing your tabs. Forecequit it, go into your system manager, and end anything firefox. Then next time you start it, it'll ask you if you want to restore the session. :P
[09:26] <AmaroqWolf> I think you gotta have firefox 2 though, for that.
[09:26] <n4cht> Rajiv2: AH!  You just reminded me of the olden days, which I won't get into lest I date myself, but that really just means you need to find out with that proper init string for the modem is.
[09:26] <AzMoo> AmaroqWolf, or the tab mix plus plugin.
[09:27] <eternalswd> rc-1, it'd also be a good idea to install noscript and only allow trusted sites to run javascript.  that'll kill a bunch of the problems
[09:27] <scv> grol, iirc, g-132 was even supported by bsd
[09:27] <rc-1> Amaranth, yes i do that, but when i do it reloads the crashing site
[09:27] <AmaroqWolf> AzMoo, I always wondered if there was a plugin for saving tabs.
[09:27] <rc-1> eternalswd, its flash i already have adblock/noscript
[09:27] <Rajiv2> I have a init string from my service provider but where do I paste it
[09:27] <Rajiv2> In initialisation string 1
[09:27] <Rajiv2> ?
[09:27] <frogzoo> AmaroqWolf: there is
[09:27] <rc-1> AzMoo, ill pm u the link once i can see what it is
[09:27] <n4cht> Rajiv2: That sounds about right.
[09:27] <AzMoo> rc-1, hah, thanks.
[09:27] <eternalswd> rc-1, then just uninstall flash or install the flashblock extension

[09:29] <n4cht> Rajiv2: Weird.  You've got me totally stumped then.  If the init phase is what hangs, but the init string is supposedly the proper one (according to your isp) then the only thing I can suggest is double checking that init string through the mfg of the modem.
[09:29] <AmaroqWolf> Here's an interesting question. I have a CD rom drive. It has a button on the door. It pops out when I press it. However, when I have a CD in it, and I press the button, it does nothing. I have to eject the CD via telling it to eject from the system for it to eject. Is there a way I can make the button eject when there's a CD in it?
=== sby_twenty is now known as cwek
[09:29] <rc-1> eternalswd, thanks i wish there was a better way though :( whats the command to remove flash? (i cant use firefox to lookup! :(
[09:29] <eternalswd> rc-1, then uninstall it, install flashblock and reinstall it, then you should have control over what flash content is actually used.
[09:29] <Rajiv2> n4cht is there anyway I can get a hold of you I have to go out for a meeting
[09:29] <n4cht> AmaroqWolf: You have to unmount the drive.  :)
