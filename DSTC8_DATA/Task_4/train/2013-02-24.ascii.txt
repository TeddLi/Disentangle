[22:23] <_d4vid> Monotoko, my questions was .. i will to install 12.04.2 but i dont know what for version kernel i become after install 3.2 or 3.5?

[22:23] <Monotoko> blackroseblade, I answered that one too... have a look at unetbootin
[22:23] <SolarisBoy> Eino_: ls -l /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/
[22:23] <Monotoko> it'll allow to create a USB drive with persistent storage
[22:24] <Eino_> at total 0
[22:24] <_d4vid> k1l, thank you .. also 3.5?
[22:24] <k1l> _d4vid: with .2 you will have the new kernel stack. when upgrading from .1 you neeed to add a package to get new kernel
[22:24] <_d4vid> k1l, no i will new install not upgrade
[22:25] <blackroseblade> Yeah but can't I change my current one to persistence? I'll google up unetbootin
[22:25] <Eino_> SolarisBoy: It says translated: "at total 0"
[22:25] <Monotoko> blackroseblade, I don't think so
[22:25] <blackroseblade> What about this: http://shallowsky.com/blog/linux/install/ubuntu-persistent-live-cd.html
[22:25] <blackroseblade> I tried that, except the target was invalid(not found)

[22:35] <meyer> Is there any solution to remap memory without the option on my bios? Please
[22:35] <Fah> jon_w: where's it installed? Is that directory in root's path?
[22:35] <k1l> Eino_: i told you to stop your ranting and flaming.
[22:35] <k1l> Eino_: stick to the support issues or leave
[22:35] <jon_w> Fah: no, under "~/.rvm/"
[22:36] <Monotoko> I'm surprised he actually left
[22:36] <jon_w> Fah: user home dir
[22:36] <Fah> jon_w: then add it to your path. But why do you even need to run that as root?

[22:38] <smcguinness> I'm unable to resolve the issue as they have, because I cannot access /etc/default/grub
[22:38] <blackroseblade> Eino ragequit then i assume
[22:38] <blackroseblade> since i hid my joins and parts
[22:38] <Fah> jon_w: i dont know what you're doing but if you add it to PATH, you can run it. If you're writing to a shared filesystem make sure you don't break permissions for users
[22:39] <smcguinness> has anyone run into the timing issue with a monitor on a new install and resolved it?
[22:39] <jon_w> Fah: I'm afraid to break user permissions

[22:45] <otak> Tex_Nick: why?
[22:46] <madsailor>  I cant min/close a window that is maxed from the titlebar in 12.04 after last update. Controls are replaced with window title on mouseover.  Any help? Pic here: http://imgur.com/iU3ffIo .  The three controls top left by mouse.
[22:47] <Tex_Nick> otak : in order to block any url that contains "partialName"
[22:47] <otak> ah you mean /etc/hosts.deny
[22:48] <Tex_Nick> otak : yes ... sorry i should have elaborated ;0
[22:48] <k1l> Meyer2436: what was the issue again?
[22:48] <Meyer2436> xD
[22:48] <Meyer2436> My issue is a global issue
[22:48] <Meyer2436> i mean
[22:49] <Meyer2436> i've a problem with my installed RAM
[22:50] <Meyer2436> my MB is able to do dual channel ( and there is only 2 slots so no difficulty ) but my pc only recognize 3.1 gb ram ( both on win7 and ubuntu x64 )
[22:50] <Meyer2436> PS : my BIOS detect 4gb ram at the start
[22:50] <k1l> Meyer2436: well, does the vga take some ram?
[22:50] <rickb> my system was unrecoverable. no data on it so i wiped it. i'm going to give that howto a shot once it's loaded back up.
[22:50] <Meyer2436> I think
[22:50] <Meyer2436> but there is also a remap memory problem i think
[22:51] <ghoti> Anybody have a favourite _simple_ OCR program?  I'm hoping for something that'll let me simply `ocrbuddy somefile.png > output.txt`, with line breaks where there are line breaks, no need for multi-column, etc.
[22:51] <otak> yes I believe so, all this is well covered in old debian howtos

[22:55] <Meyer2436> k1l , are you still here xD?
[22:55] <k1l> yep
[22:55] <Meyer2436> have you any idea about this
[22:55] <packetfrog> :(
[22:55] <packetfrog> squid!
[22:55] <packetfrog> haha like that
[22:55] <k1l> i dont know about remapping ram. but if your mainboard vga takes 0.9GB ram you have to set that in the bios, if possible
[22:56] <Meyer2436> because my bios hasn't this option ( remap memory ) and no update available for it
[22:56] <Meyer2436> right but i see no option about this

[23:05] <Glagnar> i mean its quite computationally intensive but its not using 100% of my cpu which i dont understand
[23:06] <bekks> Glagnar: Then you have to investigate the source code, and possibly rewrite it for using 100% of your CPU.

[23:15] <Plizzo> I have a RAID5 array which used to consist of three 2TB drives. Last week I added another drive and after that I grew the array to include four devices. Although, I forgot to modify the filesystem size. I will attempt to do this overnight, but I'm wondering if this command is correct: "mdadm --grow /dev/md0 --size=max"
[23:16] <Physicist> Later I had deleted one fgrlx file of my system my pc is a little slow.. I really do not know what is the file, but, it happened. Should I reinstall my driver now!
[23:16] <k1l> WBF: which desktop are you running now?
[23:16] <bekks> Plizzo: That willnot change the filesystem size at all.
[23:16] <jkobyp> atc3030: check your usb ports, sounds like somebody plugged in a wireless mouse just to mess with you

[23:17] <Plizzo> bekks: Why not? I currently have 6TB in my array, but the partition is only 4TB. How can I fix that?
[23:17] <bekks> Plizzo: That will change the size of the md0 device, but not of the filesystem you created on md0.
[23:17] <bekks> Plizzo: Dont mix up device size, partition size, filesystem size.
[23:17] <Physicist> I am now using the new 13.02 beta driver of AMD. A good choice by the way.
[23:17] <SolarisBoy> resize2fs to the rescue

[23:18] <mdh> Plizzo: you can use gparted if you want, that'll do that
[23:18] <bekks> Plizzo: Depends on the filesystem type.
[23:18] <k1l> WBF: so you cant find the logout menu entry in the session indicator?
[23:18] <Physicist> On Kubuntu... Other good choice.. KDE is the best of all.
[23:18] <nu2ub_> <KromiX> it is in the pastebin

[23:21] <Plizzo> bekks: Also, I learned that when adding a disk to a mdadm array, the disk would be formatted automatically. I added a disk (/dev/sde) which had an GPT System on it and two partitions. It is now part of my RAID but still has a GUID table. What do I do?
[23:22] <k1l> WBF: see if this works: http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=20591
[23:22] <bekks> Plizzo: First, you have to tell us which filesystem type you are using.
[23:22] <nu2ub_> 'KromiX' you here
[23:22] <Deskarano> would ubuntu still work if i converted the hard drive that its on into a dynamic disk?
[23:22] <Plizzo> bekks: How do I check?
[23:23] <bekks> Plizzo: By looking at the output of "mount" or "sudo blkid"
[23:24] <nu2ub_> anyone able to help me with wireless
[23:24] <Plizzo> bekks: I used df -T
[23:24] <Plizzo> bekks: /dev/md0               ext4
[23:24] <mdh> nu2ub_: what's the problem with the wireless?
[23:24] <k1l> !ask | nu2ub_
[23:24] <ubottu> nu2ub_: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[23:24] <bekks> Plizzo: Then you can just use resize2fs  after growing md0.
[23:24] <Deskarano> would ubuntu still work if i converted the hard drive that its on into a dynamic disk?
[23:24] <Fah> So, anyone using rEFIt to boot ubuntu on a mac? I need to recover my install
[23:25] <bekks> Plizzo: that will then grow the ext4 filesystem on md0.
[23:25] <Plizzo> bekks: It says 3845715976 1K-blocks, 3599869600 used and 50495184 available. That should mean it could be expanded for quite a bit of more space?
[23:25] <nu2ub_> did a fresh install but after reboot the system is not picking up any wireless addreses
[23:25] <bekks> Plizzo: I have no clue "what" says that, and which command you are running. Nor is that the complete output of a command.
[23:26] <nu2ub_> mdh
[23:26] <mdh> nu2ub_: what kind of wireless adapter do you have? or which model of laptop?
[23:26] <nu2ub_> k1l
[23:26] <Plizzo> bekks: So I just run "resize2fs /dev/md0" and it should all be ok?
[23:26] <nu2ub_> I have a gateway NV 58
[23:26] <WBF> gonna try it now k1l
[23:27] <nu2ub_> the wireless worked when i was using ubuntu 12.10 and while I had the new installation DVD
[23:27] <nu2ub_> running
[23:27] <bekks> Plizzo: No. You should carefully read the options and the usage of resize2fs: "man resize2fs"

[23:27] <ubottu> The Ubuntu tablet can be discussed in #ubuntu-tablet or #ubuntu-discuss, please remember that #ubuntu is for support only.
[23:27] <amigamia> thanks
[23:27] <nu2ub_> so during install it was working but now the wireless options are shaded and it is not picking any of the channels
[23:27] <Deskarano> would ubuntu still work if i converted the hard drive that its on into a dynamic disk?
[23:28] <Glagnar> cheers bekks thats increased the speed although not to 100%
[23:29] <nu2ub_> how do i make my name turn red when i am addressing a specific person
[23:29] <ntzrmtthihu777> hello all
[23:29] <luckybunny> guys my computer's doing it again. This time I know very well that I had (or rather have) over 90GB of free space. But the command 'df -h' gives me a full disk, as well as repeated warnings
[23:29] <ntzrmtthihu777> nu2ub_: type their name and it usually does
[23:29] <Plizzo> bekks: I've read the man page, and there are not many options for the kind of operation I'm performing...
[23:30] <nu2ub_> ntzrmtthihu777 thanks
[23:30] <Glagnar> can someone give me a resource to using the cpu to 100% please
[23:30] <bekks> Plizzo: Those few options my render your filesystem in chaos.

[23:31] <Glagnar> or setting the priortry of a process
[23:31] <Fah> luckybunny: you've given no specific information about what is wrong.
[23:31] <nu2ub_> any command that will show the hardware type
[23:31] <bekks> Plizzo: You should just understand what those options do and you have to decide wether you want them or better not use them.
[23:31] <ntzrmtthihu777> yeah, is it pci or usb?
[23:31] <bekks> Plizzo: Most likely, you do NOT want to disable safety checks, e.g.
[23:31] <luckybunny> Fah: my disk is reading as full, when I know it has over 90GB of free space
[23:32] <nu2ub_> mdh the hardware was working with ubuntu 12.10 and while I was using the installation CD.
[23:32] <Fah> luckybunny: that seems improbable. Are you getting errors? Have you looked at what df shows for disk usage?
[23:33] <Guest17476> when installing wine i get the error message package dependencies cannot be resolved is it possible for my system to use wine ? or do i need  to go back to windows?
[23:33] <luckybunny> df -h shows the disk 100% used
[23:33] <nu2ub_> mdh the installation cd for this Install (edubun 12.04 lts)
[23:33] <mdh> nu2ub_: is the wireless connection showing up in the connection manager, just no access points showing up?
[23:33] <Fah> luckybunny: well it's probably full. Have you seen what the biggest directories are?
[23:34] <luckybunny> I have not downloaded anything (especially not anything 90GB in size) in the past day, but I had 90GB free this morning
[23:34] <Fah> luckybunny: so? is something spewing log messages? Is something writing stuff to the filesystem? the only way to find it is to look
[23:35] <luckybunny> ok... how do I do that?
[23:35] <nu2ub_> mdh yes a blank wireless adapter is showing but no networks and the wireless connections button used to search for connections can't be clicked as it is shaded
[23:35] <mdh> nu2ub_: i really don't know what could be causing that, sorry
[23:36] <Fah> luckybunny: start with du  on the full file system? do -k /mount/point | sort -nr | head -n 20 to see the top 20 largest dirs? Then drill down from there
[23:36] <Plizzo> bekks: I've been through multiple tutorials and neither of them use any kinds of options for the command. Look at this for example... http://www.allmyit.com.au/mdadm-growing-raid5-array-ubuntu
=== l is now known as Guest52447
[23:36] <ntzrmtthihu777> nu2ub_: lspci should list your wireless card
[23:36] <nu2ub_> mdh thanks for trying
[23:37] <Glagnar> im really sorry for spamming but ive set nice to -19 but my programme is still only using 9-15% of my cpu what can i do to make it use 100%?
[23:37] <nu2ub_> ntzrmtthihu777 will try that
[23:37] <bekks> Plizzo: You should understand what those options do and why you dont want them, instead of comparing zillions off howtos.
[23:37] <notStewpid> Has anyone here created a wifi hotspot b4?
[23:38] <Plizzo> bekks: I understand what the options do.. but clearly I don't need them since not a single person that used them used the options..
[23:38] <bekks> Plizzo: People often do use them when needed.
[23:39] <nu2ub_> ntzrmtthihu777 i dont see any problems there
[23:39] <Plizzo> bekks: Can I ask you something? When I used sudo mdadm --examine /dev/sdd I get this response:
[23:39] <bekks> Plizzo: But as long as you really do know why you dont want to use them, you are safe.
[23:39] <Plizzo> bekks: MBR Magic : aa55
[23:39] <Plizzo> Partition[0] :   3907027120 sectors at         2048 (type fd)
[23:39] <Fah> Glagnar: if you want load, while true; do true; done
[23:39] <Plizzo> bekks: But then when I examine my latest addition to the array, /dev/sde I get this:
[23:39] <notStewpid> wifi hotspots anyone?
[23:40] <Fah> Glagnar: run a bunch of threads
[23:40] <bekks> Plizzo: Use a pastebin service please.
[23:40] <Plizzo> bekks: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5560109/
[23:40] <Plizzo> bekks: And this is /dev/sdd: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5560110/
[23:40] <bekks> Plizzo: And...?
[23:41] <Plizzo> The response is much different, and they're all active disks in the RAID?
[23:41] <bekks> Plizzo: You have to check wether they are members of the RAID. I cant guess it.
[23:41] <Physicist> I'd tryed crack my own wireless with backtrack but could not because a broadcom driver of my system.. I did not know. now I know that. I will try again with no index error.
[23:41] <Plizzo> bekks: They are members of the raid
[23:41] <ntzrmtthihu777> nu2ub_: if you can find out what kind of wireless card you have you can be more specific in your searches for help, is it a broadcom sta?
[23:41] <bekks> Plizzo: So your question is answered, isnt it? :)
[23:42] <Plizzo> bekks: No, why does the response differ?
[23:42] <Plizzo> bekks: I mean, shouldn't it all be the same?
[23:42] <Glagnar> Fah: this is my code it should be at 100% but it isn't ?: http://pastebin.com/LepV5ihf
[23:42] <Physicist> Backtrack use KDE environment too.. I lake that. But I do not know what is the environment of Slackware that I am downloading.
[23:42] <Plizzo> bekks: Or maybe /dev/sde has become a main disk of some sort? It says the array is linear so I guess it has to have a starting unit
[23:42] <bekks> Plizzo: Not necessarily, the output heavily depends on your hardware setup.
[23:43] <Physicist> **like**
[23:43] <notStewpid> hotspot help?
[23:43] <Plizzo> bekks: Alright, well thanks. I'm sorry for bombarding you with questions. I'm decent with Linux but I'm just terrified that any misstake will completely wipe my array :/
[23:43] <bekks> notStewpid: Did you already ask a specific question?

[23:50] <bekks> packetfrog: Why are you trying to reinstall dpkg?
[23:50] <bekks> The error message is pretty clear: you dont have a kernel package installed.

[00:03] <bekks> !root | nu2ub_
[00:03] <ubottu> nu2ub_: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[00:03] <ntzrmtthihu777> why would you want to ? I can tell you how, but for what reason?
[00:03] <ldiamond> COLORS, it's not like an obvious system popup.
[00:03] <mneptok> ldiamond: whatever crashed was running as a system process, and its logfiles are readable only by root. thus the need for your password.

[00:03] <COLORS> hmm
[00:03] <ntzrmtthihu777> ldiamond: its legit, lol.

[00:33] <Penguin_> Thing is, I've never done it before, and the first time I even tried to install a linux distro was a few days ago
[00:33] <Penguin_> So I'm pretty confused about how to actually do it
[00:33] <notStewpid> nonan: It worked with windows 7 on connectify, and it also works with other wireless networks, so I doubt it.
[00:34] <AZ0R> i installed ubuntu while i was running windows and it installed it as a fat32 sharing the same format

[00:35] <Penguin_> I'll give some background on my situation: I installed Ubuntu on a laptop a few days ago, alongside Windows Vista, to repurpose it into something useful. The problem is that, after installing a few updates on Ubuntu a few hours ago, I got an error, and since then I haven't been able to boot up the PC.
[00:35] <rickb> works wonderfully
[00:35] <MoPac> I'm wondering about whether there are good programs or command sets for running "macro"-like operations on Ubuntu desktops. E.g., say I want to go into a game mode and so issue pause commands in some programs, close other programs, adjust my cpupower profile, etc with one click
[00:35] <nearst> Penguin_, nah. grub im guess
[00:36] <MoPac> Is this something I need to script into a file myself, or are there off-the-shelf soltuions?  I'm particularly interested in commands to close programs that aren't "pkill"
[00:36] <nearst> Penguin_, http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd/

[00:36] <Biomechd> i can't seem to access my software sources, and i keep getting random ubuntu 12.10 errors.
[00:36] <Penguin_> I can't even access the BIOS, so I'm guessing I fucked up pretty badly. That's why I'm trying to run a Live CD with Ubuntu, to at least salvage my files. @nearst, I have no idea what you meant by "remastersys", "uck" or "ubuntu-builder", nor "lfs". I'm inexperienced in this, eh
[00:36] <Biomechd> i also don't recall being able to install anything.

[01:20] <mrproper> escott: it's just a question. Curiosity
[01:20] <usr13> mrproper: Disable single user mode?  Not sure why but I guess you could delete that entry in the config.
[01:20] <scooby> escott: I assume so, I got to the terminal from the gui desktop - if that is what you mean
[01:21] <escott> mrproper, ^^ the user can always just add it back. physical access is root access is the general principle followed for the last 50 years
[01:21] <yown> What channel should I got to, to ask for advice on which linux distro to use?
[01:21] <escott> scooby, ps aux | grep gnome-session; killall gnome-session
[01:21] <cfhowlett> yown, #linux
[01:21] <fat> how do i configure docky. please help. i can't create any applications on it
[01:21] <k1l> yown: #linux
[01:22] <mrproper> escott: yes, but anyway. Is there a way? I mean, I don't want a user to user single user mode even if he/she is editing the grub entry and editing it by hand
[01:22] <Jeremy3D> i'm not sure if anyone can answer this. i download a new build of Blender every couple of days. I have some scripts/addons that I want to always have available, but dont want to have to move them in each build folder. anyone think they can help?
[01:23] <cfhowlett> Jeremy3D, #blender is the place for that question
[01:23] <ntzrmtthihu777> later all
[01:23] <cfhowlett> Jeremy3D, or possibly #ubuntustudio
[01:23] <Jeremy3D> cfhowlett, asked there but noone on uses ubuntu. :\
[01:23] <cfhowlett> mrproper, perhaps better to password protect the grub?
[01:23] <scooby> escott: I guess I am not really running gnome-session - at least according to ps - so what am I running - I am using this very system now and have this chat opened throug chatzilla etc - so I have a session
[01:24] <escott> scooby, what desktop environment are you using
[01:24] <mrproper> cfhowlett: yes, I know. There are hundred of better options. Is just a question xD

[01:24] <magn3ts> Why does Steam suck so much at packaging?
[01:24] <scooby> escott: this system is xfce - this one is running xubuntu
[01:24] <fbc_> Is there any solution to installing ubuntu on a UEFI  LENOVO z475 with no legacy mode?
[01:25] <cfhowlett> Jeremy3D, I would think that a new build of blender means it doesn't pick up your preferences/links etc.  Thus the need to specify for each build ...
[01:25] <usr13> mrproper: After you do that, you'll also need to set the PC to only boot the HD and password protect the BIOS as well.
[01:25] <cfhowlett> magn3ts, as no here actually works for Valve, perhaps direct your query elsewhere?  Valve support maybe ...
[01:25] <escott> mrproper, to secure your system from a physical access attack you need (a) a case intrusion device (b) password protected uefi (c) secure boot (d) password protected grub (e) a version of grub that only boots signed kernels (f) a signed kernel (g) a secure system
[01:26] <escott> scooby, i dont know what they use but its not gnome-session. ps aux | grep session might say
[01:26] <cfhowlett> fbc_, 12.4.2 has a uefi workaround
[01:26] <escott> usr13, i laugh at your attempts to secure a system with a mere bios password
[01:27] <Gavilan3> cfhowlett: I followed that link, I still see unity...
[01:27] <fbc_> cfhowlett, please go on.
[01:27] <cfhowlett> Gavilan3, you have to logout.  then you choose the environment you want to work with.  log in ....
[01:28] <Gavilan3> cfhowlett: I restarted which includes logging out
[01:28] <scooby> escott: there is an xfce-session - I will try killing that I guess  - so if it works: thanks and good bye
[01:29] <cfhowlett> fbc_, without the tech-babble, ubuntu 12.4.2 has a UEFI workaround allowing you to install on a uefi equipped machine without bricking it.  applies mostly to samsung.  sorry I can't be more specific as I haven't yet dealt with UEFI issues on my '09 dell.
[01:29] <fbc_> cfhowlett, Any link or a guide you can point me to?
[01:30] <cfhowlett> fbc_, lenovo ... what model?
[01:30] <fbc_> cfhowlett, z475
[01:30] <scooby> escott: TY so much - killing the xfce4-session seems to give me exactly what I want - it is NOT elegant but appears to work
[01:31] <cfhowlett> fbc_, and you're installing 12.4.2 the LTS release?
[01:31] <fbc_> cfhowlett, Iwas tryign 12.10, but I'll do whatever realse that works.

[01:33] <cfhowlett> Gavilan3, err, ok ... xfce/lxde mimic ubuntu to an extent
[01:34] <Gavilan3> I meant having a taskbar, a start menu on the bottom

[01:39] <plaidcounty> is there a specific channel for wifi problems on 12.10?

[01:41] <reverendp> How can I uninstall the steam launcher from the command line
[01:42] <cfhowlett> reverendp, depends on how it was installed ...  try       sudo apt-get purge steam
[01:42] <plaidcounty> my problem with my wifi is that it seems to stay connected according to the notification however nothing will connect.
[01:42] <cfhowlett> plaidcounty, are you also running a wired connection?
[01:42] <plaidcounty> Only way I've been able to keep a steady connection is to keep a constant ping going in a terminal
[01:43] <plaidcounty> negative. I've in IRC on my android tablet right now.
[01:43] <cfhowlett> plaidcounty, in  a terminal:   ping www.ubuntu.com

[01:45] <plaidcounty> yes
[01:45] <reverendp> cfhowlett hmm it says its not installed.  I installed it from terminal and it kept crashing.  I think I might have installed the 64 version.

[01:46] <hfswhere> ubuntu 11.10 live cd
[01:47] <reverendp> cfhowlett i've tried remove also and still not installed but the launcher is.  The USC won't let me install the 32 till I remove the launcher
[01:47] <cfhowlett> plaidcounty, my wifi experience is on Broadcom and I'm happy to say that's gotten a WHOLE lot easier over the years.  No working knowledge of realtek, but I would suspect fully updating your system and then rebuilding the driver should fix it.
[01:48] <cfhowlett> reverendp, HOW exactly did you install?  Ubuntu software center or a different method?
[01:48] <reverendp> cfhowlett no I used the terminal to install it
[01:49] <cfhowlett> reverendp, apt-get steam.deb or dpkg -i?
[01:49] <plaidcounty> cfhowlett: I was hoping the same, however I've reinstalled entire system twice with no luck and with two different wifi usb adapters. Other was linksys ae2500 (ndiswrapper from xp on 32bit for that one.)
[01:50] <fat> where is the terminal's image file path (the black board)?
[01:50] <cfhowlett> plaidcounty, try a different hotspot and see if the problem persists.  If yes, your driver/hardware is suspect.  If no, your current hotspot might have some routing/settings that are futzing your connection.
[01:50] <reverendp> cfhowlett, I think dppkg -i
[01:51] <k1l> fat: you can change that in the settings
[01:51] <cfhowlett> reverendp, ahhh, well then.  sudo dpkg -r is what you want
[01:51] <fat> k1l: i dont wnat to change it. i just want to find it

[01:54] <k1l> fat: /usr/share/icons ?
[01:54] <cfhowlett> !ot|yown would be good for that, but of course, favorably biased toward ubuntu
[01:54] <ubottu> yown would be good for that, but of course, favorably biased toward ubuntu: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!

[02:15] <rurufufuss> mgolisch: no idea, I did put in another 16GB of ram onto the CPU
[02:15] <cfhowlett> k1l, you funny!
[02:15] <rurufufuss> to 24GB now
[02:15] <usr13> nezZario: Never mind, it was not a relevant question.  Sorry.
[02:16] <mgolisch> rurufufuss: no more like suspending the channel because of no activity or such
[02:16] <plaidcounty> cfhowlett: thanks. kind of thought that's where this was going :) Wish me luck!
[02:16] <mgolisch> rurufufuss: is this a laptop? did you suspend it by any chance?
[02:16] <rurufufuss> mgolisch: oh, I did suspend the computer
[02:16] <cfhowlett> plaidcounty, best of luck!
[02:16]  * k1l funny?
[02:16] <mgolisch> rurufufuss: that is it then
[02:16] <rurufufuss> the cause of the slow speeds you mean?
[02:17] <rurufufuss> or the SATA link down
[02:17] <cfhowlett> ki1 ... "as a server admin ..."
[02:17] <mgolisch> rurufufuss: the links going down and up
[02:17] <rurufufuss> ah right
[02:17] <mgolisch> rurufufuss: might be related to the bad speed too
[02:17] <mgolisch> rurufufuss: id just try rebooting
[02:17] <rurufufuss> well, the bad speed happens when I reboot too I think
[02:17] <mgolisch> but it usualy shouldnt cause problems like that
[02:18] <rurufufuss> okay, gonna try reboot once more
[02:18] <rurufufuss> thanks for being helpful btw
[02:18] <saloomi2012> How to add the Terminal in startup application prefrences?
[02:19] <gman529> Hey everyone
[02:19] <cfhowlett> gman529, greetings
[02:19] <gman529> I am having some trouble with ubuntu 12.04 that I just can't figure out
[02:19] <escott> saloomi2012, run gnome-session-properties and add your terminal there
[02:19] <jasunto> this is like watching paint dry
[02:19] <nezZario> ok, yeah, i can't even find a single tutorial on how to upgrade debian without the use of gui and packages I don't even have .. :)
[02:20] <saloomi2012> i know escott but where is the terminal located? to i just drag it?
[02:20] <nezZario> i'm just going to change the apt source.list and do what I said, .. can't hurt
[02:20] <escott> saloomi2012, type "which gnome-terminal"
=== Emmanuel_Chanel_ is now known as Emmanuel_Chanel
[02:20] <escott> saloomi2012, and it will give you the full path
[02:20] <gman529> Anyone have any idea what would cause the mouse to stop working on the desktop landscape, but work on the unity and title bars
[02:20] <gman529> right click and left click don't work
[02:21] <cfhowlett> nezZario, before you do all that?  might want to check in #ubuntu-server
[02:21] <gman529> also, they don't work on the any programs opened up
[02:21] <gman529> I have googled and googled and I can't find shit
[02:22] <k1l> nezZario: this isnt debian support.
[02:22] <escott> gman529, nautilus isn't running or isn't drawing the desktop
[02:22] <saloomi2012> escott to test that  do i relog ?
[02:22] <Foxhoundz> How do I disable the suggested apps adware Ubuntu installs on my OS by default?
[02:23] <krkelly> is there anyone who could help me with some openvpn issues?
[02:23] <escott> gman529, if its not working in any applications but working for dragging windows then compiz is bugging out
[02:23] <cfhowlett> !lens|Foxhoundz,
[02:23] <gman529> hmm
[02:23] <Foxhoundz> cfhowlett: ?
[02:23] <gman529> what is really odd is this is a fresh install
[02:24] <cfhowlett> Foxhoundz, you want to disable amazon lens.  thought there was a factoid ..
[02:24] <rurufufuss> hmm, the slow copying speed is still there :(
[02:24] <gman529> and it works in the ubuntu test desktop
[02:25] <trism> !adlens | Foxhoundz
[02:25] <ubottu> Foxhoundz: If you wish not to see "More Suggestions" from places like Amazon in your Ubuntu 12.10, simply remove the package unity-lens-shopping, or adjust your Privacy settings as shown here: http://goo.gl/kFO4u . Mark Shuttleworth's blog entry on this is at http://goo.gl/uF7zZ
[02:26] <cfhowlett> gman529, different drivers are active on live boot if I'm not mistaken.  some kind of generic "mouse driver"
[02:26] <cfhowlett> trism, thanks.
[02:26] <nezZario> k1l: wouldn't that be like saying you can't ask about tcip because this isn't bsd support ?
[02:26] <ikla> does unity work well with dual monitors?
[02:26] <cfhowlett> Foxhoundz, or logout, choose a different Desktop Environment and log in.
[02:26] <DJHenjin_> rsync is faster and more efficient than scp ove ssh via CLI right?
[02:26] <k1l> nezZario: cmon
[02:26] <cfhowlett> nezZario, regardless this ain
[02:27] <cfhowlett> aint' debian support.
[02:27] <gman529> cfhowlett, so all I would need to do is change xorg.conf and set the file to use the generic driver
[02:27] <krkelly> is there anyone who could help me with some openvpn issues?
[02:27] <k1l> nezZario: the upgrade process differs alot between debian and ubuntu. so ask the specific support
[02:27] <cfhowlett> gman529, eloquent.  start there
[02:28] <usr13> !topic | nezZario
[02:28] <ubottu> nezZario: Please read the channel topic whenever you enter, as it contains important information. To view it at any time after joining, simply type /topic
[02:28] <gman529> cfhowlet, I know linux, but this new ubuntu is really different and I haven't kept up
[02:28] <cfhowlett> gman529, no worries.  we're ALL learning.
[02:28] <gman529> cfhowlet, Thanks for the info thought.
[02:29] <ikla> does unity work well with dual monitors?
[02:29] <gman529> ikla, yes if you can get it working
[02:29] <Tex_Nick> 21.10 gnome classic de ... i recently added a second monitor, no problems ... when i reboot, only the monitor without my panels is active ... the kludge i've come up with is to right-click on desktop & choose "change desktop background" then click the "all settings" tab & then Displays ... i then check "mirror displays" & apply ... the inactive monitor becomes active ... i then uncheck "mirror displays" and the second monitor remains ac
[02:29] <Tex_Nick> tive ... i've googled and not found anything quite like this ... couls someone provide a more elegant solution ;-)
[02:29] <k1l> gman529: there is no old desktop in unoty
[02:29] <k1l> *unity
[02:29] <mgolisch> rurufufuss: hm has it ever been faster?
[02:29] <fbc_> cfhowlett, I think I figured this out. I'm supposed to be using the amd64+mac images
[02:29] <k1l> gman529: so you cant place dektop icons on your desktop etc. (by default)
[02:30] <ikla> gman529, I thought ubuntu didn't require me to get things working
[02:30] <cfhowlett> fbc_, dern details!
[02:30] <rurufufuss> mgolisch: yeah, after 12.10 for like one day, then I installed new rams, then it's super slow now
[02:30] <cfhowlett> fbc_, but I should have asked ...
[02:30] <gman529> ikla, the dual monitors does require some settings adjustment and possible driver selection
[02:30] <rurufufuss> mgolisch: but then the ramdrive speed is super fast, so it can't be ram issue can it?
[02:31] <gman529> ikla, but that has been something with linux for awhile
[02:31] <ikla> once agazin I thought ubuntu licked your butt and did it all for you :)
[02:31] <nearst> rurufufuss, http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/check-ram-in-ubuntu/ :D
[02:31] <ikla> I'll try it out and see
[02:31] <gman529> k1l, but I could right click on desktop landscape on the test desktop and i get the menu
[02:31] <tcstar> So, it seems as though thunderbird doesn't allow for custom servers for mail.. it wants either imap. or pop3. in the URL which I don't have on my server...  So, what's an alternative email client that's decent to run?
[02:31] <gman529> k1l, once it's installed I get nothing
[02:32] <nearst> tcstar, im use claw-mail or mutt.
[02:32] <k1l> gman529: afaik its the regular behaviour in unity. i think you can set the oldschool behaviour anywhere but i dont know where
[02:33] <k1l> gman529: i cant click on my desktop too
[02:33] <rurufufuss> nearst: 24202 total mem, I'm assuming megabytes?
[02:33] <rurufufuss> and around 23 gigs free
[02:33] <Mathnerd314> so, I'm trying to use redshift with my Proview PLW2230WDBi. The main thing I'd like is a brightness control. Apparently DDCcontrol has been abandoned for many years. Is there a replacement? There's something called /sys/class/backlight but I don't see anything there.
[02:33] <nezZario> nope prolly kilobytes
[02:33] <gman529> can you click inside of programs
[02:33] <nearst> rurufufuss, aw. chipset mobo ? or some kernel modules then
[02:33] <k1l> gman529: yes
[02:34] <tcstar> nearst -- thanks -- i'll take a look at those too..  installing Evolution right now
[02:34] <escott> rurufufuss, you installed additional ram and your machine got slower?
[02:34] <rurufufuss> nearst: hmm, it's an asrock h77, if that makes a difference. I might try removing the two new rams and see if this helps with anything
[02:34] <gman529> k1l, I can't actually interact with programs with my mouse
[02:34] <rurufufuss> escott: well, now that I think about it, yeah
[02:34] <gman529> at all
[02:34] <escott> rurufufuss, if that is the case can you run "dmesg | head -n 200" and paste it to paste.ubuntu.com
[02:34] <gman529> except highlight
[02:34] <rurufufuss> escott: doing that now
[02:35] <k1l> gman529: ahh. ok. i missread that you only couldnt click on the desktop (wallpaper)
[02:35] <rurufufuss> escott: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5560432/
[02:35] <escott> k1l, yeah i read it the same way at first
[02:36] <gman529> k1l: I'm going to try and set it back to the generic driver in the xorg.conf
[02:36] <gman529> I really hate compiz and unity
[02:36] <gman529> if the make it so difficult to work with
[02:36] <escott> rurufufuss, looks like you may have an MTRR issue
[02:37] <gman529> for example my desktop just locked and I can't click on the unlock button
[02:37] <rurufufuss> escott: is that something solvable by googling, or do I need new hardware :(
[02:37] <nearst> MTRR default type: uncachable
[02:38] <rurufufuss> so I have to go to bios and do stuff?
[02:38] <escott> rurufufuss, im not too familiar with them except that you can have issues with them. check beyond line 200 of dmesg to see if the kernel eventually finds a suitable way to program it, but usually the kernel won't struggle to find an MTRR program
[02:39] <escott> rurufufuss, you might also check for a bios update or ask in a channel like ##hardware
[02:39] <nearst> mtrr cleanup actually
[02:39] <rurufufuss> ah, hmm
[02:40] <escott> rurufufuss, also are you running 64bit? i cant tell from that dmesg
[02:40] <rurufufuss> escott: 32bit
[02:40] <escott> rurufufuss, it looks like you are running 32bit in which case i would suggest reinstalling a 64bit version
[02:41] <rurufufuss> escott: I have to use 32bit, this linux box is solely used to compiling simulated iphone apps on opengl :/
[02:41] <krkelly_> can someone help with openvpn on ubuntu?
[02:42] <escott> rurufufuss, and why can't you do that from 64bit?
[02:42] <nearst> maybe kernel reallocation.
[02:42] <rurufufuss> escott: well, I'll have to install the 32 bit libraries and stuff, seems like a lot more hassle
=== krkelly_ is now known as krkelly
[02:43] <rurufufuss> I'm gonna try removing the two new rams first and see if that's truly the case though
[02:44] <nearst> how much ram slot u have atm :D
[02:44] <escott> he already left. i was going to ask him the same
[02:44] <escott> oh well
[02:45] <gman529> where is ubuntu's xorg.conf
[02:45] <nearst> ive dont another spare for ram putting ram now. hehe
[02:45] <cfhowlett> gman529, in terminal:  locate xorg.conf
[02:45] <escott> gman529, it wont have one by default
[02:45] <gman529> the one in /etc/X11/ doesn't have anything
[02:45] <gman529> i did the locate xorg.conf
[02:46] <nearst> new amd driver 13.1 not yet being support on xorg 1.13?
[02:48] <DJHenjin_> iknonia, its Hunterdouglas here from earlier, you around?
[02:50] <rurufufuss> hmm, after removing one of the rams, and starting up, I quickly tried to copy a file and it was faster, though still slow
[02:50] <escott> rurufufuss, what are your stick sizes and what slots are they in
[02:50] <rurufufuss> now the ram's in slot #1 and #3, but now copying 2 gigs to the memory  is going at 6.50 M/s
[02:50] <escott> rurufufuss, and what version of DDR is this
[02:51] <rurufufuss> DDR3, 8GB stick, at slots #1 and #3 now
[02:51] <rurufufuss> it was slots #1, #2 and #3 (out of 4 possible slots before)
[02:51] <escott> rurufufuss, and before it was?
[02:51] <nearst> same model? or mix from any different freq?
[02:51] <DJHenjin_> hmm, for some reason when i do service vsftpd restart  it tells me unknown process then apf start running
[02:51] <rurufufuss> before it was at 1.31M/s
[02:52] <rurufufuss> escott: I'm gonna try go back to the 1 stick of ram, and see how it goes
[02:52] <escott> rurufufuss, i cant remember all the DDR slot matching rules, but having 3/4 slots full is decidedly odd
[02:52] <rurufufuss> escott: well, the 4th one was dead on arrival, and I'm gonna return it today
[02:52] <rurufufuss> just got it yesterday
[02:53] <escott> rurufufuss, 6.5MB/s is along the lines of DDR3-800
[02:53] <rurufufuss> ok, looks like copying 2 gigs of things is stuck at 6.5ghz
[02:53] <rurufufuss> 6.5mb/s sorry
[02:53] <rurufufuss> actually shouldn't ram be way faster than that?
[02:53] <escott> rurufufuss, sorry misreading the table
[02:53] <escott> rurufufuss, off by a factor of 100
[02:53] <escott> :)
[02:54] <rurufufuss> yeah, it's pretty slow aye
[02:54] <rurufufuss> well, I'mm gonna try again and see
[02:54] <escott> rurufufuss, i would worry that you did something that makes these unmatched in a way that is causing problems for theOS
[02:55] <DJHenjin_> for some reason VSFTPD is not running, i am not seeing any errors when i run service vsftpd start  but it refuses to run
[02:55] <nearst> try with default setting in bios and run in single mode
[02:56] <mgolisch> DJHenjin_: checked its logfile?
[02:56] <DJHenjin_> mgolisch:  not entirely sure where to look, /var/log/vsftpd.log ?
[02:57] <tcstar> just found out my issue with my email is that my server (or something) is blocking me on port 25 (as i can't telnet to it)
[02:57] <mgolisch> DJHenjin_: probably i dont have that installed
[02:57] <szx> why does ubuntu not remember mouse pointer speed in settings?
[02:57] <DJHenjin_> isnt there, hmm
[02:58] <rurufufuss> yeah, it was definitely the extra ram
[02:58] <rurufufuss> :(
[02:58] <mgolisch> DJHenjin_: you run that service thing using sudo?
[02:58] <escott> rurufufuss, you've done something to break the matching of the ram
[02:58] <rurufufuss> escott: it's the same ram though, I think
[02:59] <escott> rurufufuss, its always just easier to buy matched products and use them matched
[02:59] <nearst> maybe ram freq u install
[02:59] <leptone> hello trying to set up rotate cube on 12.04. each time i press Ctrl+Alt+Down my system crashes and i have to reboot. whats going on?
[02:59] <DJHenjin_> mgolisch:  yes i did run it as sudo
[02:59] <rurufufuss> nearst: is that a command?
[02:59] <nearst> rurufufuss, eh.. no.. im mean your ram Mhz installed
