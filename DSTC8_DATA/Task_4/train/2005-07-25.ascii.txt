[08:44] <IIIEars> my 2 cents doesn't have any mark up value....
[08:44] <hondje> I suppose I do stupid stuff like writing memos and going to meetings, too
[08:44] <bob2> aleksi_: I hear the o'reilly book is pretty good
[08:44] <Ghetek> bob2 thanks
[08:44] <hondje> Yes, I get paid to make pictures
[08:44] <Razor-X> O' Reilly makes good books
[08:44] <tanki> but you have to admit some of microsoft's licensing does more to advocate an alternative like linux than most loyal geeks, especially for small to medium sized businesses who can't afford it
[08:44] <Razor-X> the best for Linux things, IMO
[08:44] <gijosh> Silly question here.  But, how do you delete a director.  I know rm does files...

[08:44] <ubuntudriftfast1> bob2 will linux make the crossover to ibm easy, or is it going to be like starting from scratch?
[08:44] <Dr_Willis> rm can do that as well. :P
[08:45] <hondje> crossing over to IBM what?
[08:45] <hondje> AIX?
[08:45] <ubuntudriftfast1> yea
[08:45] <bob2> ubuntudriftfast1: how do you mean?  AIX?

[08:45] <gijosh> Dr_Willis Thanks man
[08:45] <Trackilizer> cause he had to look for all his apps online
[08:45] <holycow> that would REALLY make open source a very attractive proposition

[08:49] <desrt> Dr_Willis; oo.  that's nice.
[08:49] <hondje> IIIEars: lots of cheap distributed clients, and tons of presearching
[08:49] <bob2> ubuntudriftfast1: differences between kernels are not huge between distros

[09:04] <Burgundavia> Trackilizer, Breezy will have a clear upgrade path without a reinstall or needing to download a cd (ala FC)
[09:04] <Trackilizer> cool!
[09:04] <floo> can anyone help with a usb printing problem?
[09:04] <thechitowncubs> So is everyone excited about Breezy :)?
[09:04] <hondje> I am
[09:04] <hondje> lots of neat stuff in gnome 2.12
[09:04] <Trackilizer> when is it coming?
[09:04] <bob2> thechitowncubs: if people really want it, they can configure firefox to install .debs when they click on them.  but it's a bad bad idea.
[09:04] <hondje> october
[09:04] <ColonelKernel> nicedreams, I cannot guarantee this will work, but try out "grub-install -recheck /dev/hda"

[09:05] <hacked`> maybe i'll buy a ubuntu stuffed animal so i can use as a piata

[09:07] <Dr_Willis> floo for my hp1012v  - i had to manually start the hpdoj service i THINK...  i got rid of it a few mo ago...
[09:07] <nicedreams> ColonelKernel: It says /sbin/grub-install: line 389: /dev/null: Permission denied.    I am in Knoppix and I mounted /dev/hdc1 and then 'chroot /mnt/hdc1'   Is that all I need to do to change root to do this?
[09:07] <floo> hpdoj???
[09:07] <Dr_Willis> floo,  there was some service that set the device up and did some other twiddling.. i forget its name. :(

[09:08] <ColonelKernel> and I think you can do linux rescue off of the ubuntu cd - or maybe thats just a fedora thing
[09:08] <Burgundavia> ColonelKernel, you can
[09:08] <ColonelKernel> tanki, yeah i got loads 'o friends overseas
[09:08] <thechitowncubs> tanki: I don't have insomnia, a good book kept me up tonight, and i'd thought i'd get involved more with ubuntu while im up

[09:37] <hacked`> why the hell not
[09:37] <desrt> hacked`; and can't from the normal installer
[09:37] <nekohayo> or that's just a future measure
[09:37] <desrt> hacked`; you use your normal user password + sudo
[09:37] <hacked`> i dont want to use sudo
[09:37] <hacked`> i want to be logged in as root
[09:37] <chakri> is there any default movie player for ubuntu

[09:47] <Burgundavia> drcode, the Hoary package does not the security updates backported yet
[09:47] <myz> I downloaded the install CD from the web. Everything installed fine, rebooted PC without the CD in, and then it asked for the CD to be put back in to install more packages, but it comes up with a message box stating "non-ubuntu CD" ?

[11:33] <RQ> try wine'ing the setup.exe, maybe? :)
[11:33] <Bitmastro> never used wine... but i think there is a config file in ~/.wine that let you choose what os
[11:34] <Bitmastro> you want

[11:35] <IIIEars> If Wine needs a certain windows file is it logged so you can copy it from the windows install?
[11:35] <synd> why doesnt ubuntu come with gcc by default, just like all other linux distros?
=== yuacht [~zth@82.193.191.4]  has joined #ubuntu
[11:36] <IIIEars> one CD install?
=== ichy [~zaklane1@chello213047083134.7.14.vie.surfer.at]  has left #ubuntu []
[11:36] <Burgundavia> synd, most people don't use it, and it is therefor a security risk
[11:36] <pvanhoof> Seveas, I think it's a user/group setup problem rather than a filesystem permission one
[11:36] <topyli> synd: i don't think many distros install it by default
[11:36] <wrtpeeps> hi
[11:36] <synd> Burgundavia: hows it a security risk?
=== tvoss [~tvoss@p508E0ED6.dip0.t-ipconnect.de]  has joined #ubuntu
[11:37] <pvanhoof> anyway, I added it as a comment (on both hosts)
[11:37] <Burgundavia> synd, any program is a secrity risk
[11:37] <Burgundavia> synd, allows people to compile stuff on your machine
=== jiyuu0 [~jiyuu0@219.95.210.238]  has joined #ubuntu
[11:37] <Burgundavia> synd, and most distros have stopped installing it by default
[11:37] <IIIEars> <<- removes fakeroot AND GCC to reinstall as needed.   lol
[11:37] <topyli> synd: crack into a box, compile a trojan or recompile ls to include a trojan, etc.

[11:55] <tna> hi im a noob and was wondering if ubuntu would be a good newbie linux distro?
[11:56] <Bitmastro> why don't you try the live cd so you judge by yourself?
[11:56] <Bitmastro> i could tell you it'll newbie friendly, but i can be biased
[11:57] <Bitmastro> just my 2 cents
[11:57] <daves> tna: i have been using MDK for @ 2yrs and just moved to ubuntu, apart from the new GUI (using KDE) and getting to learn new qurks of ubuntu i am not doing too badly with it
[11:57] <anacron> tna: i'd say it is
[11:57] <Seveas> tna, Ubuntu is suitable for newbies

[11:58] <poningru> then tried ubuntu on recommendation of friend

[11:58] <poningru> even on a laptop
[11:58] <tna> k cool ty all :)
[11:59] <daves> tna: also find a local lug group in your area, this is only the 2nd time i've really done live chatting and have got some good info.
[11:59] <tna> k brb
