[05:53] <distro-test> im trying fedora 6 couse does both rpm and deb whit yum
[05:53] <GardenHose> resolv.conf is empty over here
[05:54] <chavo> you just apt-get install rpm, now installing rpm files is not supported of course
[05:54] <haxality> the installer works, but when it goes to download the flashplayer it says 'download failed' and aborts
[05:54] <Pennypacker> just use yumex
[05:54] <jron> haxality: just download the installer from the flash site
[05:54] <distro-test> so on ubuntu if u get a rpm u must use terminal and it's not as easy as yum ?

[06:25] <Tonren> thirith_: You can probably just un-comment the lines that include the words "multiverse" and "universe" in /etc/apt/sources.list

[06:26] <Lierodeath> How would I go about installing the "OpenGL libraries" on a newish install of 6.10?
[06:26] <thirith_> sorry
[06:26] <MacLinuxMaster> `Idle` is in python tk interface

[06:26] <blanky> anyone?

How do I stop this?  It looks really stupid, and can't be healthy for my eyes or the screen.
[06:26] <thirith_> Tonren: i want to install the apache but there is not package for it in that link.
[06:27] <EnsignRedshirt> riotkittie: It always a bit to cartoonish for me... but I may eventually switch to it anyway.
[06:27] <Tonren> thirith_: What do you mean by "link"?

[07:08] <Tonren> Judicata: Will that help?  arrenlex said he wasn't using the same driver as me, but he has the same problem.  Arren, what driver *do* you use?
[07:08] <Judicata> millones: switch out to metacity throught the beryl icon, and see if it works.
[07:09] <arrenlex> Tonren: radeon
[07:09] <Tonren> arrenlex: how do I go about doing that?  Also, I don't think I'm doing anything that requires 3D acceleration.
[07:09] <ro_> Tonren, What i want to do is change the fonts like I do in gtk, or mess with some kind of xresource

[07:25] <snide> GUYS how do i check my current os version? by command line i mean
[07:25] <Tonren> christian1222: If it's too big, use rsync instead.  Even if it crashes, you can just run the same command again and it'll pick up where you left off.
[07:25] <QQQ> also the issue seems to be happening when i try to save the file on a fat32 partition

[07:40] <EnsignRedshirt> christian1222: No problem, as long as all is well.  It still seems suprising to me that cp didn't work.  cp is so basic...
[07:40] <lebowski> svfusion, you have a better chance of getting it resolved here
[07:40] <svfusion> Here is a picture if my desktop http://www.rage3d.com/board/showthread.php?t=33879949
[07:40] <christian1222> EnsignRedshirt: lebowski: i had my roommate look at it with his mac, and it said 'MS DOS' under format
[07:40] <svfusion> did you see the picture?
[07:40] <christian1222> EnsignRedshirt: lebowski: does that mean ntfs?
[07:41] <lebowski> svfusion, that's messed up .. you installed the ati binary driver?
[07:41] <svfusion> yes
[07:41] <svfusion> and the FGLRX
[07:41] <Taime1> okay, if i am installing nvidia drivers, do i want the regular one or the beta driver?
[07:41] <lebowski> christian1222, no .. its fat32 .. or probably fat

=== maniezzzzzzzzzzz [n=tamu07@125.160.79.100]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:41] <svfusion> So you don't know what is causing it?
[07:42] <lebowski> svfusion, it would be one of the options that you'd have to disable .. glxinfo shows ATI as vendor?
[07:42] <christian1222> lebowski: well i was able to mount the .iso, so wouldnt that mean that it worked?
[07:42] <EnsignRedshirt> christian1222: That's a good idea... is the file size on your copy what you expect it to be?

[07:43] <dxdemetriou_> anybody knows why is the problem "BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0!", and crash my pc when ndiswrapper works?
[07:43] <lebowski> svfusion, yeah, that's a pain, I tried so many different parameters to aticonfig .. but finally got it to work, when I manually edited xorg.conf

[07:43] <PirateHead> When I plug my camera into my computer using a USB connector, it launches a GUI window to import my pictures, which is great. Unfortunately, the GUI window can only access the device if I configure it to gksudo before launching the GUI; and if I do that, then it imports the pictures as root and I have to chown them. How do I automatically make the device readable by my user before launching...
[07:43] <[set]> how do i install a diff package? i ran a dpkg -i on a .dep file and now everytime i try to install a new dep it says the following has unmet dependencies... not installable try apt-get -f install... how do i get rid of taht and install a package
[07:43] <millones> MacLinuxMaster: yeah i'll need to wait 20 minutes without touch my mouse
[07:43] <PirateHead> ...the GUI?
[07:43] <svfusion> I have spent many weeks tring to figure this out, one guy on the fourms had the exact same problem as me and got it fixed. I did what he said to but it just causes my ubuntu not to boot up
[07:43] <christian1222> EnsignRedshirt: interesting, its only 3.99gb, whereas the one on my linux box says 4.2
[07:44] <svfusion> you mean you have had this problem too?
[07:44] <[set]> what's the opposite of dpkg -i ?
[07:44] <arrenlex> [set] : dpkg -x
[07:44] <[set]> but it wasn't installed thoug... it needs unmet dependencies

[07:46] <Giant_sea_turtle> svfusion: are you using the latest 8.33.6 drivers? i hv a 1300x and its runs fine with them
[07:46] <arrenlex> [set] : Remove that package until you do.
[07:46] <[set]> when i install a new version.. it says thsi program has unmet dependeencies..
[07:46] <[set]> it wasn't installed in the first place..
[07:46] <[set]> so i can't -r

[07:47] <Ayabara> What can I use to do "advanced" renaming of files from a shell? Change case, substitute letters, add/remove prefixes and so on

[07:53] <lebowski> christian1222, unless you split it up or something, but that wouldn't be very useful, unless your friend has a partition that can handle files larger than 4 gigs (ntfs)
[07:53] <christian1222> lebowski: so what would you recommend? could I copy the files seperately? they dont need to be all in an iso to install correct? just in the same directory
[07:53] <esc_ape> can someone do me a favor & send me a message to my gaim (aim account)?
[07:53] <lebowski> christian1222, does your friend have an NTFS volume? what windows is he running?
[07:53] <christian1222> lebowski: if he wanted, could he erase all data from the HD and then reformat in NTFS or FAT-32?
[07:53] <svfusion> lebowski what driver do you recommand?
[07:54] <christian1222> lebowski: hes running Mac OS
[07:54] <oFF-beAt> start up commands in "sessions" which requires root accees.. will not b executed right?
[07:54] <lebowski> vfat is FAT32 .. again .. write support for ntfs, I wouldn't trust completely

[07:56] <svfusion> manually or apt-get
[07:56] <lebowski> christian1222, yes .. ntfs .. but the question is, you cannot gurantee write-reliability if you use anything other that windows to write to it
[07:57] <lebowski> christian1222, but well, its not that terrible
[07:57] <christian1222> lebowski: oh really? what about md5sum?
[07:57] <christian1222> since its an iso
[07:57] <lebowski> christian1222, md5sum? what about it?
[07:57] <EnsignRedshirt> christian1222: They should all be able to *read* ntfs.  I don't know much about the mac writing ntfs, and my knowledge may be out-of-date, but writing ntfs from linux used to be unreliable.

[07:57] <dxdemetriou> when a pc crash, can I find somewere the reason? logs or something?
[07:58] <lebowski> EnsignRedshirt, writing to ntfs from mac and linux is not safe yet
[07:58] <xinted> ntfs3g  works exceptionally well, considering that ms never allowed anyone access their ntfs
[07:58] <nothlit> I find ntfs-3g works fine
[07:58] <lebowski> dxdemetriou, dmesg
[07:58] <MacLinuxMaster> xinted: I really can confirm
[07:58] <christian1222> EnsignRedshirt: ok, thanks guys, i think i am just going to try and put the files from the iso on the drive
[07:58] <lebowski> ntfs3g, that's what I was looking for :D
[07:59] <christian1222> EnsignRedshirt: lebowski: rather than trying to change the FS, would that work to install on windows, if they were all in the same directory, not from the same image?
[07:59] <EnsignRedshirt> christian1222: That seems to be the only option.  Unless you can skip using the drive, and connect your computers via a network.
[07:59] <xinted> so the opensource community has done very well indeed to bring the write access to the whole
[07:59] <mainer> dxdemetriou: /var/log/syslog /var/log/kernel.log /var/logmessages.log ... etc...
