[15:19] <Elfish> is anyone running wubi under windows 7?
[15:19] <actionParsnip> azolap: it means that there are no disks in the system

[15:20] <w83> kjele, is it still in dev phase ?
[15:20] <actionParsnip> azolap: or the controller has died, or the disk IDE has failed

[15:20] <mete> very fast!
[15:20] <actionParsnip> Agent_Smith: you can remove the old linux-images with version numbers to free up space but you must keep linux-image-generic
[15:20] <Assid> wow esata going slow on ubuntu
[15:20] <Assid> i have it on ahci correctly
[15:21] <kjele> w83: The next Ubuntu release is suppose to have it. Currently the one you find in dev version of Ubuntu is breaking a lot of stuff.

[15:22] <Twain_32> delete or no?
[15:22] <doolph> hi
[15:22] <Dr_Willis> Twain_32:  may as well delete it - and see what it controls :)
[15:22] <Wilthril> anyone knows how to change the system sounds? (like the login sound)
[15:22] <Twain_32> thanks
[15:22] <Wilthril> i'd like to put my own custom login sound instead thanks
[15:22] <w83> ok, thx for the response I really appreciate it :)
[15:23] <Dr_Willis> Wilthril:  one way. find the sound, replace it with a different one.
[15:23]  * Dr_Willis turns off the login sound.
[15:23] <Wilthril> that's kinda dirty no? :p
[15:23] <actionParsnip> Agent_Smith: what is the output of:   dpkg -l | grep linux-image
[15:23] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: it seems that synaptic has some problems
[15:23] <Dr_Willis> Wilthril:  as far as i know theres no gui tools to configure the sound themes
[15:24] <actionParsnip> Agent_Smith: ok, whats the output of: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get --reinstall install gedit
[15:24] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: can I paste 4 lines here?
[15:24] <doolph> Wilthril system preference sounds
[15:24] <azolap> actionParsnip .. i had a dual boot windows7/ubuntu set up on my laptop but i damaged the hard disk which meanti couldn't boot either windows or linux. (it would just stall at the loading screen) just now i booted the livecd and ran e2fsck , and when i restarted it says "Operating system not found" .. i don't even get the grub bootloader any more! do you know what might have gone wrong? :(
[15:24] <actionParsnip> Agent_Smith: pastebin dude
[15:24] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: ok
[15:24] <Wilthril> doolph: nope i didn't find in preferences sound
[15:24] <Wilthril> doolph: i want to put my custom sounds (ie I choose which file to play)
[15:24] <actionParsnip> azolap: i'd grab the ultimate boot cd and test the drive using the manufacturer's tool

[15:27] <doolph> Wilthril it should be there
[15:27] <actionParsnip> Agent_Smith: then you have that, you have 2 kernels. There are only the 2 kernels output in the text you pastebinned

[15:28] <|E|Yoshi> Hey, could you help me? I'm new on linux, I need my microphone to be working with Mumble (VoiP), but it doesnt work at all, it works fine on windows, but not on linux
[15:28] <Wilthril> doolph: i can't find where i can put my custom files really
[15:28] <actionParsnip> azolap: sounds like a dead HDD to me
[15:28] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: actually 3
[15:28] <|E|Yoshi> I tried to google it, but couldnt find
[15:28] <actionParsnip> Agent_Smith: line 4 is a metapackage and not a real kernel
[15:28] <Wilthril> it's like "defaut, barking, etc..." but i can't choose a file
[15:28] <azolap> actionParsnip well yes it's messed up.. but does this mean there is no way i can recover my windows 7 user files?? :(
[15:29] <actionParsnip> azolap: restore them from your backups
[15:29] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: ok ... but why I need to keep this metapackage is it's older than my packages?
[15:29] <drizzt_> i had installed pinot but it doesn't index anything, is that because I'm using Gnome?
=== stix_ is now known as stix
[15:29] <arcade> So, I was going to upgrade from 9.10  -> 10.4, but the updater crashed before it managed to start, except that it managed to update the sources .. so kpackagekit is in a strange state.  How do I relaunch the upgrade process ?
[15:30] <azolap> actionParsnip i don't have any backups for half of them.. is there no way i can get them off the drive?
[15:30] <actionParsnip> Agent_Smith: its a harmless metapackage, its required during distribution upgrades as well as installing new kernels later
[15:30] <Dr_Willis> azolap:  try a live cd and see what you can rescue
[15:30] <arcade> update the sources as in /etc/apt/sources.list.  Nothing new installed.
[15:30] <actionParsnip> azolap: if the drive doesn't detect then its a dead duck dude
[15:30] <Phenyl> Hi.
[15:30] <arcade> So, how do I relaunch the updater?
[15:30] <nody> Dr_Willis: ah it' has gnome-mplayer
[15:30] <actionParsnip> azolap: you could try repeated boots until its nice
[15:30] <soreau> arcade: on the cli, use apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade
[15:30] <azolap> oh dear :'(
[15:31] <Dr_Willis> azolap:  theres numerous 'hacks/tricks' that MIGHT restore a drive to functionality for a limited time...    :)
[15:31] <arcade> soreau: oh, that's okay then :P
[15:31] <actionParsnip> azolap: otherwise i'd say you were stumped and your poor backups have bitten you hard
[15:31] <Phenyl> I'm searching a soft like cheese but which handle sound.
[15:31] <sprung> I want to install tor but sudo apt-get install tor doesn't find it. is it under a different package name?
[15:31] <arcade> soreau: not dist-upgrade ?
[15:31] <doolph> Wilthril you have to copy sounds to /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/
[15:31] <azolap> yes
[15:31] <Dr_Willis> nody:  gnome-mplayer is the gui variant of mplayer yes,,
[15:31] <arcade> azolap: What kind of data do you need to rescjue?
[15:31] <drizzt_> does someone usin pinot?
[15:31] <theadmin> sprung: You have to add their repository
[15:31] <nody> Dr_Willis: yea and it lags mplayer doesnt
[15:31] <Dr_Willis> nody:  theres also smplayer and  just mplayer
[15:31] <nody> Dr_Willis: that lags too

[15:32] <sprung> theadmin, it said i don't have deb installed
[15:32] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: the last one is .33 and not .23

=== ruben is now known as Guest4530
[15:33] <boodroscotch> You see, it uses libqt3-mt
[15:33] <arcade> azolap: Okay.  Depending on how broken your disk is, it depends.
[15:33] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: anyway thanks for your help ... I'll keep this package installed
[15:33] <boodroscotch> and libqt3-mt.so.3 specifically
[15:33] <actionParsnip> azolap: you MAY be able to use foremost or dd_rescue to make an image
[15:33] <sprung> theadmin, wow thanks
[15:33] <Dr_Willis> azolap:  you could try to 'ddrescue' the whold drive to another drive as a file image. then recover from that. IF it can even do that.
[15:33] <actionParsnip> Agent_Smith: its not hurting nobody ;)
[15:33] <boodroscotch> so I installed both
[15:34] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: yeap
[15:34] <sllide> my ubuntu netbook remix box has two screens
[15:34] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: thanks a lot
[15:34] <sllide> how can i make the menu only show on the main screen?
[15:34] <boodroscotch> and it still does not recognize that the library is present
[15:34] <arcade> azolap: My initial thought would be "is the disk physically broken" .  If not, get an equally sized disk and do a dd if=/dev/THISDISK of=/path/to/new/disk/olddisk.image
[15:34] <actionParsnip> Agent_Smith: np man, i think its a weird package too tbh
[15:34] <boodroscotch> help please?
[15:34] <arcade> azolap: Don't execute that if you don't know what it does, btw. :P
[15:34] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: so I'm not crazing, right? :D
[15:34] <actionParsnip> arcade: dd will moan if it gets a bad bit of disk dd_rescue just keeps going
[15:35] <arcade> actionParsnip: never had dd moan at me, but you're probably right.
[15:35] <actionParsnip> Agent_Smith: oh god no, we have a kernel with a version number, why do we need a weird extra bit
[15:36] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: I've tried to google something before I came here but I didnt find anything usefull
[15:36] <Assid> is there a way for me to confirm im using 64bit flash
[15:36] <Assid> ?
[15:36] <arcade> azolap: or, it doesn't detect the drive as in .. not even the device?
[15:37] <Agent_Smith> actionParsnip: I have to go ... thanks for your help and patient with me ...lol
[15:37] <azolap> arcade i was going to try something like that (creating an image of the disk) but when i was booted in livecd fdisk -l returned no output, so it couldn't even detect the disk
[15:37] <actionParsnip> Assid:can you give the output of: dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf
[15:37] <Assid> okay i reinstalled gwibber.. but no joy
[15:37] <arcade> azolap: 'dmesg', does dmesg report anything about the disk at all ?
[15:38] <boodroscotch> so, I have a program that does not recognize that a critical shared library; libqt3-mt.so.3, is present. Help Please? WAT DO?
[15:38] <Assid> actionParsnip: sorry.. can you retype that pleas
[15:38] <Assid> i hit clear instead of copy
[15:38] <actionParsnip> Assid: you can also find the plugin .so file and run:   file filename.so    it will state its architecture
[15:38] <arcade> azolap: If you touch the pysical disk, can you feel whether it's spinning?  Oh, and have you verified that it's got power and data cables plugged properly in in both ends? :P
[15:38] <actionParsnip> Assid: dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf
[15:39] <Assid> 64-installer seems installed
[15:39] <actionParsnip> Assid: or you can use: sudo find / -iname "*.so" | grep flash -exec file {} \;     bit cheekier ;)
[15:39] <boodroscotch> also, I'm running 64-bit Lucid
[15:40] <Assid> actionParsnip: that doesnt work..
[15:40] <actionParsnip> boodroscotch: is the app you are running 64bit too?
[15:40] <actionParsnip> Assid: the find command will take a while, it will find all .so files containing the word flash and tell you what arch they are
[15:40] <Assid> actionParsnip: yes i know.. but that command doesnt wanna run
[15:41] <Assid> actionParsnip: okay gwibber doesnt work even after reinstalling
[15:41] <boodroscotch> actionParsnip: I'm pretty sure it isn't; I don't know.
[15:41] <Assid> same output as before
[15:41] <actionParsnip> boodroscotch: what is the output of:  file `which foo`     replace foo with the command you are running
[15:41] <joe_c> Hi all...  Is Xubuntu 10.04 an LTS or regular branch!?
[15:42] <actionParsnip> Assid: sounds like a bug then, use the terminal output as part of the bug
[15:42] <Assid> methinks this is related: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1462433
[15:42] <actionParsnip> joe_c: LTS afaik
[15:42] <joe_c> I see, thanks A! :^)
[15:42] <azolap> arcade i did check the hard disk connections yesterday but the laptop casing isn't removed atm so i can't check right now.. i ran an e2fsck earlier today and it found thousands of bad blocks it couldn't read. i thought it was going to fix them but e2fsck has appeared to ruin the disk even more
[15:42] <liguangliang> sb
[15:42] <boodroscotch> actionParsnip: I'm on windows right now; the software that is causing the error is the 3G driver GUI
[15:43] <arcade> azolap: oh. :-/
[15:43] <sllide> is there something simmilar to ollydbg for linux?
[15:44] <drizzt_> how can i change beagle indexing settings?
[15:44] <e01>  hello, i am turning off the icons from the desktop from gconf-editor desktop->gnome->session->[required components list]

[15:44] <Assid> actionParsnip: so is that bug fixed? cause im still getting it and this is 10.04 stable
[15:45] <actionParsnip> Assid: not sure, log your bug and it will be addressed one way or another or be marked as a duplicate of another bug

=== [SW]Dodge is now known as [SW]Dodge`oFF
[15:48] <azolap> btw arcade i just tried dmesg and yes it reports loads about the disc. stuff like "I/O error dev sda" "Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block xx" etc
[15:49] <arcade> azolap: That sounds bad.  Your main hope seems to be a bad data cable, i.e try to swap the ide/sata/scsi/whatever cable and try again.
[15:49] <arcade> azolap: If it's not the connectors, then .. "shit has happened"
[15:49] <Dr_Willis> 'hit the fan. and the fan was on HIGH'
[15:50] <arcade> Dr_Willis: yes.  basically
[15:50] <arcade> :P
[15:50] <azolap> lol
[15:50] <azolap> yes.. well thanks for the advice anyway
[15:51] <arcade> azolap: Most of the time it's the connections though. :)
[15:51] <arcade> azolap: So don't give up hope juust yet.
[15:51] <arcade> azolap: My RAID-setup used to behave like that.  Problem was that 3 of the disks used to go offline at the same time.  In the end I discovered that I had made a silly power-setup with 1 disk being powered from one cable from the PSU, while the second cable ending up with 5 splits. :P
[15:52] <azolap> hmm ok i'll try it in another pc i think, if i can figure out how to get my hd out of my laptop
[15:52] <arcade> azolap: Something that quite simply wasn't enough for the poor disks.  When I "rebalanced" the splits, all disks were running nicely.  Quite simply a power problem - and no data was lost
[15:52] <arcade> azolap: You might even want to just pull the disk out and slide in back into the same laptop
[15:54] <azolap> oh right arcade, well i hope it is that simple for me. but e2fsck already made a load of changes and i seem to have lost my grub bootloader so even if it was a connection it probably messed up the hd anyway?
[15:54] <actionParsnip> azolap: if you do get it back online. BACKUP your stuff
[15:55] <arcade> azolap: I'm surprised that e2fsck would touch anything outside a single extX filesystem.
[15:55] <ubuntunewbie> Hi anyone can teach me how to list files includes timestamp with second ? ls command ?
[15:55] <azolap> yes i will back up if i do
[15:55] <ubuntunewbie> Thank you very much :-)
[15:55] <arcade> ubuntunewbie: ls -la
[15:55] <nody> Dr_Willis: vlc runs smooth yea
[15:55] <azolap> arcade yes i only ran e2fsck on the linux partition , but it seems to have messed up a lot more than that
[15:55] <nody> Dr_Willis: but it's lagging too :D
[15:55] <arcade> ubuntunewbie: oh, timestamp with second?  use 'stat' on the files.
[15:55] <actionParsnip> azolap: then keep a good backup. if it really dies then you don't care
[15:56] <Dr_Willis> nody:  could be your video is encoded badly.
[15:56] <arcade> azolap: That is rather strange.  e2fsck should only work on a single partition.
[15:56] <ubuntunewbie> arcade : ? I tried with ls but it only show until min , not second since I wanted to list all files
[15:56] <ubuntunewbie> arcade : stat ??
[15:56] <arcade> azolap: Hm, I don't remember exactly how GRUB works though.  It of course uses the bootsector, but where does it load the rest of the info from?   That I do not remember.
[15:57] <arcade> ubuntunewbie: ls --full-time -la
[15:57] <Appl6> arcade: It has enough knowledge of filesystems to traverse the root and find later stages in /boot/grub in the particular partition it was installed from.
[15:57] <arcade> ubuntunewbie: You should also try 'man ls' to figure out the other options to ls
[15:58] <ubuntunewbie> arcade : ok trying to read
[15:58] <arcade> azolap / Appl6 : So in other words, grub can have been hosed by e2fsck running on the linux partition only, since the grub files was located on the linux partition.
[15:58] <azolap> ah yes i see
[15:58] <arcade> azolap: in that case, your windows stuff might still be entirely safe.
[15:59] <azolap> hm ok, but then why does it say SMART failure predicted every time i turn on now
[15:59] <arcade> azolap: You just need to create yourself a new boot sector, and not fiddle with the windows partition itself.
[15:59] <azolap> that doesn't sound like everything's safe
[15:59] <arcade> azolap: All your data should thus be entirely nice and safe. :P
[15:59] <azolap> it says a failure is imminent :x
[15:59] <arcade> azolap: Oh, certainly.
[15:59] <EmoSpice> azolap: You should probably buy a new hdd
[15:59] <arcade> azolap: But your windows partition isn't destroyed by e2fsck. :)
[15:59] <azolap> EmoSpice yes i plan on doing that, but i really want to get my data back if i can
[15:59] <azolap> from windwos
[15:59] <EmoSpice> ah
[16:00] <arcade> azolap: So, where in the world are you located?
[16:00] <Daekdroom> azolap, You're probably better off buying a new HDD and only running the old one when you're actually going to transfer the files.

[16:01] <ubuntunewbie> arcade : want to ask , I dont quite understand the "-a" means -a, --all    "do not ignore entries starting with ." ? what does it mean do not ignore start with (what) ?
[16:02] <azolap> Daekdroom but how am i going to get to the files to copy them, the drive doesn't seem to be recognised any more :s arcade hmm ok.. well i'll try to find someone who can if i get no where over the bank holiday weekend
[16:02] <Assid> iu have a 1TB internal it just doesnt wanna detect right
[16:02] <EmoSpice> ubuntunewbie: hidden files in a linux system start with a . (a period)
[16:02] <arcade> ubuntunewbie: "ls" by default ignores listing files that start with a dot (".") .
[16:02] <Assid> in disk utility it doesnt even show my partitions
[16:02] <Colonel-Rosa> morning
[16:02] <Daekdroom> azolap, ah, that definitely makes it require a proper help in the area.
[16:02] <arcade> ubuntunewbie: The '-a' option makes sure to show these "hidden" files.  it's a convention for hiding files that you don't want to see normally.  Typically config files.
[16:02]  * Assid is starting to freak out
[16:02] <BluesKaj> Assid, how about gparted
[16:03] <ubuntunewbie> arcade : oh , thanks ;-)
[16:03] <LjL> azolap, seriously, the thing to do is to take an image of the drive. then later you can use plenty of tools that at least attempt a recovery of your files
[16:03] <EmoSpice> Assid: cfdisk? fdisk? parted?
[16:03] <Assid> so far the move to ubuntu has been a whole lot of loss of data
[16:03] <Assid> hold on waiting for gparted
[16:03] <azolap> LjL i was just about to take an image of the hard disk like you said earlier.. but after e2fsck fniished running the disk was no longer recognised.. i couldn't see my windows/linux partition any more
[16:03] <LjL> azolap: :(
[16:04] <LjL> azolap: i told you to use the disk as little as possible before imaging it :| every time you use it, it risks getting worse, and it probably has
[16:04] <EmoSpice> azolap: that's not e2fsck's fault - it's probably just the harddrivefailing more and more.
[16:04] <azolap> well yes i was going to do it straight away, but e2fsck was like 80% done so i waited for it to end :/
[16:05] <EmoSpice> and since e2fsck runs over every sector, it's likely to have thrashed more of the drive
[16:05] <frxstrem> is there a program that would allow me to simulate a keypress?
[16:05] <arcade>  Uhm
[16:05] <azolap> oh that does't sound good
[16:05] <arcade> Guys
[16:05] <EmoSpice> frxstrem: xdo? I think it's called?
[16:05] <arcade> Just because SMART shows some errors doesn't mean that the drive is that destroyed yet.  It might be, but let's not just jump to conclusions.
[16:05] <arcade> :)
[16:06] <arcade> azolap: My recommendation - just switch it off, find your friendly local linux guru to have a look at it for you.
[16:06] <Assid> damn it says unallocated?!?!?!?
[16:06] <LjL> fxhp: xmacro, xdotool
[16:06] <Assid> wtf just happened to my data
[16:07]  * Assid thinks he should move back to win7
[16:07] <frxstrem> EmoSpice: i can't find it...neither in Ubuntu nor in the repositories
[16:07] <EmoSpice> Assid: did you just do an install?
[16:07] <Assid> EmoSpice: yes
[16:07] <EmoSpice> frxstrem: I told you wrong - I'm looking for the name now
[16:07] <Assid> fresh install maybe a couple of hours back
[16:07] <EmoSpice> Assid: did you do the 'default' install?
[16:07] <Assid> nah.. i chose the drive i want and made my own partitions
[16:08] <Assid> EmoSpice: not my first time on linux. and ubuntu for that matter
[16:08] <EmoSpice> Not saying it is - I'm simply covering bases :)
[16:08] <EmoSpice> are you sure you've chosen the right drives in all of the partitioning software you've used?
[16:08] <BluesKaj> Assid,is the partition in question ntfs ?
=== rul is now known as xRuL
[16:08] <Assid> BluesKaj: yes bu the otther ntfs partitions work fine
[16:09] <EmoSpice> frxstrem: you're looking for a program, and not a code example, right?
[16:09] <Assid> i didnt even touch that drive
[16:10] <frxstrem> EmoSpice: yes
[16:10] <Assid> i was too busy trying to get all the updates and softwares i need installed
[16:10]  * Assid throws an angry fit
[16:10] <EmoSpice> frxstrem: try xevent?
[16:10] <BluesKaj> Assid, is it a separate drive , or a partition ?

[16:12] <itheos> how to mount a partition which isnt visible?
[16:12] <BluesKaj> Assid, you need to mount that drive , but I would check in another OS first to make sure it's read/writeable
[16:12] <arcade> rocket16: What priority?
[16:13] <rocket16> EmoSpice: Thanks, :)
[16:13] <frxstrem> EmoSpice: okay.......well, it seems to be what I'm looking for, so thanks for your help :)
[16:13] <rocket16> arcade: The priority of the process Pidgin in System-monitor.
[16:13] <itheos> arcade, i tried the mount command but it says "mount: special device /dev/sdc1 does not exist"
[16:13] <EmoSpice> (both): You're welcome.
[16:13] <EmoSpice> frxstrem: even if not, it shouldn't be hard to compile.
[16:14] <frxstrem> EmoSpice: I know - but I cannot seem to get it to work, though (with checkinstall)
[16:14] <theadmin> Is running nice apps having any potential to cause slowdowns? (nice means those ran with "nice" command, of course)
[16:14] <arcade> rocket16: What priority?  Reducing the priority doesn't make it use less RAM.  In any case, the command (from the command line) is 'renice'.
[16:14] <itheos> i have a seagate external hdd. i want to mount it. but i am root and its not detecting it. what to do?
[16:14] <marienz> theadmin: depends.
[16:15] <EmoSpice> frxstrem: you'd be better off asking someone else about debian / ubuntu specific package management. As I said - I'm primarily an Arch / FreeBSD user
[16:15] <rocket16> arcade: Well, thanks. But I just meant the shared memory there, and it is affected by the Nice Value from System Monitor GUI.
[16:15] <marienz> theadmin: a niced app can still cause an unniced app to do work (common example: the X server), and they can still do a lot of disk io or consume some other kind of resource.
[16:15] <theadmin> marienz: Well, in my case Firefox eats a lot of memory and i want to "nice" it so it is less hungry
[16:15] <marienz> theadmin: nice will not affect memory usage at all.
[16:15] <theadmin> marienz: Oh?... bleh :/
[16:15] <Slart> theadmin: sure.. nice just takes care of the cpu.. if your app uses a lot of bandwidth somewhere (pci, network) it can still cause things to slow down
[16:16] <theadmin> Slart: Well it's not the bandwith, it just is hungry with RAM
[16:16] <Slart> theadmin: there's even an "ionice"
[16:16] <theadmin> Slart: I have nothing against it using bandwith lolz
[16:17] <EmoSpice> theadmin: you may want to just use a separate program, if you can. Renicing is just going to change it's processing priority and not change much for the RAM usage, if I understand things right. (I could be way off base, though)
[16:17] <theadmin> Well anyway. If I put "gnome-shell --replace" in my .profile will that work normally?
[16:17] <Slart> theadmin: well.. if it uses RAM a lot it might still slow other things down.. if it's noticable or not would depend on the system and the app, I would guess
[16:17] <EmoSpice> theadmin: what networks do you use?
[16:17] <theadmin> EmoSpice: Networks as in...?
[16:18] <theadmin> EmoSpice: If I got it right, eth0
[16:18] <EmoSpice> theadmin: MSN/ AIM?
[16:18] <theadmin> EmoSpice: Oh... uhm. I do use MSN, Gtalk/XMPP/Jabber and ICQ
[16:18] <theadmin> EmoSpice: But I don't see how this can cause problems
[16:18] <frxstrem> I tried to compile xevent from source, but 'make' gave me an error message (http://pastebin.com/WwPqHEjX) - does someone know why it won't compile?
[16:18] <raul__> Can I use the openshot to export a video to a .wmv format??
[16:19] <EmoSpice> it doesn't - I was going to suggest using jabber and utilising their transports. Pidgin is RAM hungry anyway - and like I said I don't believe that renicing it is going to help
[16:19] <xangua> theadmin: what version are you using <unconvertable> i see no problems with latest pidgin 2.7
[16:19] <theadmin> raul__: Doubt it very much (just the name has "open" in it and wmv is propertiary)
[16:19] <theadmin> xangua: Uhm, I have no idea where on earth the dude got an idea I have pidgin problems. I was asking about Firefox.
[16:19] <itheos> i have a seagate external hdd. i want to mount it. but i am root and its not detecting it. what to do?
[16:20] <raul__> theadmin is there any software that changes a video format to .wmv?

[17:03] <arcade> llutz: Sure there is, but I wonder how on earth I should figure out what "modem-manager" does when it doesn't even ship with a bloody manpage. :P
[17:04] <llutz> arcade: true but not necessarily *buntus fault
[17:04] <arcade> llutz: Of course it is.
[17:04] <bradpitt> soreau, can you take a look at this screenshot? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2075532/UBUNTU/Ubuntu%20Screenshot/LXDE2.png metacity or whatever it's name still like in ubuntu.
[17:04] <llutz> arcade: focus is on people which never will read any documentation :(
[17:05] <arcade> llutz: dumb it down until the early adopters flee to a better distro? :P
[17:05] <arcade> llutz: certainly sounds like a plan.
[17:07] <soreau> bradpitt: What am I supposed to see in this shot?
[17:07] <bradpitt> soreau, buttons it's like in ubuntu
[17:07] <rallias> where is the file that tells the system what to do on boot?
[17:07] <desperate-man> anyone here with sysv startup knowledge?
[17:08] <soreau> bradpitt: You mean the window borders?
[17:08] <arcade> desperate-man: sure, what do you need help with?
[17:08] <bradpitt> soreau, yes
[17:08] <soreau> bradpitt: Try disabling /apps/gwd/use_metacity_theme in gconf-editor
[17:09] <rallias> Where can i find the file that tells the operating system what to do when it boots?
[17:10] <itheos> grub?
[17:10] <bradpitt> soreau, awesome. Merci beaucoup
[17:10] <rallias> no right after grub. I think it was inetd

[17:10] <llutz> rallias: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[17:11] <llutz> rahul_: "init" was replaced by upstart

[17:12] <llutz> rallias: inetd? thats something different
[17:12] <soreau> wise_crypt: If you are using gnome, yes
[17:12] <rallias> whatever. How do i get a wireless connection to connect on boot?

[17:13] <ubuntu_> hi
[17:13] <seanj> hi, i thought sound would be improved in 10.04 release, but sound still lags by a mile with pulseaudio
[17:13] <soreau> wise_crypt: or what effect are you looking for?
=== seanj is now known as Guest4972
[17:14] <rallias> how do i use a command line command to do it?

[17:14] <axon_> i need some help. i want to install win98 in virtualbox. i started virtualbox, i did the setup for a new entry. then i started this entry ... and than i got the error:VBox status code: -1908 (VERR_VM_DRIVER_NOT_INSTALLED).
[17:14] <dtcrshr> hello people, iv installed ubuntu here on my mothers pc, and mostly what she does is to check emails, many of them .pps presentations. But they open much bigger then the real screen size, and got no sound at all... any possible fix?
[17:14] <Ra> Hola!!!
[17:14] <axon_> what do i have to do?
[17:14] <axon_> the cd is in the cd-drive
[17:14] <soreau> wise_crypt: ah yea, that gpu can barely run compiz and its blacklisted because current intel driver just crashes with compiz
=== Guest4972 is now known as node357
[17:14] <wise_crypt> soreau: no easy workaround yet ( all i think is buying new nvidia card )
[17:15] <soreau> wise_crypt: now is the time to choose radeon
[17:15] <node357> hi, how can i stop sound lag with pulseaudio? im trying to play some games and there's at least 10 seconds lag in the sound
[17:15] <wise_crypt> soreau: nice tip
[17:15] <sprung> yeah dont go nvidia for now
[17:15] <ubuntu_> what is the xubuntu default login password?

[17:19] <a3ist> IMTheNachoMan, I'm not sure which ssh bins are in osx but you can always manually generate one and copy it to the authorized keys list on ubuntu if there's no bin for sending keys automatically
[17:19] <node357> welll I guess I'll remove pulseaudio and see if my system still works after

[17:22] <ritimbaks> hey
[17:22] <hiexpo> onetinsoldier, :)
[17:22] <onetinsoldier> :-)
[17:22] <Vexc> Is there a way for me to bump up the refresh rate to over 85Hz? I am using ubuntu Lucid Lynxz with a nVidia Corporation G71 [GeGorce 7950 GT] adapter with a monitor that has a horizontal freq. 30 to 130 kHz and verical freq. 50 to 170 Hz.
[17:22] <wise_crypt> !lubuntu > ubuntu_
[17:22] <ubottu> ubuntu_, please see my private message
[17:22] <hiexpo> is getdeb repos still down
[17:22] <a3ist> ubuntu_ that version of ubuntu uses XFCE instead of gnome, which has lower requirements; and lubuntu will be even lower
[17:23] <a3ist> I use LXDE (but not ubuntu) on my old laptop and it works great
[17:23] <IMTheNachoMan> GeekSquid: llutz: a3ist: i tried but its still asking for pssword
[17:24] <a3ist> IMTheNachoMan, are you talking about asking for a pw when generating a key, or when transferring?
[17:24] <GeekSquid> On osx or ubu?
[17:24] <Res2216firestar> Hi, I'm on 10.04, and  when I plug in an external USB hard drive, it mounts so that my admin user can read the contents, but only root can modify files. I tried sudo chown, but it said "Operation not permitted". Is there any way of configuring it so that I have full access?
[17:24] <IMTheNachoMan> a3ist: when sshing
[17:24] <IMTheNachoMan> what permissions do directories have to be?
[17:24] <a3ist> IMTheNachoMan, when you generated the key, did you enter a password or did you just hit enter
[17:24] <IMTheNachoMan> a3ist: enter
[17:25] <a3ist> Have you already transferred the key?
[17:25] <GeekSquid> !fstab | Res2216firestar
[17:25] <ubottu> Res2216firestar: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[17:25] <Assid> err how do i eject a drive all together?
[17:25] <pansement> !join ubuntu-fr
[17:25] <a3ist> If you haven't transferred the key yet you'll need to use the password to ssh over; it won't let you automatically log in until it has the key on the server side
[17:25] <Assid> its an externa esata drive.. i can eject/unmount.. but i cant find a way to eject the device
[17:25] <Res2216firestar> Ok, I'll take a look
[17:26] <a3ist> once you get the key in the authorized keys on the server side THEN you can log in without a password
[17:26] <ubuntu_> i try live linuxmint, but not working: my pc is: amdx2 64bit, 1gb ram, gigabyte motherboard with integral vga. problem: mint logo ok, but desktop, not seeing, but vertical lines, and color cubes
[17:26] <GeekSquid> Assid: what type of drive?
[17:26] <IMTheNachoMan> a3ist: i did transfer the .pub key to .ssh/authorized_keys on ubuntu
[17:26] <a3ist> ubuntu_, try lubuntu
[17:26] <Assid> its actually an internal drive mounted over a hdd dock station
[17:26] <wise_crypt> !mint | ubuntu_
[17:26] <ubottu> ubuntu_: There are some Ubuntu derivatives that we cannot provide support for due to repository and software changes. Please consult their websites for more information. Examples: gNewSense (support in #gnewsense), Linux Mint (see !mintsupport), LinuxMCE (support in #linuxmce), CrunchBang (support in #crunchbang), BackTrack (support in #backtrack-linux)
[17:26] <ubuntu_> ok
[17:26] <Assid> GeekSquid: connected via esata
[17:27] <kjele> IMTheNachoMan: use ssh-copy-id
[17:27] <mosno> somebody udpate ubottu, crunchbang no longer derive from ubuntu :)
[17:27] <a3ist> IMTheNachoMan, if the username you're using on OSX is different than the one on the ubuntu box, you'll need to specify that in your ssh login
[17:27] <IMTheNachoMan> i  did
[17:27] <a3ist> ie "username@ubuntuhostname"
[17:27] <mosno> (although i suppose people may still be on older versions)
[17:27] <a3ist> hmm....
[17:28] <GeekSquid> Assid: you should be able to sudo umount /dev/sdxxxx the drive and unplug
[17:28] <a3ist> this is a hard one to visualize, since we can't really ask you to pastebin your keys and stuff
[17:28] <a3ist> that'd defeat the purpose of them
[17:28] <dtcrshr> how do i have sound on open office widh pps ?
[17:28] <llutz> IMTheNachoMan: use "ssh -vvv user@host" to connect and watch the output for errors
[17:28] <Assid> GeekSquid: that isnt exactly hot swappable
[17:29] <rallias> how do i find out what my wireless adapter is called?
[17:29] <llutz> rallias: "iwconfig"
[17:29] <a3ist> rallias, ifconfig/iwconfig
[17:30] <kjele> rallias: If you mean SSID then you need to check the router.
[17:30] <zeitsofa> is there a way to setup the new gdm to have the old gdm xdmcp chooser?
[17:30] <onetinsoldier> mosno: i've never looked into crunchbang, mint, nor backtrack. however i decided to take a peek just now at the crunchbang website to see what it said. first thing i see --> "CrunchBang Linux is an Ubuntu based distribution..."  ;-)
[17:30] <Raquel> Helo my name is Raquel
[17:30] <Raquel> max
[17:30] <IMTheNachoMan> llutz: ty
[17:31] <exs> hi
[17:31] <GeekSquid> Assid: the drive still needs to be un-mounted prior to being unplugged, that keeps the drive from getting bricked, if you want true hot swap, get a drobo
[17:31] <trism> onetinsoldier: you need to read the first news post to see what he means
[17:31] <exs> i installed kde with install kubuntu-desktop and after that i deinstalled kde with purge kubuntu-desktop and a tutorial at ubuntuusers. now i have the problem that firefox still uses pixel fonts to display webpages. how to disable it and restore the old default settings?
[17:31] <Assid> drobo?
[17:31] <ubuntu_> how run windows programs on ubuntu?
[17:32] <Corp-Cornpop> anyone know a working freenode.net irc server
[17:32] <onetinsoldier> trism: ok, roger. i'm simply stating the first thing i saw/noticed when the web page loaded up, knowing nothing about crunchbang

[17:34] <IMTheNachoMan> a3ist: ty sir
[17:34] <onetinsoldier> mosno: well, there is blog post article right below that says... "The first alpha release of CrunchBang 10 is now available. Codenamed Statler, this release is, for the first time, built using Debian sources. Changing from Ubuntu to Debian sources marks..."
[17:34] <mosno> onetinsoldier: yes. so it hasn't happened yet, and i jumped the gun :)
[17:35] <onetinsoldier> mosno: but that's in much smaller font size/writing than the first thing that hit me when the page loaded

[17:40] <gothran> wise_crypt: thx I check it!
[17:40] <Vexc> onetinsoldier: I was under the impression that GDM and the X server was two different things.

[17:50] <netproteus> hi, is there anyone that can help me with an hardy -> lucid upgrade issue. The upgrade has hung on "Setting up  rsyslog. creating config file /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf"
[17:50] <blue_anna> is there a way during install to ensure you get all the 64bit versions of things for powerpc architecture?
[17:50] <vic20gmr_[lucid]> wise_crypt: i dont think it is a gfx card drvr issue
[17:51] <onetinsoldier> wise_crypt: i don't think the ATI proprietary driver supports a old 9600 video card. i think it has to be an x1200 or newer
[17:51] <vic20gmr_[lucid]> i think it has more to do with my monitor "driver"

[17:57] <Flyingwatermelon> i am running a partial upgrade I'm not sure why it says that

[17:57] <Ububasher> Watermelon; try upgrading via terminal 'apt'
[17:57] <vic20gmr_[lucid]> wise_crypt: ya, y i was hoping to find something that might do it for me, along the lines of startup manager "editing" grub file[s] for me
[17:57] <desperate_man> bastifrazor: cool, will try
[17:58] <Flyingwatermelon> i did sudo apt-get upgrade Ububasher
[17:58] <ibuclaw> Flyingwatermelon, checks if nm-applet (the Network manager) is running

[17:58] <llutz> going
[17:58] <iamm> yes, BluesKaj-Laptop, got already a question above... and just following up... not actually an impatient user here...
[17:58] <ibuclaw> Flyingwatermelon, what are you upgrading from -> to ?
[17:58] <tdnicho> using xchat...what is this red line that sometimes shows up in the chat window all the way across the screen?
[17:58] <Ububasher> did you use the '-v' verbose option. Could really help diag
[17:58] <blackstar> kjele, sorry man i took step by step screen shoots, but still having problems with pastebin, maybe i can email it to you?
[17:58] <Flyingwatermelon> ibuclaw, from 9.10 to 10.04
[17:58] <rallias> oh whatever i suppose i will go look into gentoo

[17:59] <llutz> mcl0vin: how did you install lirc?
[17:59] <mcl0vin> llutz: Compile it
[17:59] <ibuclaw> Flyingwatermelon, upgrade your system with:  gksu update-manager
[18:00] <anodesni> :P
[18:00] <Hunter^^^> hello people
[18:00] <blackstar> i'm new using the IRC don't know how to past it in here
[18:00] <llutz> mcl0vin: then deinstall by hand, you should have used package-management to install (at least checkinstall)
[18:00] <kjele> ibuclaw: Please do not use gksu with update-manager. Policy-kit should do it
[18:00] <Hunter^^^> can someone tell me how can i move to 1280x1024 screen resolution?
[18:00] <vic20gmr_[lucid]> anyone else have any suggestions about how i might "force" or otherwise get my monitor working at 72hz?

[18:01] <gyre> hi
[18:01] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: but from now on when compiling from source, i also recommend you learn to use 'checkinstall'.. and 'kernel-package' if you're compiling custom kernel

[18:02] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: ok, cheers. good luck
[18:02] <blackstar> kjele just waiting for u to accept it
[18:02] <netproteus> Any idea why my hardy-> lucid upgrade might have stalled at  "Setting up  rsyslog. creating config file /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf" and what I should do about it?  Or failing that what will happen if I bail out of the upgrade at ~75% complete?
[18:02] <ibuclaw> kjele, says nothing about polkit https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LucidUpgrades :)
[18:02] <mcl0vin> onetinsoldier: llutz after the 'make uninstall' how would i check if it remover it all
[18:02] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: let me know if that 'make uninstall' commands works out ok for you ;-)
[18:02] <kjele> blackstar: What is the url?
[18:03] <mcl0vin> onetinsoldier: it did
[18:03] <gyre> llutz: thanks...i'll try

[18:03] <blackstar> i'm trying to tranfer it thought the irc chat
[18:03] <kjele> ibuclaw: just do update-manager and you will see
[18:03] <FabulouS> kjele, myself =)
[18:03] <CodenameStrike> I need some help regarding the patch command
[18:03] <llutz> mcl0vin: you have to trust the makefile-author
[18:03] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: cool. you can do...  sudo updatedb && locate lirc | less    ...that 'might' show you if there's anything left over anywhere from it
[18:03] <Flyingwatermelon> okay, well I think it upgraded anyway...how do I remove the old version from grub?
[18:04] <GeekZoid> hello
[18:04] <GeekZoid> I"m using ubuntu and I can't figure out why my cpu is only reporting back as 1 cpu
[18:04] <GeekZoid> i have a quad core 6600
[18:04] <FabulouS> to mount an ntfs partition in ubuntu 10.04, it does not require the root password. How does it require a password for root, to mount a partition?
[18:04] <FabulouS> help-me
[18:04] <GeekZoid> but its only showing up as 1 core
[18:04] <GeekZoid> is there a special kernel i need to download?
[18:04] <kjele> blackstar: hmm . Open the file copy the content and go to pastebin.com and past it there
[18:04] <a3ist> GeekZoid, where are y ou looking
[18:04] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: but yeah.. what llutz said. you need to put some trust into the developer that the make uninstall script did it's job
[18:04] <GeekZoid> cat /proc/cpuinfo
[18:04] <GeekZoid> I also tried mpstat -P All 1 10
[18:04] <kjele> blackstar: Then give me the url. Clean and simple
[18:04] <mcl0vin> onetinsoldier: http://pastebin.com/t5R6nHY0
[18:04] <GeekZoid> still shows up as one.
[18:05] <blackstar> one moment
[18:05] <node357> FabulouS, sorry, your question didn't make sense to me
[18:05] <Flyingwatermelon> how can I check to make sure my system updated to 10.04 correctly without errors? also, how can I remove the old version from grub
[18:05] <node357> does anyone know how to get sound working in ubuntu 10.04, or should i just get rid it
[18:05] <mcl0vin> onetinsoldier: what i am trying to do is recompile it and try to get it to work
[18:06] <GeekZoid> a3ist: any ideas?
[18:06] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: you might want to remove that stuff in /etc. be careful you don't remove anything not related to lirc though!
[18:06] <CodenameStrike> Can anyone tell me, if I'm trying to patch a program's source code before installing it with a .diff patch, how may I do so using the "patch" command from the terminal?
[18:06] <Enelar> Hi all.
[18:06] <mcl0vin> onetinsoldier: what do you mean..i am trying to remove lirc
[18:06] <llutz> !checkinstall | mcl0vin use this to build a deb when compiling again
[18:06] <ubottu> mcl0vin use this to build a deb when compiling again: checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall - Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page, and DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[18:06] <node357> CodenameStrike,  i think it's: patch < /path/to/patchfile.diff
[18:06] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: also... rm -rv ~/.lirc
[18:06] <GeekZoid> don't i need a SMP kernel?
[18:07] <kjele> FabulouS: You need root permission if you are going to mount stuff with a terminal if there is no entry in fstab that says other user can mount it.
[18:07] <Flyingwatermelon> how can I check to make sure it upgraded without error? also, how can I remove the old version from grub?
[18:07] <netproteus> is there not anyone in here that can help me with an upgrade issue?? I'm feeling rather ignored
[18:07] <CodenameStrike> node357, do I run it from the program's source code folder?
[18:07] <Enelar> My problem. I install ubuntu 10.04 LTS, using it... 2 hours, but, it dont see sound cart on my motherboard.
[18:07] <GeekZoid> Can anyone tel me where i can get a SMP kernel for 10.04
[18:07] <node357> yes CodenameStrike, i'm pretty sure you have to be in the source code directory to do it
[18:07] <GeekZoid> it doesn't recognize all mjy cpus.
[18:08] <llutz> GeekZoid: they all should be smp
[18:08] <GeekZoid> hmm
[18:08] <GeekZoid> the one i have doesn't say SMP
[18:08] <GeekZoid> and i did a stock install
[18:08] <FabulouS> node357, distribution in ubuntu 10.04. When mounting a partition (NTFS) or any other partition, it mounts the partition without requiring a password. Already in version 9.10, to mount a partition, it requires the root password, so it can be mounted. Now it makes sense?
[18:08] <peacetara> GeekZoid: cat /proc/cpuinfo should tell y ou about the CPU's it found
[18:08] <mcl0vin> onetinsoldier: 'dpkg -l lirc' still shows ii  lirc           0.8.6-0ubuntu2 infra-red remote control support
[18:08] <blue_anna> GeekZoid: what is your uname -r ?
[18:08] <llutz> GeekZoid: grep CONFIG_SMP /boot/config-$(uname -r)
[18:08] <CodenameStrike> node357, so I did. How to know whether the patch process is finished?
[18:09] <GeekZoid> Peacetara: it doesnt find them all
[18:09] <Flyingwatermelon> how can I check to make sure it upgraded without error? also, how can I remove the old version from grub?
[18:09] <node357> CodenameStrike, you should get a confirmation that the file was patched
[18:09] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: ok, then you also have it installed via apt/dpkg
[18:09] <GeekZoid> hmm
[18:09] <GeekZoid> Llutz: your right
[18:09] <GeekZoid> its showing up as smp=y
[18:10] <kjele> FabulouS: Well can you change mount point?
[18:10] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: give me a few minutes and i'll help you with this.. walk you through it
[18:10] <FabulouS> kjele, I want to know how to configure fstab to require password when you mount a partition, without the terminal
[18:10] <node357> okay FabulouS now I see what you mean.. I'm new to 10.04.. checked /etc/fstab and there are no entries for my NTFS partitions, so I'm not sure how to require a password for mounting... very insecure
[18:10] <GeekZoid> Why the heck is it only showing up as 1 cpu ive got a Q6600?
[18:10] <GeekZoid> maybe its something in the bios
[18:10] <GeekZoid> brb
[18:10] <llutz> GeekZoid: grep processor  /proc/cpuinfo
[18:10] <Boxici> !backtrack

[18:10] <node357> hi, i removed pulseaudio so the games i own would run properly with sound, but now games from ubuntu repositories have no sound
[18:11] <kjele> FabulouS: The mount is from nautilus
[18:11] <Flyingwatermelon> how can I check to make sure it upgraded without error? also, how can I remove the old version from grub?
[18:11] <GeekZoid> ill be back im going to check the bios..
[18:11] <FabulouS> kjele, is an exit
[18:11] <tertl3> node357: pulse audio is important
[18:11] <node357> the sound lags when pulseaudio is installed
[18:11] <node357> by like 10 seconds, it's no good
[18:12] <Assid> hi
[18:12] <CodenameStrike> node357, if I didn't get any and the process goes on - as in not coming back to the "user@pc" prompt that lets you key in any other commands to run, does that mean it's not finished?
[18:12] <lungan> I did ran purge pulseaudio to get my Spotify work in Wine, now my spotify works, but my sound on youtube etc doesn't work, can anyone help me fix this problem?
[18:12] <Assid> im facing a Geom Error when booting with my windows hard drive
[18:12] <FabulouS> kjele, but what I'm wondering, is security, already imagined some user has access to my machine and was able to mount the partitions, just because it does not require password
[18:12] <Assid> this is after i was playing with installing ubuntu
[18:12] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: ok, i'm here. you ready?
[18:12] <node357> darn CodenameStrike, I guess I made a mistake.. it shouldn't take more than a few seconds... I'll do some research
[18:13] <FabulouS> kjele, I see the fstab, try to configure it
[18:13] <tdnicho> tried installing kubuntu alongside windows 7...can't get either os to boot following restart...any ideas?
[18:13] <janejp> hi,guys...what's a dummy package?
[18:13] <bricky> hmm the latest ubuntu is the one with categories on the left side I.E internet, graphics, accessories
[18:13] <kjele> FabulouS: If they have physical access to your machine then they have full access. There is no security risk...
[18:13] <node357> CodenameStrike, patch -p0 < patch-file-name-here
[18:13] <ljsoftnet> i have powernowd installed how do i configure it?
[18:13] <node357> I forgot the -p0
[18:13] <kjele> FabulouS: The mount option you are looking for is in gconf-editor under apps>nautilus
[18:14] <Flyingwatermelon> how can I check to make sure it upgraded without error? also, how can I remove the old version from grub?
[18:14] <node357> how do I get proper sound with/without pulseaudio?? this is so stupid
[18:14] <peacetara> Flyingwatermelon: that what upgraded without error?
[18:14] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: you need any help?
[18:14] <FabulouS> kjele, ok thanks
[18:14] <bricky> someone wanna help me out, I juts got ubuntu, used linux before but im still new

[18:15] <node357> what do you need, bricky
[18:15] <CodenameStrike> node357, since I keyed in "patch -p1 ../patchname.diff" from the folder, did missed anythung?
[18:15] <peacetara> Flyingwatermelon: does the machine work? then chances are it upgraded ok.. did you get errors during upgrade?
[18:15] <ljsoftnet> i have powernowd installed how do i configure it? there's no GUI
[18:15] <janejp> hi,guys...what's a dummy package?
[18:15] <Assid> anyone?
[18:15] <bricky> node357: just basic stuff nothing at all technical
[18:16] <node357> CodenameStrike, not sure what the difference is between -p0 and -p1 .. the last time I did a patch, it aid something like "file patched successfully"
[18:16] <node357> bricky, you could probably learn the basics on the ubuntu web site
[18:16] <bricky> node357: okay I will definitly look around on there
[18:16] <node357> I'm not gonna be here much longer since no one seems to have an answer
[18:16] <krylon> Hello folks, I'm having a little trouble trying to install a package. I'm running 10.04 x86. Trying to install openbios-sparc
[18:16] <bricky> Ty
[18:16] <Flyingwatermelon> peacetara, yes it said somthing about not finding all sources to upgrade
[18:16] <node357> good luck bricky
[18:16] <bricky> sometimes I need to be reminded :)
[18:17] <Flyingwatermelon> peacetara, but it upgraded anyway lol
[18:17] <Lonia> Hi all, do any of you know how to solve a Grub Error 17?
[18:17] <bricky> hehe
[18:17] <node357> SOUND: how do you make it work in Ubuntu 10.04 ?
[18:17] <Jordan_U> Flyingwatermelon: If you used "sudo apt-get upgrade" then depending on what else you did you are either still completely on 9.10 or in a really bad state between 9.10 and 10.04. In *no* circumstance will "sudo apt-get upgrade" properly upgrade between major releases.
[18:17] <bricky> node357: I think I remember you your name is sort of familiar
[18:17] <node357> same bricky :)
[18:17] <bricky> from a few years ago
[18:17] <Blackhat> r
[18:17] <pdtpatri2k> Has anyone gotten magic mouse to work on Ubuntu 10.4?
[18:17] <Docteh> node357: usuallly just does :-/
[18:18] <Flyingwatermelon> Jordan_U, that's what I did...how to fix it?
[18:18] <Blackhat> hello guise
[18:18] <node357> it was a few years ago I started attempting to use Ubuntu, and I'm still trying to make it work
[18:18] <kjele> blackstar: Still problems ? I see that you wanted to send a 6mb file that is kinda big. I just need to know what permissions are set on the file
[18:18] <infid> i installed seahorse-plugins but i still dont see any option in nautilus to encrypt files with GPG, any ideas?
[18:18] <ljsoftnet> i have powernowd installed how do i configure it? there's no GUI
[18:18] <node357> I guess I should shell out $250 for paid support... to get sound working :|
[18:18] <Jordan_U> Flyingwatermelon: Did you do anything else like modify your sources.list?
[18:18] <koichirose> hello. I'm having trouble installing mencoder. it says it depends on libdirac0c2a, but this package has been replaced by libdirac-encoder0 . How do I solve this? Some googling did not help
[18:18] <Vax_> hello, does anyone knows how to setup a global menu in gnome?
[18:18] <Flyingwatermelon> Jordan_U, no
[18:19] <ubuntu_> good bye
[18:19] <node357> Vax_, you mean a menu that all users see? isn't that already set up by default?
[18:19] <ubuntu_> thank you veru much the answers
[18:19] <kjele> Vax_: There is a ppa out there. Last time I used firefox was broken
[18:19] <Jordan_U> Flyingwatermelon: Then nothing bad has happened, and you are still completely on 9.10.
[18:19] <xangua> Vax_: have yoy tried gnome applet global menu <unconvertable>
[18:19] <krylon> How do I install this package in 10.04? apt-get install openbios-sparc gives error: not available, but is referred to by another package,etc
[18:19] <Blackhat> how can i check what version of my distro im running_
[18:19] <krylon> http://packages.ubuntu.com/hu/source/lucid/openbios-sparc
[18:19] <janejp> hi
[18:19] <Flyingwatermelon> Jordan_U, well, I went to upgrade manager and installed all upgrades...and installed 10.04 from there?
[18:19] <node357> so no one here has any idea how sound in Ubuntu works
[18:19] <Docteh> node357: from canonical? sounds fun but expensive.
[18:19] <onetinsoldier> mcl0vin: are you here at all? need any help?
[18:20] <llutz> Blackhat: lsb_release -a
[18:20] <node357> Docteh, very expensive, Microsoft support is cheaper
[18:20] <mosno> node357: if this is a non-portable computer, consider spending that money on supported hardware
[18:20] <Vax_> <xangua>, nope. is it buggy?
[18:20] <peacetara> janejp: a dummy package is a package put there to make dependencies happy, but doesn't have to exist otherwise (there may be other reasons, but that's the most common).
[18:20] <Docteh> node357: well "i need help with my sound" tells us nothing
[18:20] <node357> mosno, it's a sound blaster live supported by alsa
[18:20] <bricky> node357: I installed ubuntu from an exe, it saved my laptop
[18:20] <xangua> Vax_: no http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/
[18:20] <node357> Docteh, i already explained the problem when i joined... don't start criticizing me again, i get that every time i ask for help
[18:20] <pdtpatri2k> Has anyone gotten magic mouse to work on Ubuntu 10.4?
[18:20] <mikeru> I'm curious
[18:21] <mikeru> why the battery indicator is horizontal on my laptop
[18:21] <Docteh> ah
[18:21] <Vax_> <xangua>, thanks, i'll check it out
[18:21] <Jordan_U> Flyingwatermelon: If you open System > Adminisration > Update-Manager then it should givve you an option to upgrade to 10.04. Anything else is just getting you minor updates to 9.10.
[18:21] <mikeru> and it's vertical on my friends laptop?
[18:21] <blue_anna> pdtpatri2k: the regular cordless or is it the two-button?
[18:21] <node357> glad to hear it, bricky
[18:21] <Jordan_U> !upgrade | Flyingwatermelon
[18:21] <ubottu> Flyingwatermelon: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
[18:21] <pdtpatri2k> @blue_anna .. the wireless (newest one that just came out)
[18:21] <ActionParsnip> yo yo yo
[18:21] <Flyingwatermelon> Jordan_U, it says my system is up to date
[18:21] <ljsoftnet> i have powernowd installed how do i configure it? there's no GUI
[18:21] <Flyingwatermelon> Jordan_U, does that mean I have 10.04?
[18:21] <node357> I installed Ubuntu 10.04, ran some commercial games I own, and the sound lags by about 10 seconds... I removed pulseaudio, now the commercial games work correctly, but the ones from Ubuntu repos have no sound at all
[18:21] <tdnicho> anyone know if I can safely install kubuntu alongside both windows 7 and ubuntu?
[18:21] <blue_anna> pdtpatri2k: nevermind I just remembered, its the wireless with the ibm-style nub .. osrry, havent
[18:22] <Jordan_U> Flyingwatermelon: No.
[18:22] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: Change mirror
[18:22] <node357> also, the volume control won't work now
[18:22] <Flyingwatermelon> kjele, what?
[18:22] <tertl3> node, never remove pulse :)
[18:22] <pdtpatri2k> blue_anna: yeah its giving me all sorts of problem. About ready to give it up and move on.
[18:22] <xangua> node357: or you could simple not have removed pulseaudio and set wine to use pulse instead
[18:22] <Flyingwatermelon> Jordan_U, how can I check what version I am running?
[18:22] <trollboy> so my evolution isn't working.. I'm getting the following errors launching it from shell:
[18:22] <trollboy> (evolution:5061): evolution-mail-WARNING **: Could not setup local store/folder: disk I/O error  and (evolution:5061): camel-WARNING **: something went wrong terribly during db creation

[18:22] <Jordan_U> !version | Flyingwatermelon
[18:22] <ubottu> Flyingwatermelon: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type <unconvertable> lsb_release -a <unconvertable> in a !shell - To know the available version of a package, <unconvertable> apt-cache policy <package> <unconvertable>
[18:22] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: if lsb_release says something else than lucid then change the download mirror
[18:22] <node357> xangua, I am not using wine
[18:22] <Kernel-Panic> tdnicho:  just type
[18:23] <ActionParsnip> trollboy: i'd boot to live cd and fsck the partitions
[18:23] <xangua> node357: what were you refering by commercial games <unconvertable>
[18:23] <trollboy> ActionParsnip, that bad?
[18:23] <peacetara> pdtpatri2k: tdnicho you could. it takes some magic bootfoo magic and at least 3 partitions (but really probably 5, 2 for swap)
[18:23] <onetinsoldier> tdnicho: i don't see why not. i have my linux on a separate hard drive, but i have Grub menu for all my Operating Systems, which are, Win7, Ubuntu, and Kubuntu
[18:23] <node357> xangua, games I bought that run natively on GNU+Linux, like Quake Wars, Doom 3, UT2004
[18:23] <peacetara> pdtpatri2k: but you can have KDE installed as well as gnome on the same ubuntu. it doesn't die or anything.
[18:23] <Kernel-Panic> tdnicho: Why not just install the kubuntu-desktop package?
[18:23] <Flyingwatermelon> kjele, it says lucid Jordan_U
[18:24] <pdtpatri2k> peacetara: what?
[18:24] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: Then you have lucid
[18:24] <Docteh> oddly enough i've never been screwed with by pulse audio
[18:24] <Jordan_U> kjele: You should not change releases by changing the mirror manually, please do not recommend doing so.
[18:24] <peacetara> oops sorry I sent to the wrong person
[18:24] <Docteh> !emu10k1
[18:24] <Flyingwatermelon> Jordan_U, how can I update grub to remove old versions?
=== Guest51560 is now known as darkjoker
[18:25] <dtcrshr> is there a channel here on freenode for open office ?
[18:25] <node357> I was using slackware, which doesn't include pulseaudio, and the sound in the games was fine.. I Just thought Ubuntu would be easier
[18:25] <kjele> Jordan_U: Some mirrors are old. Changing download location only. Not telling to point the point release to lucid.
[18:25] <node357> If I could just use ALSA everything would be fine
[18:25] <Docteh> node357: its easier until theres a problem ;)
[18:26] <node357> true
[18:26] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: What version are you using now?
[18:26] <peacetara> is there an easy way to get a list of packages that need reconfiguring?
[18:26] <k-rad> i had gotten a flash drive on ebay.  i never thought i'd be victim of it, but the ID's seem to indicate it was a hong kong fake since i use my flash drives between ubuntu and windows i often use FAT32 since that causes less problems unmounting uncleanly.  the flash drive won't take NTFS at all.  what can i use in linux command line to full up the drive increment by increment so i can tell its actual drive storage capacity vs the automatic readout for the
[18:26] <k-rad>  drive ?  i do not require a filesystem for this, just accurate results
[18:26] <tdnicho> thanks, Kernel-Panic...someone in the Kubuntu forum just suggested the same thing....is it easy to implement the KDE once i've installed kubuntu-desktop?
[18:27] <Flyingwatermelon> kjele, 10.04?
[18:27] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: update-grub --version
[18:27] <node357> I guess I could download the developers versions of the games... which kind of defeats the purpose of having nice easy repos to begin with
[18:27] <node357> meh I give up, i'll try again when a new ubuntu is released
[18:27] <node357> bye
[18:28] <Docteh> lol
[18:28] <Docteh> wont get fixed if its not reported
[18:28] <shesaidohyea> any votes for wired / wireless keyboards?  i'm having some weird issues with a logitech dinovo.. i'm thinking about going back to wired kb.
[18:28] <Kernel-Panic> tdnicho: kubuntu-desktop IS KDE
[18:28] <mcl0vin> onetinsoldier: sorry i was afk
[18:28] <k-rad> anyone know how to configure the gnome weather reporter to give reports based on GPS lat and longitude
[18:29] <peacetara> Flyingwatermelon: shesaidohyea wired will pretty much always work..  and no battery hassles!
[18:29] <Docteh> k-rad: read the whole thing in with dd and see how big the file is, like /sdc vs /dev/sdc1
[18:29] <comag> shesaidohyea: there is a linux keyboard from cherry with a nice penguin key instead of the windows key ;)
[18:29] <Flyingwatermelon> peacetara, what?
[18:29] <Flyingwatermelon> kjele, http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=CbzDmpDX
[18:29] <Docteh> dd if=/dev/sdc of=flashy
[18:29] <peacetara> Flyingwatermelon: ack I'm sorry my tab completion is being stupid! grr
[18:29] <k-rad> Docteh, i am a stranger to dd and would not know how to use that as any measure of anything
[18:29] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: hmm. "update-grub --version"
[18:30] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: Need to know the grub version
[18:30] <Docteh> k-rad: it'll write out a big ass file, and you just need to  look at the size of it compared to what fdisk says
[18:30] <Flyingwatermelon> kjele, aaron@watermelons-laptop:~$ sudo update-grub--version
[18:30] <Flyingwatermelon> sudo: update-grub--version: command not found
[18:30] <Flyingwatermelon> aaron@watermelons-laptop:~$
[18:30] <DsXack> sorry, and this http://paste.pocoo.org/show/220048/ bag in conky. i not find in launchpad
[18:31] <Kernel-Panic> tdnicho: kubuntu-desktop includes everything that would be in a normal Kubuntu CD. Just choose which desktop environment  you want to use when you are at the login screen
[18:31] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: there is a " " space between --
[18:31] <MaMoUs> FireFox Segmentation fault
[18:32] <Vax_> xangua, it's not what i meant. it just shows current tasks. I want the one as in macos
[18:32] <uLinux> Anybody can made ident work?
[18:32] <uLinux> !ident
[18:32] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: Anyway since you have problem with that command use this instead "apt-cache policy grub-pc"
[18:32] <Flyingwatermelon> kjele, /usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig (GNU GRUB 1.98-1ubuntu6)
[18:32] <Docteh> uLinux: for irc?
[18:32] <uLinux> yes
[18:32] <Docteh> !package fakeidentd
[18:33] <Docteh> hmmm
[18:33] <MaMoUs> FireFox Segmentation fault
[18:33] <Docteh> oh no such package
[18:33] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: Then you have the latest grub version.
[18:33] <tdnicho> thank you, Kernel-Panic...off to install it now
[18:34] <Flyingwatermelon> kjele, I want to remove the old kernels from grub though
[18:34] <sebastian> helo
[18:34] <Kernel-Panic> tdnicho: Anytime :)
[18:34] <rallias> is there a bittorrent client for ubuntu with unlimited peers?
[18:34] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: "sudo apt-get autoremove" Should do it or if you want then just uninstall them
[18:34] <wertwertgfhjrer> how can i run a command that needs sudo rights automatically at startup?
[18:35] <xangua> Vax_: and what's the diference with the menu of mac OS <unconvertable>
[18:35] <uLinux> nobody seems to worry abount ident for irc

[18:36] <cfedde> kjele: ah
[18:36] <f_18> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grI1dHNBpBw
[18:36] <aeon-ltd> Flyingwatermelon: using synaptics or apt-get

[18:50] <ubottu> avg_guy: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type <unconvertable> aptitude  --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/my-packages <unconvertable> , move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type <unconvertable> sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install <unconvertable> - See also !automate

[19:00] <dead> Gideon: free up some disk space?
[19:00] <Talon_> gimme a sec, uploadin to my webserver
[19:01] <Gideon> I just installed it dead
[19:01] <Talon_> lemme know when you download it so i can remove it: http://talon.linux.sh/unicode.pf2
[19:01] <dead> mouka: the entry in your boot menu or actually delete the kernel?
[19:02] <mouka> I know how to delete the entry in the boot menu

[19:02] <dead> Talon_: you canremove now
[19:02] <Flyingwatermelon> and delete the entry mouka
[19:03] <Talon_> mouka: open synaptic package manager and find them and un-install them.. its always good to leave at least one other incase the newer kernel doesnt work right you have a fallback
[19:03] <dead> mouka: /lib/modules/kernel, /boot/thekernelitself /boot/kernelsystemmap
[19:03] <dead> delete those
=== arand_ is now known as arand
[19:03] <dead> make sure you don't delete your running kernel :P
[19:03] <oCean_> mouka: don't delete by hand
[19:03] <mouka> How do I find the kernels and delete them?
[19:03] <Boxici> !backtrack
[19:03] <ubottu> There are some Ubuntu derivatives that we cannot provide support for due to repository and software changes. Please consult their websites for more information. Examples: gNewSense (support in #gnewsense), Linux Mint (see !mintsupport), LinuxMCE (support in #linuxmce), CrunchBang (support in #crunchbang), BackTrack (support in #backtrack-linux)
[19:03] <oCean_> mouka: list your installed kernels: "dpkg -l | grep linux-image"
[19:03] <switchgirl> hi can you help me firefox is playing up - cpu usage = 60-75%
[19:03] <mouka> I won't delete them by hand
[19:03] <s3a> in ubuntu these days, to install new programs from the repositories graphically do you use synaptic or the software store (or what is it called exatly?) or both?
[19:04] <e01> how can i turn off the grub os choicer menu, or just to decrease time to wait?
[19:04] <oCean_> mouka: after that you can "apt-get purge <your-exact-linux-image-version>"
[19:04] <mikeru> I'm curious, why is the battery indicator horizontal on my computer and vertical on my friend's computer? (both are lucid)
[19:04] <arand> e01: Settings in /etc/default/grub
[19:04] <oCean_> mouka: err.. use "sudo apt-get purge", that's what i meant

[19:05] <pyresim1> not a linux noob redhat my usuall distb  need xbox help
[19:05] <s3a> kjele: thanks, is it still called the "software store"?
[19:05] <mouka> I removed the header
[19:06] <Flyingwatermelon> oCean_, it was a long message?
[19:06] <mouka> but not the actual kernel itself
[19:06] <kjele> s3a: they changed it to software-center
[19:06] <purplefool> since i upgraded to 10.04 i have been having troubles with the login screen being a mesh of colors.  i cannot read anything, course pixels are all i see.  i can login, but only through memory.  can anyone help me with this?
[19:06] <oCean_> Flyingwatermelon: don't pm uninvited
[19:06] <mouka> I have 2.6.32-21 and 2.6.32-22
[19:06] <bttf> I REFORMATTED MY PC and installed Ubuntu.. Then I used Gparted to partition my HDD for a WinXP install.. After installling WinXP, I was dealing with a lot of corrupt data... So I figured alot of things got messed up, so I decided to pop in Win XP and reformat the entire HDD and install a fresh copy of Windows.. IS THIS THE RIGHT PATH TOWARDS LIBERATION
[19:06] <Talon_> mouka: in synaptic package manager, search for "linux-image-" and you should find checked ones like "linux-image-2.6.32-xx-generic" etc.. uncheck the ones you want to remove and apply, they will dissapear from your grub menu automatically then
[19:06] <s3a> kjele: k, thanks also, they're not trying to deprecate synaptic, right?
[19:07] <mouka> OK
[19:07] <seth1> Please help. New to ubuntu 10.04. I'm trying to get online using a wireless connection and it won't even detect any networks.
[19:07] <kjele> s3a: They are. But you will have the change to install synaptic
[19:07] <lungan> I did ran purge pulseaudio to get my Spotify work in Wine, now my spotify works, but my sound on youtube etc doesn't work, can anyone help me fix this problem?
[19:07] <Flyingwatermelon> oCean_, http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=gv7i93HT
[19:07] <s3a> kjele: if you have the option to install it, it's not deprecated
[19:08] <kjele> s3a: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter
[19:08] <mc__> I do not have sound in most games and I'm on a macbook 3.1 , sound is working fine besides that
[19:08] <kjele> s3a: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/software-library
[19:09] <Gideon> Please
[19:09] <oCean_> Flyingwatermelon: another package manager must be running. Another apt-get, or synaptic or software centre etc..
[19:09] <Gideon> What do I need to do when I get an " out of disk" error, while I just installed it
[19:09] <oCean_> Flyingwatermelon: also, you have to specify a packagename you want to purge!
[19:10] <kjele> s3a: " ... it will grow to replace Synaptic, gdebi, some parts of the Computer Janitor, and possibly Update Manager .., "
[19:10] <seth1> I can't get online using a wireless connection. Please help.
[19:10] <Flyingwatermelon> oCean_, I don't know what I want to purge?
=== NightDragon is now known as Underbyte
[19:10] <Flyingwatermelon> oCean_, the old kernels?
[19:10] <s3a> kjele: yes but it will replace it in ubuntu and not the GNU/Linux world, right? like will debian stick to synaptic?
[19:10] <kjele> s3a: Only Ubuntu
[19:11] <oCean_> Flyingwatermelon: you better first understand what you are doing, before removing and purging software
=== ripps_ is now known as ripps
=== Guest56792 is now known as karthikn
[19:11] <Flyingwatermelon> oCean_, that's what I am trying to do lol I want to remove the old kernels as well as take them off the grub screen
[19:11] <s3a> kjele: ok im not sure if this is the actual definition but when i said deprecated i meant like not removed by default but removed completely,k so i know what i need to know, thanks
[19:12] <Talon_> seth1: although your wireless may appear to be working, it probably needs a proprietary driver, mine did. I had to hook up thru the ethernet and let the hardware drivers application find the driver for my wireless.
[19:12] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: "sudo apt-get remove --purge linux-image-2.6-32-21-generic
[19:12] <oCean_> Flyingwatermelon: as I said before: 1) use "dpkg -l | grep linux-image" to list all your installed kernel packages. 2) decide which one you no longer need, then 3) sudo apt-get purge linux-image-exact-version-goes-here
=== dxtr_ is now known as dxtr
[19:13] <Flyingwatermelon> oCean_,  how to I type the pipe in?

[19:13] <oCean_> Flyingwatermelon: not sure for your keyboard, on mine it's above the <enter> key
[19:14] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: The only kernel you "can" remove is the one I listed.

[19:14] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: "sudo apt-get remove --purge linux-image-2.6-32-21-generic" Will remove it
[19:14] <kjele> oCean_: Well I cheated a bit. He posted a pastebin when he updated grub
[19:14] <Talon_> seth1: then maybe your wireless card isn't supported yet. you can look on the ndiswrapper website to see if your specific wireless card is supported.
[19:14] <Flyingwatermelon> oCean_, aaron@watermelons-laptop:~$ sudo dpkg-l | grep linux-image

[19:15] <seth1> Ok. Thank you.
[19:15] <Flyingwatermelon> kjele, what about the recovery kernel of that one?
[19:15] <onetinsoldier> milo__: just state what it is you are trying to do, and exactly what happens, all in ONE line if possible. if one line not possible, then use pastebin
[19:15] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: the recovery kernel is actually the same kernel with single as parameter.
[19:15] <purplefool> is anyone having problems with the login screen?  if now, how can i change the picture/login screen manually...haven't been able to find it.
[19:16] <purplefool> that should be 'if not...'
[19:16] <Flyingwatermelon> kjele, but I have 2 recovery kernels on the grub screen?
[19:16] <oCean_> Flyingwatermelon: "dpkg -l"  < use a space - but kjele is correct, there's only the -21 to remove
[19:16] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: One for each kernel version
[19:16] <mc__> I do not have sound in most games and I'm on a macbook 3.1 , sound is working fine besides that. the game I'm curently trying is freeciv - any ideas?
[19:16] <milo__> i can't play youtube videos and can't get access to the volume control
[19:16] <Flyingwatermelon> kjele, right, so don't I have to remove the old kernel and the old kernel recovery?
[19:17] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: That is why you have "sudo apt-get remove --purge linux-image-2.6-32-21-generic"
[19:17] <Snakkah> Hey there.
[19:18] <kjele> Flyingwatermelon: And I told you that "apt-get autoremove" Should remove the old kernel too. But it will remove other stuff as well if you are not careful
[19:18] <Snakkah> I have a question for some people here.
[19:18] <onetinsoldier> just ask
[19:18] <rocket16> !ask | Snakkah
