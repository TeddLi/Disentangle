[04:26] <scarter> read quite a bit... many options assume you are adding additional packages to create a custom cd and not replacing existing old packages with their security/version update debs...  i was thinking of something like a slipstreaming process to create an updated install cd of the same version. any website suggestions?

[04:30] <Khrajin> Toma-: No, should I?

[04:53] <ubotu> Automatix2 is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[04:53] <rmd_> MiMiC, why would that matter in the least for changing colors according to a theme?
[04:53] <wols> Tinned_Tuna: we don't support that
[04:53] <LjL> johnschroeder, some things are specific to the Linux kernel - some things are specific to Unix (or POSIX) systems in general - some things are quite Debian centric.

[05:03] <sipior> johnschroeder: you'll probably want to restart to make sure that gnome comes up properly

[05:03] <tobyb> is having an XP disk image a good recovery safeguard in case I botch my Ubuntu dual-boot install attempt? can i restore the image and thus wipe out grub in my MBR?
[05:03] <lusepuster> ikonia: yes, but it isn't any hardware thing, that's what I mean
[05:03] <djieno> leagris, what is the tool?
[05:03] <jrib> BrixSat: metacity themes control what the window decorations look like, gtk themes control the buttons and other controls.  gdm themes are for the login window
[05:03] <_malajenho_> I've installed proftpd, and configured, but it doesn't work
[05:03] <sipior> johnschroeder: no. it grabbed all the packages it needed for the GNOME desktop, and installed them

[05:08] <mon^rch> could somebody please tell me how I can prevent a specific program from being able to access the internet?
[05:08] <neverblue> _malajenho_, takes a bit to learn that FTP server :)

[05:09] <LjL> mon^rch: i think this has been discussed before and the conclusion was that you can't
[05:09] <neverblue> _malajenho_, ok, so you need to post your proftpd.conf on pastebin

[05:09] <_malajenho_> ok
[05:09] <_malajenho_> thanks
[05:09] <Pici> rmd_: Yes...These are metacity themes, They do not include icons or window controls and as such they do not get entered as a 'theme' just an entry in the customize window.
[05:09] <_malajenho_> :)
[05:09] <rmd_> Pici: I don't.
=== razone [n=razone@58.19.56.101]  has joined #ubuntu
[05:09] <neverblue> _malajenho_, you can port scan your own box, to check that port 21 (default FTP port) is open
[05:10] <_malajenho_> ok
[05:10] <thirdy> I have xfce, dat mins I can't run KDE and GNOME apps right?
[05:10] <_malajenho_> I'll do
[05:10] <mon^rch> LjL: karp you have a good memory! I was just starting to think that if Windows' firewall can do it... why not Linux's??
[05:10] <Pici> rmd_: You uncompressed the theme.tar.gz?
[05:10] <neverblue> unless you changed it... but the port scanner will tell you which service is on each port anyways..
[05:10] <johnschroeder> sipior:
[05:10] <rmd_> Pici: um, yes.
[05:10] <johnschroeder> sipior:i told it to do no configuration
[05:10] <LjL> mon^rch: i think you could possibly, however, use a program like "proxychains" (there are others as well), which are intended to trick a program into using a proxy instead of connecting to the Internet directly. if you give it no working proxy, i suppose that would mean your program won't be able to connect
[05:10] <sipior> johnschroeder: of what?

[05:11] <sipior> johnschroeder: ah, the mail server configuration
[05:11] <johnschroeder> sipior: yep
[05:11] <sipior> johnschroeder: you probably want to leave that unconfigured unless you plan on sending or receiving mail on that box
[05:11] <_malajenho_> neverblue:     port 21?

[05:11] <MuffY> My friend installed ubuntu, and he let the installer choose partitions automatically (which resulted in the death of windows). I asked him to paste his results for fdisk -l to me, and he says only a sda1, sda2 and sda5 are given. Might the windows partition be still alive at sda3 or sda4, because I don't understand why the partition enumeratoin would suddenly skip two numbers.
[05:11] <Pici> rmd_: Did you drag the folders in one at a time? Or did you select them all and drag them all in?

[05:12] <rmd_> PIci, forget it.  this fact is that this should not be so complicated.  at the very least, the documentation should be better, or the system for installing them should be able to inform the user what's going on.  this is pathetic.
[05:12] <LjL> mon^rch: actually, "man iptables" gives this option: "--cmd-owner name     Matches if the packet was created by a process with the given command name.".    this seems like what you want
