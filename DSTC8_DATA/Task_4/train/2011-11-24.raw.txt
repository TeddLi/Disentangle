[14:29] <MonkeyDust> su means switch user, not super user

[14:31] <Tindo> anyone know anything about conky?

[14:31] <ubottu> Robson9776: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[14:31] <bazhang> Tindo, whats the real question
[14:31] <VictorCL> I installed this application called rabbitvcs .. and now  Icant find it !!
[14:32] <VictorCL> how can I check whre is it?
[14:32] <Tindo> the real question is i have it up and running but i dont know how to edit the scripts to customize it
[14:32] <bazhang> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=867076 Tindo this may help
[14:32] <MonkeyDust> VictorCL  try locate rabbitvcs
[14:32] <moriz> victor: which rabbitvcs
[14:32] <zykotick9> Robson9776, the # file actually starts with a . meaning it's a hidden file - no idea what gammu-smsd is.
[14:32] <Sidewinder1> Myrtti, zykotick9, Thanks; I guess that the "other" user, in that case is root..
[14:32] <Tindo> thanks
[14:32] <harsh343> Hello all what does this command do sudo chown -R volition:volition /var/www ??????????????????
[14:32] <VictorCL> http://wiki.rabbitvcs.org/wiki/install/ubuntu
[14:32] <MonkeyDust> gammu is a mobile phone app
[14:33] <llutz> harsh343: "man chown" tells you what this does
[14:33] <zykotick9> Sidewinder1, "other" is the quote i have you means any user other the system, "other" then root (super user)
[14:33] <DeadKings> Anyone feel like hand holding a complete nOOb through a package install. I need to install crafty 23.4 to a specific Dir and am clueless
[14:33] <theadmin> harsh343: Sets the owner and the group of /var/www to "volition".
[14:33] <VictorCL> locate rabbitvcs return nothing

[14:33] <sKeiths> i have read somewhere that if i add " rootdelay=10 " it might work. can anyone suggest how i add this
[14:33] <Robson9776> zykotick9 : it's my file. just confuse with the # sign. shouldn't be started with dot (.) if it's a hidden file?
[14:34] <theadmin> harsh343: I suppose, that'd set it to root
[14:34] <zykotick9> Robson9776, yes a . means a hidden file - but the # doesn't really mean anything

[14:34] <harsh343> theadmin, ok and i am using this in ssh@ip then ?

[15:01] <enigma456> think no
[15:01] <bazhang> DeadKings, try alt f2 crafty

[15:02] <nebajoth> DeadKings: dpkg -L crafty
[15:02] <bazhang> DeadKings, try alt f2 and appname to run it
[15:02] <nebajoth> it will list all files installed by the package
[15:03] <zykotick9> dfgas, "metacity --replace" might work
[15:03] <nebajoth> and where they were put
[15:03] <DeadKings> Ok i uninstall it let me reinstall brb
[15:03] <zykotick9> dfgas, that's only temporary

[15:07] <alexandros12> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/864155
[15:07] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 864155 in xserver-xorg-video-ati (Ubuntu) "Nonexistent VGA monitor detected on AMD A8-3850 / Asus F1A75-V PRO" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[15:07] <nebajoth> anyone have any idea for fixing ctrl+alt+t shortcut in gnome3/mutter?
[15:08] <omabena> thing*
[15:08] <TK5791> I'm finding Unity more than a little frustrating, should I a: stick with it. b: switch to another Linux OS c: revert back to Win Vista?
[15:08] <subb1> exit
[15:08] <alexandros12> lol vista
[15:08] <subb1> quit
[15:08] <nebajoth> TK5791: theres another option
[15:08] <theadmin> TK5791: d) Use another desktop environment, such as XFCE.
[15:08] <DeadKings> I'm gonna install via the software center, than maybe you peeps can help me grab the binary
[15:08] <MonkeyDust> TK5791  i don't like it either, so i switched to a different fork
[15:08] <nebajoth> TK5791: yes, try another desktop environment on ubuntu
[15:08] <alexandros12> could anyone help me???
[15:08] <alexandros12> ?
[15:08] <nebajoth> TK5791: I personally like gnome3 quite a bit
[15:08] <TK5791> how do I switch to another desktop enviroment?
[15:08] <theadmin> TK5791: apt-get install the-name-of-the-one-you-choose
[15:08] <nebajoth> TK5791: You can install Xubuntu if you don't mind installing from scratch
[15:08] <Touns> TK5791: load the old classical manager
[15:09] <alexandros12> ?
[15:09] <theadmin> TK5791: Try: sudo apt-get install xfce4
[15:09] <nebajoth> TK5791: apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[15:09] <nebajoth> TK5791: apt-get install lubuntu-desktop
[15:09] <TK5791> theadmin: thamlks
[15:09] <nebajoth> (for LXDE)
[15:09] <TK5791> thanks
[15:09] <theadmin> nebajoth: Not "xubuntu-desktop", you don't want all the default apps that come with it
[15:09] <nebajoth> hmmm
[15:09] <theadmin> nebajoth: xfce4 gives you a desktop without the mess
[15:10] <nebajoth> they make good default apps too
[15:10] <theadmin> nebajoth: So does "lxde", "kde4", etc, the -desktop packages are... well, weird.
[15:10] <nebajoth> well, fair enough
[15:10] <nebajoth> just installing the xfce3 and lxde packages will probably give a cleaner ubuntu experience
[15:10] <alexandros12> anyone?
[15:10] <alexandros12> ?
[15:10] <DeadKings> darn okay I installed it and cannot find it again  alt f2  does nothing
[15:11] <alexandros12> ?
[15:11] <TK5791> I'll give XFce4 a try
[15:11] <nebajoth> DeadKings: dpkg -L crafty (at command line)
[15:11] <bazhang> alexandros12, fixing that bug? or what
[15:11] <hemangpatel> can i install ubuntu in USB ?
[15:11] <alexandros12> i need help
[15:11] <alexandros12> i can't install ubutnu
[15:11] <auronandace> !usb | hemangpatel
[15:11] <ubottu> hemangpatel: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[15:11] <alexandros12> i get get black screen
[15:11] <TK5791> I've tried to disable the login keyring to no avail... someone must know how to rid me of this annoyance
[15:12] <hemangpatel> i need to install ubuntu inside USB..
[15:12] <bazhang> !helpme | alexandros12
[15:12] <ubottu> alexandros12: Avoid following your questions with a trail of "Please, help me", "Can nobody help me?", "I really need this!", and so on. This just contributes to making the channel unreadable. If you are not answered, ask again later; but see also !repeat and !attitude
[15:12] <hemangpatel> not from USB..
[15:12] <theadmin> TK5791: k, good luck
[15:12] <nebajoth> hemangpatel: totally possible
[15:12] <bazhang> hemangpatel, flash stick? external usb drive or what
[15:12] <DeadKings> 'usr/games/crafty'
[15:12] <nebajoth> hemangpatel: just pick the usb drive as the installation target during install
[15:12] <hemangpatel> flash drive
[15:12] <theadmin> DeadKings: Yeah, that's the location, except you want it to be like: /usr/games/crafty
[15:12] <Sidewinder1> alexandros12,  If it's a confirmed bug, you have two choices: Wait until "they" fix it, or fix it yourself.. :-(
[15:12] <TK5791> ok, xfc4 has installed... do I just reboot?
[15:13] <alexandros12> yeah sure....
[15:13] <bazhang> TK5791, log out
[15:13] <hemangpatel> any partition needed in pendrive ?
[15:13] <nebajoth> TK5791: that's the simple way. You can also just logout and pick the new desktop environment in the login screen.
[15:13] <TK5791> bazhang: thanks
[15:13] <theadmin> TK5791: No need for that, lol, log out, hit the little gear thingo, select "XFCE" and log back in
=== avernos_ is now known as avernos
[15:13] <DeadKings> If i grab the binary and move it to another location will it still work?
[15:13] <theadmin> DeadKings: Of course not.
[15:13] <nebajoth> hemangpatel: have the installer partition the usb drive as usual
[15:13] <bazhang> DeadKings, why would you want to do that
[15:13] <nebajoth> DeadKings: you shouldn't need to move it
[15:13] <DeadKings> :(  I need the binary in a different folder
[15:14] <nebajoth> DeadKings: Why?
[15:14] <auronandace> DeadKings: why
[15:14] <DeadKings> So a server can access it
[15:14] <bazhang> DeadKings, why do you need it in a different folder
[15:14] <MonkeyDust> DeadKings  try making a link
[15:14] <nebajoth> DeadKings: the server can access it in /usr/bin
[15:14] <nebajoth> DeadKings: you may have to reconfigure it
[15:14] <nebajoth> DeadKings: or try a symbolic link as bazhang suggested
[15:17] <TK5791> does anyone know how to disable the login keyring?
[15:18] <theadmin> TK5791: You can't really disable it, but you can set it to have no password
[15:18] <zykotick9> TK5791, sure, disable autologin is one way.
[15:18] <TK5791> theadmin: sounds promising
[15:18] <theadmin> TK5791: Just use seahorse
[15:18] <TK5791> if I set no password, will it still appear?
[15:19] <TK5791> everytime I login?
[15:19] <TK5791> seahorse?
[15:19] <theadmin> TK5791: No, it won't appear, and yes, seahorse.
[15:19] <DeadKings> okay dir from games shows a crafty folder but cd crafty returns Not a directory
[15:19] <theadmin> TK5791: It's an app that comes preinstalled
[15:19] <theadmin> DeadKings: Then it's not a folder.
[15:20] <theadmin> DeadKings: It's a file, binary to be precise.
[15:20] <TK5791> ok... my windows key won't work in xfc4, so how do I find Seahorse?
[15:20] <DeadKings> ok  ./crafty  to exicute
[15:20] <DeadKings> correct
[15:21] <DeadKings> I would like to copy that file to /home/bots/crafty  anyone give the command please
[15:21] <TK5791> theadmin: I simply deleted it... would that be right?
[15:21] <DeadKings> been since dos 3.1 that i worked the command line :)
[15:21] <fornix> on my hp laptop, when i change brightness of the screen using the function keys, it sets. When I reset my machine, my brightness goes back to being very dim. Doesn't it persist between reboots?
[15:22] <theadmin> TK5791: Deleted what?
[15:22] <theadmin> fornix: Yeah, I found that it doesn't
[15:22] <fornix> theadmin: is it the intended behavior??
[15:22] <TK5791> theadmin: in seahorses, it has one login keyring... it wouldn't let me modify it, only delete it
[15:23] <theadmin> TK5791: I see, hm, not even change the password?
[15:23] <theadmin> fornix: I think... For me it resets to maximal on every boot, lol
[15:23] <TK5791> theadmin: not even change it... will deleting cause a problem
[15:23] <TK5791> ?
[15:23] <theadmin> TK5791: Nah, it will get recreated but you'll lose all saved passwords from gnome apps
[15:23] <famgod> is there anyway to get rid of the graphical corrution when your running a composition manager and then run a full screen game (the game has really really bad corrution (turning off compositing fixes this, but I dont want to always logout/stop what im doing if I decide to play a game (vid card is radeon mobility 5650)
[15:24] <TK5791> theadmin: it will get reactivated... so deleting it hasn't changed a thing?
[15:24] <TK5791> :(
[15:24] <theadmin> TK5791: Well... it should have
[15:24] <TK5791> ok... I'll log out and back in again
[15:25] <theadmin> famgod: Write a script that will do, basically, the following: metacity --replace && yourgame && compiz --replace, it will disable compositing while the game is running, and use that script to start your game
[15:26] <TK5791> theadmin: so far so good
[15:26] <CaptainKnots> does anyone know of a good cad program for ubuntu?
[15:27] <milamber> CaptainKnots: what kind of cad?
[15:27] <CaptainKnots> similar to autocad
[15:27] <auronandace> !info qcad | CaptainKnots
[15:27] <ubottu> CaptainKnots: qcad (source: qcad): professional CAD system. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0.5.0-1+090318-9 (oneiric), package size 1228 kB, installed size 3856 kB
[15:27] <TK5791> now to my next problem. the IRC contact list has disappeared since I switched to xf4c
[15:27] <CaptainKnots> I'm going to map out furniture placement for when I move
[15:27] <TK5791> anyone know why?
[15:27] <admin1> ciao
[15:27] <famgod> theadmin, alright thanks, i should have thought of that :P
[15:27] <milamber> CaptainKnots: check out qcad for 2d and brlcad for solid geo
[15:27] <CaptainKnots> thanks
[15:28] <admin1> list!
[15:28] <CaptainKnots> also, any useful repos I should add to a new kubuntu 11.10 install?
[15:28] <theadmin> CaptainKnots: medibuntu probably
[15:28] <scalability-junk> hey guys is there any per connection limit with bandwidth in ubuntu by default?
[15:28] <omabena> hello ppl, I'm trying to share music with banshee and itunes, I installed a daap plugin but I get this message about itunes 7 compatibility issues, so any of you guys know if there's a workaround for sharing with itunes
[15:29] <theadmin> scalability-junk: No, Ubuntu doesn't limit anything by default.
[15:29]  * scalability-junk is confused ;) apache isn't limiting, ubuntu isn't, but why is it limited ;)
[15:29] <theadmin> scalability-junk: If you have slow internet on Ubuntu but it works "fine" on Windows, try disabling IPv6 in your connection properties.
[15:29] <solofight> people how do i clear the history which appears when i hit Alt+F2 and type some application name ?
[15:29] <e01> theadmin, expects the usability :D (rofl)
[15:29] <theadmin> e01: ?
[15:30] <scalability-junk> theadmin: no it's 1MB/s with one connection, but it goes up to 20MB/s with 20 connections
[15:30] <theadmin> scalability-junk: Oh, uh... Okay, weird.
[15:30] <exploits> ls -la
[15:30] <_ruben> could be tcp window scaling related
[15:30] <exploits> hi
[15:30] <capcook> exploits: ls -la ?!?! ahaha :)
[15:31] <fornix> scalability-junk: r u using pppoe?
[15:31] <scalability-junk> theadmin: yeah I thought it could be my network, but wget and is fine with 20MB/s on one conncetion
[15:31] <exploits> :)
[15:31] <TK5791> sorry had to log out
[15:31] <solofight> people how do i clear the history which appears when i hit Alt+F2 and type some application name ?
[15:31] <scalability-junk> fornix: not that I think i do
[15:32] <TK5791> so does anyone know what since I switched to XFc4 that my #Ubuntu contact list has disappeared?
[15:32] <fornix> scalability-junk: how do you connect to 20 connections? using 20 virtual ethernet adapters?

[15:38] <BluesKaj> Hi Sidewinder1
[15:38] <capcook> BluesKaj, i don't know.
[15:38] <capcook> i really don't read magazines
[15:40] <mathews> why my system not showing in the network?
[15:40] <capcook> i think this bot is really funny
[15:40] <wolter> where are display and screen settings stored in one's home directory or session configuration?
[15:40] <axed> lol

[15:41] <capcook> eheheh
[15:41] <Sidewinder1> capcook, You could also "open a private window/chat" with ubottu.
[15:41] <mathews> why my system not showing in the network
[15:41] <capcook> i know
[15:41] <ActionParsnip> wolter: which gpu/
[15:41] <wolter> ActionParsnip: nvidia
[15:41] <ActionParsnip> mathews: wired or wireless?
[15:41] <capcook> i only wanted to share this funny thing
[15:41] <wolter> ActionParsnip: my session has the resolution messed up, but the guest session has the correct resolution
[15:41] <ActionParsnip> wolter: I believe in ~/.nvidiarc   there is a hidden nvidia file

[15:42] <wil2> I don't suppose anyone can help me with a weird SSH rebinding issue after IP change? - http://askubuntu.com/questions/82280/how-do-i-get-ssh-to-listen-on-a-new-ip-without-restarting-the-machine
[15:42] <ActionParsnip> wolter: wolter: you can run:  sudo nvidia-xconfig; gksudo nvidia-settings    and then save the setting to xorg.conf
[15:42] <ActionParsnip> mathews: ok, which wifi chip?
[15:42] <ActionParsnip> hi VanMarco
[15:43] <wolter> ActionParsnip: but wouldn't that be system-wide?
[15:43] <wolter> where should the guest session "home" files be?
[15:43] <mathews> ActionParsnip, all other system running with windows showing in the list but system not
[15:43] <VanMarco> i've got a trouble
[15:43] <capcook> Sidewinder1: ok, i'll stop...
[15:43] <theadmin> wolter: They're deleted after logout, and are therefore stored somewhere under /tmp
[15:43] <VanMarco> yesterday trying to clean the obstructed fan
[15:44] <VanMarco> i may have damaged something.
[15:44] <mathews> ActionParsnip, is it normal or any issue with it?
[15:44] <VanMarco> Now the fan spin always, even if the temp is 41 <unconvertable> F and it sends out cold air
[15:44] <VanMarco> the computer's temp
[15:44] <theadmin> VanMarco: Try ##hardware, this isn't Ubuntu-related...
[15:44] <linda_> VanMarco, YOu damaged ubuntu?
[15:44] <VanMarco> That is ubuntu related
[15:44] <VanMarco> because i need something via software to slow them down :)
[15:44] <Sidewinder1> capcook, Just some friendly advice; I know, I know, my advice is worth exactly what I charge for it. :-)
[15:45] <ActionParsnip> mathews: you just dont have the driver configured for the wifi chip
[15:45] <capcook> :)
[15:45] <ActionParsnip> mathews: which wifi chip do you use?
[15:45] <mathews> ActionParsnip, atheros
[15:45] <jasonbassett> Hello
[15:45] <Hiz> $Gunel
[15:45] <ActionParsnip> mathews: ok, which atheros?
[15:46] <johndbritton> I'm running 11.04 and trying to set my hostname. I've set it in /etc/hostname and edited /etc/hosts, but when I restart the hostname doesn't "stick" If I run the hostname command it only stays until a reboot. Any suggestions?
[15:46] <jasonbassett> My Ubunti 11.10 machine is not restarting or shutting down, simply ends with the message "System halted"
[15:46] <ActionParsnip> mathews: can you run:  sudo lshw -C network      and give the product line of the wifi
[15:46] <ActionParsnip> jasonbassett: if you run: sudo shutdown -h now      does it turn off?
[15:47] <linda_> I just encountered an interesting phenomenon.  Xchat automatically joined #debian instead of #ubuntu   Now why would it start doing that all of a sudden?
[15:47] <wolter> there is no search tool in dconf is there?
[15:47] <jasonbassett> No
[15:47] <jasonbassett> i have tried altering grub acpi=force as suggested on various websites
[15:47] <zykotick9> linda_, because ubuntu doesn't modify the debian upstream version of xchat
[15:47] <ActionParsnip> linda_: what is the outut of:  lsb_release -sc
[15:47] <jasonbassett> all latest updates are installed
[15:48] <linda_> lucid
[15:48] <ActionParsnip> jasonbassett: do you have the latest BIOS?
[15:48] <Sorikan> is "find -cmin +10 -iname *.mov" the proper find syntax to find files that have NOT been modified in the last 10 minutes? Thanks!
[15:48] <zykotick9> ActionParsnip, it's normal - #debian was trying to figure out ways to sort out if it's actually a debian distro or a derivative distro - they didn't find one yet
[15:48] <desturrr> hey everyone, i was wondering if anyone can suggest me a project man. system like jira but open source
[15:48] <jasonbassett> Perhaps not, I will check.  It is a brand new Dell inspiron
[15:48] <ActionParsnip> zykotick9: gotcha
[15:48] <jasonbassett> deksotp
[15:49] <ActionParsnip> jasonbassett: doesn't matter, there could have been a new BIOS released yesterday with ACPI fixes,so newness is irrelevant
[15:49] <jasonbassett> righto, away from machine at moment so will try tomorrow, cheers
[15:49] <void_> is there any tool to search file contents from terminal?
[15:49] <ActionParsnip> void_: grep
[15:50] <ActionParsnip> void_: grep search file
[15:50] <secretrobotron> hi all. anybody have experience launching a firefox nightly from the unity launcher?
[15:50] <ActionParsnip> void-or:   grep -R search /path/to/folder       to search all the files in 'folder' and below, for 'search'
[15:50] <void_> ActionParnsip: thanks a lot. It works!
[15:51] <ActionParsnip> void_: grep is VERY powerful
[15:51] <ActionParsnip> void_: you can invert grep with:  grep -v search file
[15:51] <jigspan> how to set up snort on ubuntu 11.10 i386?

[16:02] <nvz> is natty 10.04? cause I thought that was lucid...
[16:03] <nvz> I thought natty was 11.04, and 11.10 was mavrick
[16:03] <brondy> is there an idiots guide to wpa2 used with a ported wireless router?
[16:03] <llutz> 10.10 is maverick
[16:03] <theadmin> nvz: Maverick is 10.10, Natty is 11.04, 11.10 is Oneric
[16:03] <jigspan> can anyone explain how to find out shut down problem?
[16:03] <brondy> and how to set up the radius server is the key i guess

[16:03] <Flynsarmy> in my list of startup applications i have one called 'caribou'. is it necessary if i don't use an on screen keyboard?
[16:03] <nvz> theadmin: ok, well I want natty on my thumbdrive and I can't find it anywhere.. unetbootin goes to 10.04 wich is what I had on there, and the site only shows 11.10 and 10.04 for download
[16:04] <renson> i installed it but don't know why stopped working?
[16:04] <nvz> theadmin: could you give me any advice on how to get natty?
[16:05] <ActionParsnip> !natty
[16:05] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) was the fourteenth release of Ubuntu. Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.04/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1104
[16:05] <ActionParsnip> !lucid
[16:05] <ubottu> Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) was the twelfth release of Ubuntu. Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/10.04/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1004 - Supported until April 2013 (Desktop), April 2015 (Server)
[16:05] <nvz> natty is what I am currently deploying and supporting, but I keep having to install 10.04 and then upgrade cause I can't find natty
[16:06] <nvz> alright that works I guess, should be able to strap that desktop image with unetbootin I guess
[16:06] <ActionParsnip> Flynsarmy: if you don't need it, remove it
[16:06] <nvz> ubuntu releases are confusing to me...
[16:06] <ActionParsnip> nvz: if you forget the names and use numbers, its easier
[16:07] <ActionParsnip> nvz: what release are you on now :)
[16:07] <nvz> well with 10.04 11.04 and 10.11 they all look so similar its hard to keep track of as a debian user who is used to a simple and slow release cycle
[16:07] <ActionParsnip> nvz: you'll need to upgrade to 10.10 then 11.04
[16:08] <nvz> ActionParsnip: I am using natty on here.. but as I said thumbdrive had lucid and have to upgrade to natty
[16:08] <nvz> I am not ready to support nor do I forsee ever supporting 11.10 cause the gnome 3 transition is horridly broken
[16:08] <nvz> unless you want to use unity which is disgusting
[16:09] <ActionParsnip> nvz: if you boot to the thumb drive, you can grab the 10.10 alternate ISO and upgrade to 10.10, then repeat to 11.04
[16:09] <ActionParsnip> nvz: you can use gnome3 without unity
[16:09] <ActionParsnip> nvz: unity is only a shell
[16:09] <nvz> ActionParsnip: I'm just directly downloading the 11.04 desktop iso then gonna use unetbootin to strap it
[16:09] <jigspan> ActionParsnip: snort manual u mantion is for 9.04(jaunty) is there difference for 11.10?
[16:09] <ActionParsnip> jigspan: I'd imaging it is largely unchanged, could ask in #snort
[16:10] <jigspan> thnx
[16:10] <ActionParsnip> nvz: if you wait til April next year you can upgrade to 12.04 in one leap as it is LTS to LTS upgrade
[16:10] <nvz> ActionParsnip: yes but I tested 11.10 recently.. about a week or so ago.. tried installing classic gnome and can't list on a single sheet of paper all the ways its broken.. cant modify the gnome panels at all, right clickign them does nothing..etc.. tons of little bugs
[16:10] <Weed> hi
[16:11] <ActionParsnip> nvz: you can use xfce in oneiric and it will smell and run like Gnome2
[16:11] <Weed> hmmmm
[16:11] <nvz> ActionParsnip: I don't want it to smell like it, I want it to be a fully working gnome.. heh
[16:11] <edbian> hello?
[16:11] <ActionParsnip> nvz: Gnome2 is dead
[16:11] <Weed> lol
[16:11] <ActionParsnip> hi edbian
[16:11] <tzanger> good morning.. I'm having some trouble getting grub installed on a software raid1. md0 is my root fs (ext4), md1 is data (also ext4). grub-install doesn't like it, running grub and saying "root (hd0,0)" doesn't print the filesystem type, and then "setup (hd0)" claims it can't mount hte partition.
[16:11] <Weed> who you from
[16:11] <nvz> ActionParsnip: I still use it, and I will use gnome 3 when its ready
[16:12] <deej1976> !ubuntu | weed
[16:12] <ubottu> weed: Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. It is developed by a large community and we invite you to participate too! - Also see http://www.ubuntu.com
[16:12] <tzanger> is this expected behaviour? googling has a plethora of help but all for ext2 it seems (which suggests that grub "just works" with a software raid1 setup
[16:12] <ActionParsnip> tzanger: you can boot to liveCD/USB and reinstate grub2, may help
[16:12] <tzanger> ActionParsnip: that's exactly what I'm doing
[16:12] <tzanger> I've got a livecd booted, got mdadm showing the RAID arrays, grub refuses to install
[16:12] <AfterGlow-WFH> does anyone know how to preseed the installer to either not install updates or how to change the security_path to something other than /ubuntu ?
[16:13] <ActionParsnip> tzanger: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/live-usb-sticking-grub-2-video/
[16:13] <Sorikan> is "find -cmin +10 -iname *.mov" the proper find syntax to find files that have NOT been modified in the last 10 minutes? Thanks!
[16:13] <tzanger> mounted /dev/md0 to /mnt/hd just fine. grub-install --root-device=/mnt/hd /dev/sda shows that grub can't dump the stage1 file because it can't mount the partition
[16:14] <jigspan> ActionParsnip: no one is available on #snort to chat
[16:14] <nvz> ew... I'd never put /boot on a raid.. thats just asking for trouble IMHO
[16:14] <tzanger> ActionParsnip: again, I've got usb stick booted. I've got my raid arrays set up and mounted. grub-install can't install grub because it says it cannot mount the partition (hd0,0) which is an ext4 partition
[16:14] <llutz> Sorikan: rather -mmin than -cmin
[16:15] <UncleTuna> is there an ubuntu for newbs website?  I'd like to read up on a few things that aren't discussed at ubuntu.com
[16:15] <ActionParsnip> tzanger: i've not used softraid in linux, sorry
[16:15] <tzanger> from grub: dump (hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage1 /tmp/foo says "cannot mount selected partition"

[16:15] <ActionParsnip> UncleTuna: www.omgubuntu.co.uk
[16:15] <UncleTuna> nice. thanks
[16:15] <AfterGlow-WFH> tzanger: I have half an idea I have seen a bug open about that but I can't be more specific sorry
[16:15] <nvz> UncleTuna: there is the little help icon that has a desktop walkthrough built in
[16:15] <bullgard4> [Thinkpad T61] After a dist-upgrade there is no sound output. Banshee shows a progress bar progressing when playing a music piece though. alsamixer does not show Headphone and Speaker sliders, it shows only "00" at their bottom. '~$ aplay /usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts/bark.ogg; Playing raw data '/usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts/bark.ogg' : Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz,...
[16:15] <bullgard4> ...Mono' but I do not hear a sound. What's wrong?
[16:16] <ubuntunoob> i have a question for you guys,  what is the difference in features between xfce4-power-manager
[16:16] <Sorikan> Hmm thanks llutz, will give it a try as soon as this mov is done converting.....
[16:16] <tzanger> AfterGlow-WFH: :-) np, right now I think that this specific version of grub either doesn't know about ext4 or can't mount ext4 in a raid1 format
[16:16] <ubuntunoob> and which one uses less ram?
[16:16]  * nvz wanders off to deal with the dangerously low space issue
[16:16] <UncleTuna> I'm fine with the desk top. But I will check out that first url
[16:16] <tzanger> AfterGlow-WFH: actually if I turn off the raid and try to mount /dev/sda1 as ext4 (it's a raid partition) it can't find it either
[16:16] <ActionParsnip> bullgard4: try:  killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse; rm ~/.pulse    then wait a few seconds and try some sounds
[16:16] <tzanger> that is essentialy what grub (hd0,0) is
[16:16] <llutz> Sorikan: cmin/ctime checks for changes like chown/chmod etc., mmin/mtime for data modification of a file
[16:16] <ActionParsnip> nvz: /boot on raid is fine on bootable raid cards
[16:17] <ActionParsnip> nvzmost users use cheap and crappy onboard raid which does cause issues
[16:17] <ubuntunoob> i heard that xfce4-power-manager is glitchy compared to gnome-power-mnager
[16:17] <ubuntunoob> is this true?
[16:17] <UncleTuna> I hope that manual is more useful that this dang 10.04 bible....$60.00 worth of...ermmm
[16:17] <Sorikan> Thanks llutz, I am running the find like that to find files that have finished uploading so that they can be converted
[16:17] <milamber> UncleTuna: it is :)
[16:17] <tzanger> ActionParsnip: I'm using straight software raid, not fakeraid. hardware raid would hsow the array as a physical drive so that would stand to reason that grub would just work with it
[16:18] <TK5791> I'm now using XF4C
[16:18] <milamber> UncleTuna: and if there is anything specific you are having trouble with - there are plenty of volunteers here to help out
[16:19] <TK5791> can anyone tell me to find the soundcard settings?
[16:19] <ubuntunoob> do you have alsa or a sound server installed ?
[16:19] <milamber> TK5791: there should be a volume icon in the top right corner
[16:19] <UncleTuna> milamber: I'm sure there will be...heh heh but honestly I just started on this box, still got another os on my hdd
[16:19] <ubuntunoob> and what kernel are you on?
[16:20] <Unknown53136> Hey guys, is there any way to strip down Xubuntu _a lot_? I tried doing it on my own during installation through synaptic but after that, it failed to compile
[16:20] <TK5791> in Unity it used to be on the top right hand corner... but XF4C nothing

[16:20] <setog3> hi, I have done some mess with my /usr/lib/ .. in fact I created symbolic link for all files in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu in the directory /usr/lib. Do you know a way to undo it ? (should I remove every link in /usr/lib and reinstall all ubuntu package to recreate link that should be there ?)
[16:20] <Unknown53136> it failed to install*
[16:20] <TK5791> 1
[16:21] <ubuntunoob> if you need lighter than xfce then install Lubuntu
[16:21] <zykotick9> ubuntunoob, FYI Pulse (the sound server) actually runs onto of ALSA - so you use ALSA either way
[16:21] <ActionParsnip> TK5791: if you installl and run volwheel, you will get an icon
[16:21] <Unknown53136> mm
[16:21] <TK5791> volwheel?
[16:21] <sskniranjan> how to create desktop icon for any application
[16:21] <ActionParsnip> ubuntunoob: can just install lxde, the apps installed will run fine in XFCE ;)
[16:21] <TK5791> do you have the terminal command?
[16:21] <ubuntunoob> i know that
[16:22] <zi0r> Hi
[16:22] <ubuntunoob> im just saying if he really needs it to be really light then install lubuntu
[16:22] <ActionParsnip> TK5791: its a package, like any other
[16:22] <ActionParsnip> TK5791: volwheel will be runnable from ALT+F2
[16:22] <UncleTuna> oh and btw " https://help.ubuntu.com/community" was what it appears to be what I'm after
[16:23] <sskniranjan> please help me with creating desktop icon for any app like that of fire fox for instance
[16:23] <ActionParsnip> sskniranjan: I suggest you copy one from /use/share/applications   or there may be a slimmer one in ~/.config/autostart
[16:23] <ActionParsnip> sskniranjan: firefox will have one already
[16:23] <ActionParsnip> sskniranjan: why do you want to make one?

[16:24] <shafeeqes> hey ..can anybodu help..how can i get classic interface (ie; gnome2 i guess) in ubuntu 11.10 ??
[16:24] <dabukalam> I took an image upon installation to be used as my login photo. Where can I find this image?
[16:24] <zykotick9> !notunity | shafeeqes
[16:24] <ubottu> shafeeqes: Ubuntu 11.10 uses GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[16:25] <zykotick9> shafeeqes, gnome2 specifically, isn't possible
[16:25] <zi0r> Im trying to find wireless networks around me. But iwlist wlan0 scan and iwlist wlan1 scan  detect only one wlanNetwork. My own. Unter the networkmanager of ubuntu (on the right side of the top panel) i see a lot of networks - More then 10. Has someone a idea what kind of problem i have?
[16:25] <tzanger> ActionParsnip: figured it out. the mdadm version 1.1 and 1.2 superblocks are at the start (or 4kB from the start), which prevents the old trick of being able to mount a filesystem that is part of a RAID1 array OUTside of mdadm, which is exactly what GRUB needs
[16:25] <TK5791> I'm in the software center and there is no VolWheel available
[16:25] <tzanger> ActionParsnip: the solution is to have a very small "grub" partition that is not part of the raid filesystem.  what a pain in the ass
[16:25] <Mad_Noob> test
[16:26] <ActionParsnip> tzanger: its the pain with cheap raid, you can use an SD card to store the boot partition.
[16:27] <bullgard4> ActionParsnip: 'aplay /usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts/bark.ogg; Playing raw data '/usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts/bark.ogg' : Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono' but I cannot hear any sound in my headphone.
[16:27] <tzanger> ActionParsnip: true, but that means I have to keep an sd card in the system. I will just degrade the array, create a new array with 1.0 superblock and copy stuff over, then migrate the old one over to the new. fun.
[16:27] <ActionParsnip> zi0r: try using wicd and you can set the wifi device name, network manager will nearly always use wlan0
[16:27] <milamber> Mad_Noob: works
[16:27] <shafeeqes> mm..ok thanks...
[16:27] <ActionParsnip> bullgard4: run:  alsamixer    and unmute and crank all levels
[16:28] <ubuntunoob> is there a way to make it so the wireless key turnoff works in ubuntu?
[16:28] <ubuntunoob> i have a dell latitude d505
[16:29] <bullgard4> ActionParsnip: In alsamixer I cannot crank the levels of Headphone and Speaker because there are no sliders to be seen for them.
[16:30] <ubuntunoob> maybe your soundcard is blacklisted:  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[16:30] <ubuntunoob> look at that

[16:32] <Lazure> does anyone know why i can't access a windows 7 share in ubuntu through nautilus? it says 'failed to retrieve share list from server'. BUT, if i do a terminal command 'nautilus smb://192.168.x.x' it works just fine.
[16:32] <Lazure> any way to fix it so the GUI will take me there the easy way?
[16:32] <TK5791> I downloaded it and extracted it... I've tried to run it and nothing happens... what gives?
[16:32] <Lazure> linux mint 10 was able to do it from 'browse network' just fine
[16:32] <zi0r> ActionParsnip, the networkmanager is not the problem. Just iwlist  ... it show only one wlan device.
[16:32] <Lazure> it's when i replaced linux mint with ubuntu 11.10 that it broke.

[16:47] <ubuntunoob> and  this: http://chrisjrob.com/2011/03/06/kde-power-management-in-pekwm/
[16:48] <Juggernaut> zyko: I do, but everything in KDE is broken, except the power manager
[16:48] <zykotick9> Juggernaut, plus, i still doubt you'll be able to use the KDE power in Gnome
[16:48] <Juggernaut> In Gnome the power manager was the only thing that was broken

[16:49] <antnash> oh
[16:50] <antnash> wrong channel
[16:50] <antnash> oops!
[16:50] <calvin> EgyParadox, why you want off topic
[16:50] <antnash> should have been in #xbmc
[16:50] <Juggernaut> It seems installing it would be possible, but I'll have to install a bunch load of KDE dependencies
[16:50] <Juggernaut> which I should have expected I suppose
[16:51] <ubuntunoob> actually
[16:51] <ubuntunoob> just a sec i have an idea
[16:51] <calvin> Juggernaut, the link posted to you ubuntunoob did you try that
[16:51] <Juggernaut> calvin: I have to reinstall Linux before I do that. So not yet, but soon
[16:52] <julian> i need help.. i need create a user??? i have debian squeeze... (comand: useradd)
[16:52] <ubuntunoob> julian wrong channel
[16:52] <llutz> julian: use adduser and ask in #debian
[16:53] <zykotick9> julian, use "adduser foo" instead -- and #debian is the real channel you want
[16:53] <Juggernaut> ubuntunoob: I'm going to try out the steps detailed in the first link
[16:53] <ubuntunoob> okay
[16:53] <Juggernaut> Brb
[16:54] <calvin> Juggernaut, re-installing has nothing to do with power management..it will still continue the post of ubuntunoob will fix it. just try it it will not harm the system
[16:55] <hh> Hey! I'm using fluxbox, and I wonder if there's a way to log off so that it would remember the windows I had open. Do you know of a way?
[16:56] <judh> free space is not available
[16:56] <ubuntunoob> nvm i thought i could find something in the kubuntu uninstall
[16:57] <ubuntunoob> but i didnt
[16:57] <EisNerd> uhm, ok could someone tell me wha tit needs beside ldap-configuration to allow a user configured via ldap to login at lightdm on 11.10?
[16:57] <EisNerd> as ssh works nice
[16:57] <calvin> hh, if loging off you are change the user how you predict the session to remain the same in next logon to diffrent user
[16:57] <cipherboy> sadam: In theory you could create a script that reads what applications are open
[16:58] <MonkeyDust> hh  look for "session" on this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Openbox
[16:58] <cipherboy> sadam: (when you log off,) and then on start up, it would read that file and launch those applications.

[17:11] <zykotick9> Guest483, what is your output from "lsb_release -sc"?  did you add an Ocelot repository?
[17:11] <lunitik> Guest483, that isn't really an error... just go into 'Software Sources' and remove the CD as a source
[17:11] <hh> Hmmm... I installed openbox; but I don't see and difference.
[17:11] <hh> *any
[17:12] <hh> I thought it should allow me to resize windows in fluxbox.
[17:12] <judh> i use ircii to connect to a server chat.freenode.net:6667 ? but error unable to connect to server what would i fix it?
[17:12] <hh> No?
[17:12] <lunitik> hh, did you actually go into an openbox session?
[17:12] <hh> I think so.
[17:12] <cipherboy> hh O.o
[17:12] <hh> I typed:
[17:12] <zykotick9> !enter | hh
[17:12] <ubottu> hh: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line. Don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[17:12] <lunitik> hh, fluxbox and openbox cannot run together
[17:12] <cipherboy> hh fluxbox can resize its own windows.
[17:12] <hh> exec openbox-session
[17:12] <hh> lunitik, how?
[17:12] <hh> Sorry, I meant cipherboy.
[17:13] <lunitik> hh, they are both window managers, you can't run two window managers at the same time
[17:13] <cipherboy> hh What keybindings do you have?
[17:13] <lunitik> hh, are you running a login manager atm?
[17:13] <judh> I want to connect to a irc server from my terminal. how can i do it?
[17:13] <hh> Okay. Monkeydust told me to install it so that I can log off in such a way that it would remember the windows I had open.
[17:13] <Guest483> lucid
[17:14] <lunitik> judh, many like irssi... with it, you can do 'irssi -c irc.freenode.net' for example
[17:14] <hh> So I should be able to resize windows through key shortcuts but not through the mouse?
[17:14] <Guest483> CD is not add as source
[17:14] <lunitik> Guest483, it has to be, else why would it be looking at one?
[17:14] <judh> lunitik i will try
[17:14] <shomon> another question: how do I find out what file is "writing data to device" and stop it so I can eject my phone?
[17:14] <cipherboy> hh: no, you bind some key (win key in my example) plus right click on window to resizing.
[17:15] <cipherboy> hh: not on my system with the config at the moment, but you should find it on google.
[17:15] <Guest483> now how can i install updates
[17:15] <phong_> happy halloween everyone
[17:16] <phong_> and happy new year
[17:16] <pikaciu> today is thanksgiving :P
[17:16] <cipherboy> phong_ you are late.. and early.
[17:16] <hh> Huh... Okay. And how about fluxbox remembering the windows I have open when I log off?
[17:16] <zykotick9> hh, a general Xorg method to resize windows is ALT+MIDDLEMOUSECLICK then drag to resize
[17:17] <shomon> how can I unmount a drive that keeps saying "writing data to device" or "device is busy"?
[17:17] <hh> zykotick9, I don't have a middle button on my mouse.
[17:17] <zykotick9> hh, i don't remember fluxbox having a "remember open windows" option
[17:18] <zykotick9> hh, no scroll wheel? that's usually a button as well.
[17:18] <hh> No... Laptop...
[17:18] <pikaciu> shomon: try with sudo
[17:18] <shomon> tried that
[17:18] <cipherboy> hh zykotick9 you could probably create a script if you wanted to...
[17:18] <shomon> I tried sudo umount -f drivename
[17:18] <shomon> device or resource busy
[17:18] <khelfanassim> Hi everybody
[17:19] <pikaciu> shomon: try without -f
[17:19] <zykotick9> shomon, close any open terminal (if a terminal is open inside that drive, you'll get that error)
[17:19] <judh> i tried irssi, irssi -c irc.freenode.net but i get the error  unable to connect to the server connection refused....what would be the problem?
[17:20] <llutz> shomon: fuser /dev/yourdevice
[17:20] <shomon> thanks
[17:20] <shomon> ah, what device is it?
[17:20] <|Long|> on ubuntu 11.10, how can i create shortcut for terminal and gparted on desktop?
[17:20] <hh> Ah, Alt+right clicking works to resize windows.
[17:21] <llutz> shomon: if you know "drivename" you should know the device
[17:21] <shomon> ah okay
[17:21] <shomon> it's just a symlink I think
[17:22] <llutz> shomon: readlink ...
[17:22] <Guest483> lunitik: you were right CD was in the source . i removed it. now updating. Thank you.
[17:22] <pikaciu> shomon: it's a floppy ?
[17:22] <hh> So, my ubuntu has been installed via wubi. I know that this means that the usual hibernate option is impossible. Is there a way to bypass that and somehow force hibernation?
[17:22] <shomon> no, sorry no idea how to tell what device it is
[17:22] <shomon> it's a phone
[17:22] <judh> i tried to connect to the irc server through irssi but i got a message unable to connect to the server connection refused what it mean?
[17:22] <lunitik> Guest483, you're welcome, good luck  :)
[17:23] <llutz> shomon: what's the "drivename"?
[17:23] <lunitik> judh, what server you try to connect to?
[17:23] <shomon> FC30-3DA9/
[17:23] <llutz> shomon: mount | grep FC30-3DA9
[17:24] <shomon> ah wow.. it finally said "write failed"
[17:24] <lunitik> judh, nm, I see... that shouldn't have errored though... try 'irssi -c irc.ubuntu.com' instead?
[17:24] <shomon> thanks anyway... I think it was because of an scp command that had failed...
[17:24] <lunitik> judh, (same network, maybe freenode doesn't want you connecting to its main server... most clients recognize it as a foward)

[18:11] <nightwalkerkg> Hi,i need help with my monitor. One person told me to copy this http://paste.ubuntu.com/748456/ to X11/something/something. I cant remember the name of the folder and the file and i can't make the new folder or file in that location.I am using Ubuntu 11.10,ATI Radeon 9550 card and LG Flatron ez T710B monitor.Can anyone help?

[18:12] <someonesomeoneel> How change user's name? Not username (login), but the full name which appears on login screen.
[18:12] <iamweirdie> l0n i didn't set this usb up- i was using pendrivelinux.com
[18:13] <iamweirdie> l0n is there a way to fix this through terminal?
[18:13] <os__> hi
[18:13] <zykotick9> l0n, i don't think that's actually the issue - probably something related to initrd and crypt.  iamweirdie
[18:13] <JohnH_> Can someone tell me how to change my dictionary to Russian on LibreOffice. I've downloaded one from thir website but I dont know how to make it work. Currently there is no spell checker even in English/ I want it to show me the wiggly red line when I write wrong words.
[18:13] <os__> does ubuntu server has xen by default ?
[18:13] <iamweirdie> zykotick9 fixable?

[18:14] <zykotick9> iamweirdie, the specific issue I notice was "is /dev mounted?"
[18:14] <tosse> the updated got interrupted and i had to restart and finish it from console

[18:15] <arlene1> hi there. my system is missing libsoftokn3.so - which package should I install to get it?
[18:15] <fab> what do "nomodeset" exactly ?
[18:16] <zykotick9> fab, if you are asking what nomodeset does, it basically disables the kernel graphics
[18:16] <JusticeZero> !enter FloodBot3
[18:17] <fab> i have this error if i boot than "nomodeset" http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?id=628641

[18:18] <zykotick9> JohnH_, you might want to try in #libreoffice channel
[18:18] <fab> i don't understand
[18:18] <nightwalkerkg> Can anyone help me?

[18:18] <SolarisBoy> looks like noveau driver is crashing for you fab
[18:19] <zykotick9> fab, sorry no.  I don't have any optimus devices - so haven't played with them myself.  I've just read people here having issues, and know that Bumblebee adds support for switching somehow (i don't have any specifics sorry)
[18:20] <fab> :/
[18:20] <fab> SolarisBoy, the probleme is if i add "nomodeset" my laptop boot correctly but i can't up xorg to FULL HD
[18:21] <SolarisBoy> nomodeset is limiting kernel graphics
[18:21] <fab> ok but, why one out of 10 it's work ?
[18:21] <SolarisBoy> buggy driver maybe not sure
[18:22] <SolarisBoy> is this a new occurrence  for you?
[18:22] <nightwalkerkg> Hi,i need help with my monitor. One person told me to copy this http://paste.ubuntu.com/748456/ to X11/something/something. I cant remember the name of the folder and the file and i can't make the new folder or file in that location.I am using Ubuntu 11.10,ATI Radeon 9550 card and LG Flatron ez T710B monitor.Can anyone help?
[18:22] <fab> yes, it's a new laptop with i7 and GT 555m
[18:23] <genii-around> nightwalkerkg: The file would /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[18:23] <SolarisBoy> fab assuming gt555m is the vid card,, i would check online if any talks about your ubuntu version and that card specifically,, try google
[18:23] <fab> i have already try bumblebee but no change nothing with nomodeset
[18:23] <judh> EC instance can provide free service with few spaces?
[18:23] <nightwalkerkg> genii-araound yes,and somthing like monitor.... .conf
[18:23] <SolarisBoy> maybe using a different video driver is needed?
[18:23] <genii-around> nightwalkerkg: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf  and then copy the contents in, save it.
[18:23] <zykotick9> fab, if you use "lspci | grep -i vga" does it return intel or nvidia?  i'm guessing intel right now.
[18:24] <fab> 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)
[18:24] <judh> can any one explain how to do the tunnelling?
[18:24] <fab> 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Device 1247 (rev a1)
[18:24] <judh> how to do tunnelling?
[18:24] <SolarisBoy> judh what type of tunneling?
[18:24] <zykotick9> fab, really both? that's interesting.  Good luck.
[18:24] <fab> if i try use nvidia drivers it's crash...
[18:24] <nightwalkerkg> Saved it,thanx genii-around
[18:25] <SolarisBoy> fab yes i have seen it

[18:25] <SolarisBoy> fab did you set nomodeset and update-grub?
[18:26] <judh> SolarisBoy, I dont know much but I want run BNC over the any webhosting server so that I could be hidden from my insttitute server
[18:26] <SolarisBoy> judh hmm i see making the sa's life hard at the campus huh =(
[18:26] <fab> yet i forced the startup without nomodeset for have max resolution
[18:27] <judh> SolarisBoy, what are the other tunnellings ?
[18:27] <fab> if i add nomodeset in grub the laptop boot same time but resolution max is 1280*1024
[18:27] <SolarisBoy> judh ssh ,ssl, vpn tunnels.. all types for different purposes
[18:28] <judh> SolarisBoy, how to do the ssh tunneling?
[18:28] <fab> I i tried many xorg.conf witch bumblebee / ironhide but nothing to do :S

[18:30] <ubottu> SolarisBoy: While Google is useful for helpers, many newer users don't have the google-fu yet. Please don't tell people to "google it" when they ask a question.
[18:30] <SolarisBoy> thats a link that explains the usage iceroot
[18:30] <os__> does ubuntu server has xen by default ?
[18:30] <iceroot> SolarisBoy: the usage of google
[18:30] <os__> does ubuntu server have xen by default ?
[18:31] <SolarisBoy> technically it's showing him how to use google =)
[18:31] <iceroot> SolarisBoy: give him a link where a ssh-tunnel is explained instead
[18:31] <someonesomeoneel> How change user's name? Not username (login), but the full name which appears on login screen.
[18:31] <iceroot> SolarisBoy: we dont like that here
[18:31] <SolarisBoy> i see
[18:31] <tosse> where do i find font settings in ubuntu 11.10?
[18:31] <fab> simply, if i add nomodeset, laptop every time boot.. And if nomodeset is not add, laptop boot sime type with full HD...
[18:31] <SolarisBoy> ok *we* my bad.. nough said
=== james is now known as Jarmes
[18:33] <zykotick9> tosse, does 11.10 still have "User Settings"?  There is a "change" button in older versions.
[18:33] <zykotick9> someonesomeoneel,  does 11.10 still have "User Settings"?  There is a "change" button in older versions.  (sorry tosse, TAB fail)

[18:36] <benignbala> Hi, I need some help with bochs x86 emulator.
[18:36] <benignbala> I am using this after a long time. Earlier, there used to be a command bochs-dlx to launch the default dlx linux demo.
[18:37] <benignbala> But I don't see that in any of the bochs packages now. IIRC, earlier it used to be part of the default bochs package. Any idea which package it goes into now ?
=== Jasonn is now known as hopp3r
[18:38] <benignbala> Sorry, forgot to mention, I am on Natty.
[18:39] <bassem_> is there better irc client than smuxi?
[18:39] <fab> i don't know who do :(
[18:40] <zykotick9> benignbala, (i'm just curious) why do you use Bochs?
[18:40] <JusticeZero> Is there anything similar to the dash in any other non-Unity desktops other than e17?
[18:40] <bassem_> is there better irc client than smuxi?
[18:40] <StepNjump> Hi I installed hplip (the drivers for my HP printer) and just found out after deleting all the files in my ~/download folder that some of those files in there belonged to the HPLIP install.. ooops...
[18:40] <benignbala> zykotick9: Just trying out a few low leve stuff
[18:41] <SolarisBoy> bassem_: i've never used smuxi but pidgin does irc
[18:41] <benignbala> bassem_: pidgin is good.
[18:41] <jutnux> Pidgin is amazing.
[18:41] <SolarisBoy> =) yes
[18:41] <StepNjump> As it was deleted with nautilus, there's no way to do CTRL-Z so what should I do now? Just reinstall HPLIP on top of itself or should I try to desinstall first?
[18:42] <zykotick9> bassem_, i'd personally recommend a real IRC client vs using an IM client for IRC
[18:43] <benignbala> zykotick9: Any idea where I can get the bochs-dlx ? Another problem is, the last time I used it I was on Debian(I guess Etch). But from google, I see a few references to bochs-dlx in gutsy
[18:43] <captainjamie> is there a fast way of replying to people on empathy and pidgin? (like clicking the persons name types "<name>: " in the chat window)
[18:43] <zykotick9> benignbala, sorry i have no idea, i played with Bochs a couple of years ago, but moved on to VBox and now KVM
[18:43] <bassem_> what is the better irc client zykotick9
[18:43] <benignbala> bassem_: Try Emacs/erc may be :)
[18:43] <SolarisBoy> lol
[18:43] <zykotick9> bassem_, do you want GUI or CLI?
[18:43] <SolarisBoy> irssi
[18:43] <jutnux> eMacs is about 3945035983459038 years old
[18:44] <jutnux> Geany is awesome.
[18:44] <jutnux> So i gEdit
[18:44]  * SolarisBoy vims
[18:44] <zykotick9> bassem_, xchat (NOT xchat-gnome) is popular for GUI, irssi if you want CLI
[18:46] <BernSamson> I have a question....how do you enable clicking on links in flash objects?
[18:46] <StepNjump> Sorry for repeating myself: Hi I installed hplip (the drivers for my HP printer) and just found out after deleting all the files in my ~/download folder that some of those files in there belonged to the HPLIP install.. ooops...

[18:46] <zykotick9> bassem_, just include my NICK in your message and I'll get highlighted (you can use TAB to autocomplete Nicks)
[18:46] <benignbala> zykotick9: Let's say I am trying a toy OS, it is much easier to create a bin file and a .bochsrc and launch bochs. Can we do it that easy with VBox as well ?
[18:46] <zykotick9> bassem_, "sudo apt-get install xchat" would be one way
[18:47] <bassem_> zykotick9: ok thanks so how to download a good irc client
[18:47] <apctr> hello every one
[18:47] <Gentoo64> same as any package
[18:47] <zykotick9> bassem_, see my message above
[18:47] <apctr> any one have idea
[18:47] <Gentoo64> apctr: you havent even asked a question
[18:48] <apctr> \??
[18:48] <apctr> about the c++ and oracle connection on ubuntu 9.10
[18:48] <Gentoo64> hello everyone, any one have idea
[18:48] <Gentoo64> ok
[18:48] <zykotick9> benignbala, sorry i don't remember bochs usage AT ALL - i basically got it working one or twice that's it.  VBox is very easy to use, and quite powerful.
[18:48] <bassem_> zykotick9: i guess i have to wait till the current install is done
[18:48] <zykotick9> bassem_, yup - you can only install one thing at a time with APT

[18:49] <zykotick9> benignbala, is this for testing deskstop OSs or for server use?
[18:49] <ssfdre38> hey where are the MySQL header files located at to install php 5.3.8 from source
[18:50] <ivali> How can i disable X on ubuntu startup? I don't need it most of the time
[18:50] <iceroot> !nox | ivali
[18:50] <ubottu> ivali: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[18:50] <ivali> thank you
[18:50] <benignbala> zykotick9: I am just trying to create a toy os for fun. :) nothing serious
[18:51] <pikaciu> bye
[18:51] <zykotick9> iceroot, do you happen to know, can Lightdm be disabled from /etc/init/ simply by renaming the file to foo.disabled (like you could with GDM)?
[18:51] <zykotick9> benignbala, vbox will be an excellent choice then.
[18:51] <Gentoo64> zykotick9: why not?
[18:51] <Gentoo64> if it cant find the file to start...
[18:51] <iceroot> zykotick9: never tried
[18:52] <benignbala> zykotick9: Sure, Thanks.
[18:52] <zykotick9> Gentoo64, i was just wondering if it had been tried, seems a lot easier then the whole kernel nox directions
=== root is now known as Guest35326
[18:53] <Gentoo64> well the kernel line on boot would probably be easier
[18:53] <Gentoo64> or about the same amount of pain
[18:53] <Gentoo64> what about apt-get purge lightdm and just use startx?
[18:53] <zykotick9> Gentoo64, that's a little more then disabling isn't it
[18:54] <Gentoo64> yeah
[18:54] <benignbala> Gentoo64: if we use insserv, cant we just edit the start/stop levels ?
[18:54] <Gentoo64> but if most of the time he dont use x
[18:54] <Gentoo64> then he might as well use startx
[18:54] <Gentoo64> its not disabling x in any way
[18:56] <BernSamson> Could someone help me? I'm wanting to be able to click on links and such in flash objects on 11.10 Ocelot...is there a plugin or something I need to be able to do that on such sites as Blogtv?
[18:56] <strange> hey guys my box restarted and it changed ip is there a way for nmap to scan a range of ips for a specific port being open so i can find my box back?
[18:56] <Gentoo64> yeah
[18:57] <strange> or maybe a script to try and wget a specific file from a list of ips to see if its there?
[18:57] <strange> either would work
[18:57] <Gentoo64> strange: nmap -p 80 123.456.789
[18:57] <Gentoo64> etc
[18:57] <Michiellllaptop> i installed gnome-panel but it's not the same as the classic theme in v10
[18:57] <strange> Gentoo64,  that would scan 123.456.789.* ?
[18:57] <Gentoo64> seperate ips with commas or use 12-34
[18:57] <Michiellllaptop> any other ways i can get it?
[18:58] <benignbala> strange: for a range of IPs do nmap  1.2.3.1-10. Will scan 1.2.3.1 to 1.2.3.10
[18:58] <renson> anybody who knows how to remove the lock file?
[18:58] <Gentoo64> strange: try just typing nmap with no arguments its the help screen

[19:00] <zykotick9> ArmyMan007, have you tried from CLI?  "sudo apt-get update" then "sudo apt-get upgrade"?
[19:01] <zykotick9> bassem__, does your webcam work in "cheese"?
[19:01] <Quantum_Ion> Cheese is very buggy
[19:01] <ArmyMan007> zykotick9, working on it, just a sec
[19:01] <bassem__> zykotick9, what do you mean cheese?
[19:01] <zykotick9> bassem__, it's a program - that usually works with webcams OOTB
[19:02] <bassem__> zykotick9, i dont know how can i find out?
[19:02] <zykotick9> bassem__, install it and see.
[19:02] <benignbala> bassem__: Install cheese and check it out
[19:03] <bassem__> zykotick9, will it work without installing the web-cam driver?
[19:03] <zykotick9> bassem__, maybe?
[19:03] <ArmyMan007> zykotick9, nope, still the same problem
[19:03] <bassem__> zykotick9, how to install cheese?
[19:03] <zykotick9> ArmyMan007, could you pastebin the error you're getting from cli.

[19:08] <mercury1> zykotick9, I know
[19:08] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, did the command run succesfully?
[19:09] <file_> hello, I need your help. I did an apt-get install mysql-server but its not asking me for a password and itherefore i dont know how to log into my database
[19:09] <ArmyMan007> yes, but it asks me to preform a apt-get autoremove to remove a no longer required package
[19:09] <mercury1> file_ You still have to configure the server yourself, apt-get install only installs the base files
[19:10] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, you can do that, or you can ignore it
[19:10] <benignbala> file_: dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server ?
[19:10] <file_> benignbala: tried that
[19:10] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, I assume you want to update: then run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[19:10] <file_> benignbala: did nothing
[19:10] <SolarisBoy> you can start with --skip-grant-tables
[19:10] <SolarisBoy> manually and set the password and flush the tables
[19:10] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, already did both of these
[19:10] <koo1> hello
[19:11] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, what happens if you run those again now
[19:11] <file_> mercury1: how can i configure the password ?
[19:11] <benignbala> file_: So, when you do sudo mysql ,it prompts for a password ?
[19:11] <mercury1> file_ Did you try sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.1       ?
[19:12] <SolarisBoy> file_: how are you trying to connect to mysql? are you using mysql client command line with -p?
[19:12] <file_> mercury1: yay that did it thanks alot
[19:12] <llutz> benignbala: use mysql -u root -p   , not sudo mysql
[19:12] <mercury1> file_ No problem :)

[19:13] <ArmyMan007> for file ca-certificates
[19:13] <SolarisBoy> afaik mysql doesn't install a password for the root user on ubuntu it prompts you to set it after you install the pkg =(
[19:13] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, ok, do this now: sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[19:13] <mercury1> it will refresh downloaded packages
[19:13] <mercury1> so you (hopefully) wont have corrupted files
[19:13] <benignbala> llutz: Oh, sudo mysql works too. when we do sudo mysql, what will be the username then ?
[19:13] <SolarisBoy> by default your username that you are i believe unless you specify -u
[19:13] <mercury1> benignbala, he already fixed it lol
[19:14] <ArmyMan007> ok.. working on it
[19:14] <llutz> benignbala: also root, but you don't use sudo if no need
[19:14] <benignbala> mercury1: I knew that. I was responding to llutz comment.
[19:14] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, although clean command didn't give me any indication of some sort
[19:14] <SolarisBoy> heh
[19:14] <benignbala> llutz: Oh, ok got it :)
[19:14] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, the clean command doesnt give any output
[19:14] <mercury1> thats normal
[19:14] <ArmyMan007> nope
[19:15] <ArmyMan007> still got corrupted message
[19:15] <mercury1> Can you paste the exact output to pastebin.com ?
[19:15] <ArmyMan007> of what? or the entire terminal?
[19:15] <ArmyMan007> starting from which command?
[19:15] <mercury1> starting from the last command you ran
[19:15] <ArmyMan007> update or upgrade?
[19:16] <mercury1> upgrade
[19:16] <ArmyMan007> upgrade was last one

[19:17] <CharminTheMoose> Is my hdd about to die soon? http://pastebin.ca/2095483 The load/unload cycles increases by 2 everytime I exit from suspend mode, which seems strange
[19:18] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, ok, I found the solution
[19:18] <mercury1> run this: sudo ls -a /var/lib/apt
[19:18] <mercury1> and paste that output to pastebin.net

[19:19] <renson> ubottu,seems not to be doing anything
[19:19] <ubottu> renson: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[19:19] <renson> ok
[19:19] <ArmyMan007> ubottu, hello :)
[19:20] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, do you have any special software sources configured yet?
[19:21] <trinimoses> hi all
[19:21] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, or did you not yet change anything in the Software Sources?
[19:21] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, nope... just had a complete installation after deleting ubuntu 11.10
[19:21] <trinimoses> anyone here using mod_proxy ?
[19:21] <renson> zykotick9, yes
[19:21] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, only selected best server, nothing else changed
[19:22] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, ok then, do: sudo mv /var/lib/apt/ /var/lib/apt.backup && sudo rm -f -R /var/lib/apt/
[19:22] <recon69_lap> Hi everyone, got firefox not closing properly and think that java vm i installed migh be the cause, i'v removed sun java vm, can i remove java common or is it needed
[19:22] <resistorr> I'm having some issues with a makefile that used to work under 11.04.  It seems that if I use g++ and link libraries, the libraries have to be at the back of the command with the new gcc arrangement.  But my old makefiles that use LDFLAGS no longer compile things.  Any GNU make experts know what the proper makefile fix it?  I see a lot of web posts on autotools using LDADD instead of LDFLAGS.
[19:23] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, make sure to not misspell anything
[19:23] <mercury1> trinimoses, on lighttpd ?
[19:23] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, copy-paste is the only friend I need :)
[19:23] <zykotick9> renson, yes?
[19:23] <rhizmoe> what handles the automount stuff when devices are plugged into the computer?
[19:24] <renson> APT crashed
[19:24] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, then do a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[19:24] <zykotick9> rhizmoe, udev eventually, but there are some higher level stuff first
[19:24] <rhizmoe> zykotick9: such as? i'm trying to disable shotwell crap.
[19:24] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, I'm right now changing the main server for ubuntu updates.. it's downloading package information, holding on for a while, maybe that will work
[19:25] <mercury1> you can try that too
[19:25] <rhizmoe> just looking for places to look. i'm fine with command line.
[19:25] <resistorr> other people seem to have similar problems with completely different packages, http://osdir.com/ml/sage-devel/2011-09/msg00035.html
[19:25] <zykotick9> rhizmoe, fuse through gnome - but to disable shotwell, Nautilus - Edit / Preferences - Media tab i believe
[19:25] <rhizmoe> if you don't think you're getting enough updates, just wait a couple days and there will be 50 more!
[19:25] <rhizmoe> zykotick9: i'm using gnome classic, whose nautilus does not include that tab.
[19:26] <rhizmoe> "who's?" what a drag it is getting old.
=== max is now known as Guest31531
[19:26] <zykotick9> rhizmoe, sorry - i forget about Gnome3.  I have no idea, good luck.
[19:26] <rhizmoe> anyway, that's why i'm looking for the sub-gui mechanism
[19:27] <rhizmoe> this really shouldn't be called an official channel
[19:27] <rhizmoe> (nothing personal, zykotick9!)
[19:27] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, sometimes mirror servers have errors in a file, which can lead to this
[19:27] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, working on your solution, hang a sec..
[19:28] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, but changing the main server and reloading can be the solution too
[19:28] <mercury1> try that first
[19:28] <renson> zykotick9, help me remove the lock file pls
[19:28] <zykotick9> !apt-lock | renson
[19:28] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, it didn't, the updates were 0bytes, so that didn't help
[19:28] <renson> yeah
[19:28] <zykotick9> !aptlock | renson
[19:28] <ubottu> renson: If an APT front-end crashed and your database is locked, try this in a !terminal: <unconvertable> sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a <unconvertable>
[19:29] <mercury1> ArmyMan007, then do this: sudo mv /var/lib/apt/ /var/lib/apt.backup
[19:29] <mercury1> and then do: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[19:29] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, already working on your solution, still waiting for update to finish
[19:29] <mercury1> ok
[19:29] <mercury1> :)
[19:29] <ArmyMan007> :)
[19:29] <ArmyMan007> btw, thanks a bunch for helping out :D
[19:29] <mercury1> I have 120mbit connection at home
[19:29] <mercury1> dont quite understand "waiting for update" :P
[19:29] <renson> zykotick9, apt lock  yes
[19:30] <crash82> mercury1, 120mbps ?
[19:30] <ArmyMan007> I got 5mb... and it still works like a 750k..
[19:30] <ArmyMan007> hey, has anyone heard of ninja tuna?
[19:30] <renson> ubottu, that didn't work
[19:30] <ubottu> renson: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[19:30] <mercury1> crash82, yeah, if Id move a few miles I could get 500 mbps :/
[19:31] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, it's downloading stuff, I bet you're on the right track here! :)
[19:31] <mercury1> renson, ubottu is just a bot that displays information if you say a specific command ;)
[19:32] <scorinitron> ubuntunoob, you their?
[19:32] <renson> mercury1, ok
[19:32] <ArmyMan007> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZHAb92E31E
[19:33] <renson> mercury1, but that did not work
[19:33] <mercury1> renson, can you upload the output info of the terminal to pastebin.com ?
[19:33] <scorinitron> Hey everybody! Morning/Afternoon (depends on what time zone your in)
[19:34] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, http://pastebin.com/17YaKyU5
[19:34] <mercury1> press y
[19:34] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, I think that was the reason it didn't work
[19:34] <razzi> excuse my ignorance, but can anyone tell me what is the easiest way to install lamp on ubuntu?
[19:34] <scorinitron> sudo apt-get install lamp ?
[19:34] <pangolin> !lamp
[19:34] <ubottu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[19:34] <zykotick9> rhizmoe, it didn't take me long to find that option in Gnome3. It's there.
[19:35] <razzi> scorinitron, how can i open a console?
[19:35] <scorinitron> Ctrl Alt T
[19:35] <scorinitron> razzi, I'm not sure about that command thou i just guessed cause it seems to work with everything else XD
[19:36] <scorinitron> *though
[19:36] <ArmyMan007> mercury1, Jackpot baby! :)
[19:36] <mercury1> :)
