<s> <user> : it wo n't work like that as the ubuntu <unka> are patched </s>
<s> okay , i get it , but what i am saying is that this computer used to have ubuntu on it then one day it just booted only to the grub rescue prompt and that 's all it does . when i run ls it looks like the files are there but the os ca n't find 'em </s>
<s> <user> : it 's base version + patches </s>
<s> <user> : that has nothing to do with your usb - fix your usb boot </s>
<s> <user> : is their an ubuntu git that has the source for the current kernel so i could check myself ? </s>
<s> <user> : no </s>
<s> <user> : and as i 've just said - it does n't work like that </s>
<s> <user> : pick the version ubuntu ships with , check it against the main line - do n't worry about the patches </s>
<s> ( being realistic ) </s>
<s> this is without the usb in ; when i put the usb in all that happens is a new hd and partition show up when i do ls on the hd at the rescue prompt </s>
<s> <user> : so ? </s>
<s> <user> : ok , will have to wait for this box to finish updating then check the source package for the 1 line i want :p </s>
<s> <unka> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> and it does n't recognize the filesystem on any of the hd partitions except the hd that is already there ( sans live usb ) </s>
<s> <user> : again so ?? what has this got to do with booting your livecd </s>
<s> what i am trying to say is that the liveusb is n't recognized when i plug it in and it has nothing to do with the liveusb working or not since it boots fine on the windows machine i made it on </s>
<s> i get the same grub rescue prompt whether the live usb is in or not </s>
<s> <user> : right , so think it through , </s>
<s> <user> : that suggests it 's not trying to boot from usb </s>
<s> <user> : so that goes back to the 3 points i gave you earlier </s>
<s> <user> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> <user> : 1 .) you did n't make the usb properly 2 .) your machine does n't support booting from usb 3 .) your usb disk is faulty </s>
<s> i 'm happy to get another usb stick and try again with pen drive but like you said , it 's not trying to boot from usb in the first place , all it 's doing is recognizing another hd partition . how is making another pen drive going to help since it wo n't recognize usb at all since all the grub etc . files are missing or corrupted ? </s>
<s> <user> : read what i said </s>
<s> <user> : which of those situations is more realistic </s>
<s> <user> : you know the pendrive is good as it boots on another machine , so you can have confidence in 1 .) and 3 .) being " ok " so what does that leave </s>
<s> <user> : i disagree . it is my information and was posted publicly without my permission . this is a fundamental violation of the philosophy of free software . if this is acceptable then why not send other information from users computers to any company willing to pay ? to </s>
<s> <user> : it 's nothing to do with free software philosophy </s>
<s> it 's an eee , with no cd drive , how am i supposed to reinstall if it wo n't support booting from usb ? </s>
<s> <user> : no where in free software philosophy does it say " data should n't be posted publicly " </s>
<s> <user> : > _ > </s>
<s> <user> : is there anything confidential in the post , yes/no </s>
<s> <user> : oops , <user> was the target </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> <user> : all of the information is my private property . </s>
<s> <user> , you can turn off the public post of the boot repair on the app . </s>
<s> <user> : is there anything confidential in the post , yes/no </s>
<s> <user> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> <user> : this is correct but boot-repair should notify the user before posting the information ! </s>
<s> <user> : is there anything confidential in the post , yes/no </s>
<s> <user> , can i suggest you cut the <unka> in half . ;) </s>
<s> <user> : all it has is usb ports . no cd . so since the ssd wo n't boot right , is this really bricked ? </s>
<s> <user> : no - please read what i 'm saying </s>
<s> <user> : ha ha ha . i guess <unka-> is the best you can do . </s>
<s> <user> : i understand your point and if you are that concerned you may want to contact the maintainers of bootrepair . i am just giving you the info i know from experience , wo n't hurt you to email the paste bin admins . i just do n't think they will bother to remove it unless the is <unka/> info . </s>
<s> okay , you are suggestion #2 as the option that it wo n't boot from usb and i agree with you , but i do n't know what to do as all i have are usb ports to try and reinstall the os </s>
<s> <user> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> <user> : any further discussion about this is off topic for this channel . </s>
<s> <user> : ok - so you 've accepted 2 .) as the likely reason . should your system support boot from usb by design ? </s>
<s> yes . i have booted from usb before . in the bios removable media is listed as the first boot check option </s>
<s> <user> : ok , so it " should " boot from usb media , and we know the media is good as you 've tested it on other machines </s>
<s> sure </s>
<s> <user> : that leaves us to 1 .) a hardware problem on your machine 2 .) a configuration problem on your <unka/> </s>
<s> <user> : so now you 've narrowed it down to the real issue </s>
<s> i *think* it is a configuration problem due to the fact that i am having trouble finding where the grub files are once it boots into rescue mode , it looks like some of the other files ( initrd.img for instance ) are still there on the partition </s>
<s> <user> : no ! </s>
<s> no , ok </s>
<s> <user> : grub is nothing to do with your <unka/> </s>
<s> <user> : forget grub - your machine is broke , you want to re-install , your proven install media is n't working </s>
<s> that tells us there is a <unka/> with your hardware </s>
<s> fix it before moving forward </s>
<s> thank you . </s>
<s> anyone good with mysql ? i made a symbolic link and apparmour do n't liike it </s>
<s> <user> : update the apparmour rule </s>
<s> <user> _ is now known as <user> </s>
<s> <user> what sort of update do i do , never touched apparmour before </s>
<s> <user> : why do you think the issue is apparmour rule ? </s>
<s> <user> , folks at #mysql sent me here telling me they positive it is apparmour rule </s>
<s> <user> : " why " </s>
<s> i followed this guide <user> URL/http:/ <unka./> <unka/_> </s>
<s> ok , just read the scroll back in #mysql </s>
<s> <user> : why are you changing the data directories ? </s>
<s> i setup an ssd </s>
<s> for my db </s>
<s> i really need my database back up and running , as its crucial </s>
<s> instead of reinstalling i just did this </s>
<s> you do n't need to re-install </s>
<s> for the quickest way of migrating </s>
<s> why are you moving this data ??? </s>
<s> that guide is terrible </s>
<s> my old hd ca n't handle the writes </s>
<s> i know i read the comment </s>
<s> really ??? how many read/write operations are you getting ? </s>
<s> well il explain sometime if it is n't relevant </s>
<s> really need this db up </s>
<s> <user> : i would suggest putting it back to normal first of all </s>
<s> undo what you 've done </s>
<s> then move it properly </s>
<s> i can undo it easily </s>
<s> that way your database is up </s>
<s> however , i do n't want another downtime </s>
<s> it 's down already .... </s>
<s> so get it back up </s>
<s> undo it </s>
<s> so while its down i want to fix it </s>
<s> i run a mining pool </s>
<s> people ca n't keep connecting </s>
<s> its bad for there hardware </s>
<s> you need some replication failover sounds like , so <unka> does n't affect you </s>
<s> then you should have an idea what you are doing and how to manage this </s>
<s> errr <unka*> </s>
<s> you ca n't approach this issue like <unka> </s>
<s> well i did n't really expect it to happen , <unka> i can put it back up </s>
<s> and you should n't be following random guides off the web </s>
<s> i did n't delete the DIR/var/ DIR/lib/ DIR/mysql/ , i renamed it </s>
<s> after syncing </s>
<s> easy to bring it back up </s>
<s> <user> , what do you have in mind > ? </s>
<s> hi guys ... my rub got fubar upgrading from lts to whatever the next version was ... 12.04 maybe ? i set prefix to ( <unk#a)-/> and insmod linux but get error : symbol not found : <unka'_> </s>
<s> <user> : what do you mean ? </s>
<s> SUB/s/ <unka/> <unka/> </s>
<s> <user> , i do n't know i thought you had a suggestion </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> <user> : i'd get the box back up , then actually <unka> the problem , and come up with a real solution , rather than then buying an ssd and following a random guide off the web </s>
<s> if your writes are as high as you are suggesting where a normal disk ca n't actually keep up - then you 'll blow that ssd away rather quickly </s>
