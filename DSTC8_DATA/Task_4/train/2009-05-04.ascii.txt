[00:02] <stepnem> there was some '-r' in that...
[00:02] <tobi> UbbyCD, and check your Audio Settings. Should be like 48kHz, 24bit (or more) for good quality!
[00:02] <slarin> im running Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and i need to know how to get flash and flash to work with firefox
[00:03] <myke_> lol
[00:03] <myke_> the X-Fi series is like the only one alsa doesn't support
[00:03] <zerothis> e1luca: there is a plugin for pidgin chat to hide extra messages. don't know about other chant apps
[00:03] <e1luca>  zerothis: tnx
[00:04] <slarin> anyone?
[00:04] <tobi> hitos, what did you do to fix it?
[00:04] <slarin> im running Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and i need to know how to get flash and flash to work with firefox?
[00:04] <hitos> tobi: I edited /etc/rc.local  adding the lines : poff -a; sleep 3; pon <provider name from /etc/ppp/peers>; exit 0;
[00:05] <jken146> slarin: 32 or 64 bit?
[00:05] <bondo689> slarin: firefox>tools>addons>get addons or some such
[00:05] <hitos> tobi: Actually, the "exit 0" was already there, i added the lines before it
[00:05] <zerothis> slarin: you might try installing ubuntu-restricted-extras, or even adding the  medibuntu repositories. these are proprietary solutions
[00:05] <M4rotku> hello all, can anyone tell me whether or not it is possible to undervolt a Wubi installation of Ubuntu?
[00:06] <Dr_Willis> slarin:  i normally install the 'ubuntu-restricted-extas' package it grabs flash and java and some other bits.
[00:06] <slarin> 32 bit and im a linux newbie
[00:06] <tobi> hitos, ... your are running Jaunty as well?
[00:07] <jken146> slarin: In that case, install the package  flashplugin-nonfree
[00:07] <hitos> tobi: Yes.
[00:07] <tylere> Anyone have any luck getting windowed mode working properly in Ubuntu? Disabling compiz allows it to start, but also causes me to lose my top menubar and taskbar

[00:08] <kendall78> usser, I tried my wired connection and then I am able to connect to the internet via that on Eth0.  My internal wireless wil not connect to WWW but apears connected to router. I am not using a proxy.  The router is Belkin G+ MIMO.  Also the wireless "just worked" on initial install.  I don't recall making any network changes prior to last shutdown and now it doesn't work.  It has me baffeled.  I had installed Debian 5.0 "Lenny" and
[00:09] <slarin> jken146 what do i do after i do apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[00:09] <genii> slarin: Hit enter key
[00:09] <jken146> slarin: Restart firefox and try youtube
=== Guest65026 is now known as pete_^
[00:09] <slarin> jken146 will do
=== \0 is now known as root
[00:10] <pete_^> after swapping out a nic I now have eth0 and eth3 (instead of the expected eth1).. I could probably remap it with udev, but does anyone have an idea why eth3 may have been chosen in the first place?
[00:11] <slarin> jken146 thank you so much it worked :)
[00:11] <geiseri> hi, is there a way to map something like CTRL+P to XF86AudioPause using xmodmap?

[00:12] <TopRamen> guys, I need a mail server strictly for sending mail for an application we have running on an ubuntu server. we don't need it for receiving and delivering mail to users. for this use case, which is better, sendmail or postfix?
[00:12] <hitos> tobi: I wasn't able to find any way to actually fix it.
[00:12] <TopRamen> I need something lightweight that wont consume to much of the server's resources
[00:13] <TopRamen> too much
[00:13] <dork_paste> Hey, I'm looking for a really good game nativ e to ubuntu are there any good ones?
[00:13] <rdove> sendmail really doesnt take too much resources, the biggest thing is making sure its secure so other people don't send mail using it
[00:13] <Peacefull> ice are you getting any kind of error?
[00:13] <Peacefull> wtf
[00:13] <darthanubis> !language
[00:13] <ubottu> Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
[00:13] <Peacefull> Late response much
[00:14] <Peacefull> oh, sorry, didn't notice that wasn't allowed.
[00:14] <Brando753> guys i keep getting this error when ever i am on ubuntu http://img261.imageshack.us/img261/8703/trackererror.png  What should i do, it keeps popping up no matter what i click
[00:14] <jken146> TopRamen: If you only want to send mail, why not just configure your app to send mail via e.g. smtp.googlemail.com ?
[00:14] <dork_paste> has anyone ported directx 10 to libnux yet?
[00:14] <genii> dork_paste: Try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games
[00:14] <TopRamen> rdove: is that difficult to do?
[00:14] <dork_paste> i've already been there, I said good games
[00:15] <TopRamen> rdove: if I just locked it down to ONLY accept mail being sent from the localhost, would that do it?
[00:15] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  good is a relative term.
[00:15] <dork_paste> Well, I came from windows, so you know something at that level would be good.
[00:15] <Dr_Willis> !find freecol
[00:15] <ubottu> Found: freecol
[00:15] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:   your criteria is rather vague.
[00:15] <lascar> !cedega | dork_paste
[00:15] <mikey_> Hello.
[00:15] <ubottu> dork_paste: cedega is a project based on WINE, aimed at running Windows games on Linux. For more info, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Cedega
[00:15] <Dr_Willis> !info freecol
[00:15] <ubottu> freecol (source: freecol): an open version of Colonization. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.7.4.dfsg+1-1ubuntu1 (jaunty), package size 13153 kB, installed size 20092 kB
[00:15] <Dr_Willis> I spent many an hr playing FreeCol :)
[00:16] <jken146> dork_paste: It depends what you like.  Battle for Wesnoth is not a bad strategy game
[00:16] <Dr_Willis> SavageII is also nifty (comercial game with linux client)
[00:16] <randall_> yo mate
[00:16] <jken146> dork_paste: But if it's Windows games you like, I suggest you check out winehq.org
[00:16] <rdove> TopBunny88 yeah only allow localhost
[00:16] <rdove> TopRamen: yeah only allow localhost
[00:16] <dork_paste> well, like I don't really want to pay, that's why I'm on linux :>
[00:17] <brian___> hey guys, i'm having trouble getting wubi to install ubuntu - anyone think they can help?
[00:17] <randall_> how do i set up a hypercam?
[00:17] <dork_paste> actually I'm really into multiplayer first person shooters
[00:17] <dork_paste> but openarena doesn't quite cut it
[00:17] <rdove> TopRamen: here is a couple tutorials: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5507 -- http://www.wikihow.com/Configure-Sendmail
[00:17] <danielrmt> drok_paste: what about urbanterror?
[00:17] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  urban terror is fragtastic
[00:17] <Dr_Willis> :)
[00:17] <jken146> The Quake people are working on a linux client
[00:17] <TopRamen> rdove: so sendmail will consume much less resources than postifx will?
[00:17] <TopRamen> thanks for your help btw
[00:17] <dork_paste> wait wasn't that an unreal tournament mod that was like bad cs?
[00:18] <Dr_Willis> I liked Urban Terror better then CS.
[00:18] <rdove> TopRamen: theres also a channel dedicated to sendmail on this server, you'd have to join the channel sendmail
[00:18] <dork_paste> HAHAHAHA
[00:18] <Dr_Willis> Trembulus is also popular
[00:18] <dork_paste> CS was like the best game ever though, they've remade it so many times
[00:18] <TopRamen> rdove: ok I'll give it a whirl
[00:18] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:   so go play it then. :)
[00:18] <dork_paste> ugh and tremulous is too easy >_> I played lots of quake 3 andi t's just like ez mode
[00:18] <lascar> dork_paste: naturally.
[00:19] <dork_paste> well, wine doesn't support the remake (Left 4 Dead) so I'm like stuck ad stuff
[00:19] <Dr_Willis> Go get SavageII demo its free for like 3 hrs. :)
[00:19] <rdove> TopRamen: postfix is easier to setup and is more secure
[00:19] <hitos> Isn't Ur-Quan Masters open source?
[00:19] <bhsx> are there some Transmission settings i'm not aware of or is Transmission just terminally slow?  my ports are open, i can access the web interface, but i'm on a torrent that's a top 10 torrent at a certain Bay i know and i only get 14KB down, connected to 14 of 62 peers when there are thousands of seeders and even more leachers....
[00:19] <Dr_Willis> hitos:  yes it is.
[00:19] <bhsx> what's the deal?
[00:19] <UbbyCD> screw amarok
[00:19] <UbbyCD> is there a gtk alternative thats good
[00:19] <dork_paste> i serached for trembulous and i can't find it
[00:19] <Dr_Willis> bhsx:  i dont find transmission slow.
[00:20] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  i never can spell it right..
[00:20] <hitos> Why it is classified as non-free?
[00:20] <Dr_Willis> tremulous?
[00:20] <UbbyCD> how bout rhythmbox is it good or is there a better gtk audio player manager
[00:20] <Dr_Willis> hitos:  the data files may have some restrictions?
[00:20] <TopRamen> rdove: that's what I've heard
[00:20] <TopRamen> rdove: so I'm looking at both
[00:20] <dork_paste> also is there like a link to urban terror/trembulous/SavageII google is pretty hard for me obn linux as a new user i am just very slow do you have any protips for getting fast er at us ign linux fastetr
[00:20] <rdove> TopRamen: i dont know which has better performance
[00:20] <carpediem1> UbbyCD: personally, I like banshee.  But I also like amarok
[00:20] <bhsx> that's cool, but is there a reason why i'm only seeing 62 peers, and why i'm downloading so slowly/
[00:20] <UbbyCD> whats better
[00:20] <danielrmt> UbbyCD: rhythimbox is great, but i prefer quodlibet
[00:20] <dork_paste> wait isn't torrenting illegal!?
[00:21] <UbbyCD> can yall sum up in a few words why you like the ones you like
[00:21] <genii> dork_paste: Only if the content is
[00:21] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  No its not.
[00:21] <UbbyCD> I would really appreciate it
[00:21] <danielrmt> dork_paste: there are legal torrents like ubuntu
[00:21] <UbbyCD> as my laptop is weird
[00:21] <zeusss> hey, my nb monitor is broken, is there an option to disable it in grub?
[00:21] <jken146> dork_paste: no, not per se
[00:21] <BePhantom> hi all, i need some help. i need to format my usb stick to fat32, how do i do it in ubuntu?
[00:21] <UbbyCD> and i dont want to break functionality installing all the different players
[00:21] <danielrmt> BePhantom: do you have gparted installed?
[00:21] <genii> BePhantom: mkfs.vfat
[00:21] <nickgrey147> iam using ubuntu in a VM i edited the /etc/network file to use a static address , but it is still being assigned address dynamicly .. :( ? any ideas
[00:22] <UbbyCD> like why is quodlibet good and ive heard banshee is goos somewhere else too
[00:22] <Dr_Willis> BePhantom:  use gparted is one way.
[00:22] <BePhantom> danielrmt, i think not, dunno
[00:22] <gent_first> hello
[00:22] <Brando753> guys i keep getting this error when ever i am on ubuntu http://img261.imageshack.us/img261/8703/trackererror.png  What should i do, it keeps popping up no matter what i click
[00:22] <BePhantom> genii, mkfs.vfat and what else?
[00:22] <carpediem1> UbbyCD: Banshee has good integration with Last.fm, including scrobbling and a recommendation panel which is awesome.  Also I like the layout.
[00:22] <dork_paste> what's the fastest browser would you guys suggest using IE6 through wine? I think that firefoxfeee ls really slow? how long unti l google chrome gets ported i heard that that is the fastest brwowerser
[00:22] <Dr_Willis>  dork_paste  i would never suggest using IE.
[00:23] <UbbyCD> good enough for me .. Installed
[00:23] <Dr_Willis> i dont find firefox slow at all.. there is opera also dork_paste
[00:23] <dork_paste> I really like what i see from it thoutrh it is much much MUCH faster thatn the natetive versions of firefox on wine for me
[00:23] <darthanubis> dork_paste, you can have chrome now by adding googles repos. I use FF3.5
[00:23] <gent_first> i have ubuntu installed on another parition but i dont have mIRC on it
[00:23] <gent_first> does mIRC work with ubuntu
[00:23] <jken146> dork_paste: firefox on wine??
[00:23] <xcdfgkjhgcv> Rhythmbox is being a MASSIVE CPU hog for me.
[00:23] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  it might work with wine... but theres other irc clients id suggest.
[00:23] <coleys> gent_first: Irssi!!
[00:23] <genii> BePhantom: You might want to change partition type first to some windows kind with a partitioner like gparted as suggested. But otherwise, jst something like: sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdz1          for instance, if your usb stick is registering as sdz
[00:23] <dork_paste> NONONONO like Internet Explorer on Wine it just seems way faster and like there might be way more support for really cool flash websites like newgrounds and stufff
[00:24] <nickgrey147> gent_first: xchat , irssi
[00:24] <gent_first> Dr_Willis: sure, i just want it to be free/open source etc. like mIRC
[00:24] <UbbyCD> so is rhythmbox or banshee better on system resources
[00:24] <coleys> gent_first: mirc is neither free, nor opensource =p
[00:24] <nickgrey147> gent_first: mirc isnt open source
[00:24] <xcdfgkjhgcv> UbbyCD: Rhythmbox is using 20% of my CPU ATM.
[00:24] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  err.. mIRC is not Free/opensourced..  most people use 'xchat'  not 'xchat-gnome'  so try them out
[00:24] <dork_paste> do you really need a real-time curnel to run Frooty Loops effectively or should I just stick to LMMS?!
[00:24] <UbbyCD> thats kinna high
[00:24] <mikey_> <Dr_Willis> how do you install wine?
[00:24] <Dr_Willis> mIRC has some really nasty licensing stuff
[00:24] <lascar> darthanubis: what are the google repos for chrome?
[00:24] <Dr_Willis> mikey_:  in the package manager, or use the winehq versions
[00:24] <dork_paste> I'm afraid you see I have this fear of "RT" "Real Time" and things that have r or t in them in general
[00:24] <jken146> dork_paste: flash works fine under linux IME
[00:24] <carpediem1> UbbyCD: don't know, I would guess rhtythmbox is less resources, but I've never tested.
[00:24] <xcdfgkjhgcv> UbbyCD: It was higher before I disabled Pulseaudio.
[00:24] <Dr_Willis> !wine
[00:24] <ubottu> WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux - More information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine - Search the !AppDB for application compatibility ratings - Join #winehq for application help - See !virtualizers for running Windows (or another OS) inside Ubuntu
[00:24] <dork_paste> what does "repos" mean
[00:25] <nickgrey147> iam using ubuntu in a VM i edited the /etc/network file to use a static address , but it is still being assigned address dynamicly .. ?? any ideas
[00:25] <UbbyCD> yeh and you have to look at that goon everytime you start up the program like hes the god of irc
[00:25] <coleys> lascar: Search google =o You'll find it.
[00:25] <xeer> I am looking for a way to execute a list of commands and re-order their GUI appearance (x,y) once they're loaded.
[00:25] <darthanubis> http://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/ubuntu704.html
[00:25] <jken146> dork_paste: repositories
[00:25] <jken146> !repository
[00:25] <UbbyCD> i hate that piece of crap
[00:25] <ubottu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecommendedSources for the recommended way to set up your repositories
[00:25] <mikey_> <Dr_Willis> thanks
[00:25] <darthanubis> lascar, one google search away
[00:25] <gent_first> well the reason i prefer mIRC as the client is that it's free/open source etc. i never paid for it.
[00:25] <UbbyCD> his picture gets uglier every time i see it. and they make you look at it longer each time too
[00:25] <coleys> gent_first: It isn't free or opensource!!
[00:25] <gent_first> it's also secure, imo
[00:25] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  never paying for it does NOT make it 'free/opensourced'
[00:25] <carpediem1> xeer: you mean like devilspie?
[00:26] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  as for secure.. well.. i recall many bugs with it in the past.
[00:26] <darthanubis> lascar, you can add all types of repos with ubuntutweak
[00:26] <nickgrey147> someone help :P please
[00:26] <dork_paste> are there any search egines that are more efficient on linex? google just feels really slow and like it isn't cutting it, should you suggest using ask when oyu're on linux or like somethign wrreraly good like MetaCrawledr!?
[00:26] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  try out other irc clients.. see what you like.
[00:26] <darthanubis> google ubuntutweak
[00:26] <gent_first> with mIRC u can use ssl. Well anyways, that apart, since mIRC is free/OSS, surely there must be a linux build
[00:26] <gent_first> i dont want to compile it myself
[00:26] <Brando753> guys i keep getting this error when ever i am on ubuntu http://img261.imageshack.us/img261/8703/trackererror.png  What should i do, it keeps popping up no matter what i click
[00:26] <coleys> gent_first: MIRC IS NOT FREE OR OPENSOURCE LOL
[00:26] <jken146> dork_paste: search engine efficiency doesn't change with your OS
[00:26] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  err... for the last time. mIRC is not 'free/OSS'
[00:26] <dork_paste> How do I compile spotlight for ubuntu is there a spotlight repository does anyone have a link?
[00:26] <Brando753> its a tracker applet error, any ideas
[00:27] <gent_first> OK, then why is it available for free?
[00:27] <coleys> gent_first: IT ISNT
[00:27] <dork_paste> I really like the mac spotlight and i want it on linux it worked really good on windows but i just kan't find it for ubutntut
[00:27] <gent_first> ?
[00:27] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  I tend to use xchat in linux and windows.
[00:27] <danielrmt> gent_first: free as in "free speech" is not the same as in "free beer"
[00:27] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  lately i been using irssi and 'znc'
[00:27] <coleys> gent_first: It's a free trial, and its definitly not opensource, cause it's crap. =p
[00:27] <gent_first> Mine is free, it never asks for a licensing free. Only nags for "donation" etc. well that isn't like their asking for a fee
[00:27] <ienorand> gent_first: mirc is proprietary http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC
[00:27] <Dr_Willis> They are asking for a fee..
[00:27] <gent_first> Also, you dont have to 'activate' mIRC or some bs like that..
[00:27] <UbbyCD> any big features banshee has over rhythmbox
[00:27] <jken146> !open_source
[00:27] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about open_source
[00:27] <jken146> !free software
[00:27] <UbbyCD> rhythmbox and banshee look almost the same
[00:27] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about free software
[00:28] <jken146> !free
[00:28] <ubottu> freedom is important. Ubuntu is as free as we can make it, which means mostly free software. See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/licensing
[00:28] <coleys> gent_first: Yeah you do! It's not freeeeee.

[00:28] <dork_paste> are music visualusizers a good I dea? I heard that they can lag down your hloe operating system on windwows?!
[00:28] <dork_paste> I mean ubuntu yeah
[00:28] <dork_paste> that's ubuntu i was talking about in that message
[00:28] <coleys> dork_paste: Depends on graphics card, and ram =)
[00:28] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  anything running/doing things slow down the os a bit...
[00:28] <gent_first> OK, so what' sthe mIRC version for unbuntu. which client
[00:28] <dork_paste> I think it's 6.36
[00:28] <carpediem1> UbbyCD: use them for a while, I don't really feel they are the same, but I think you need to try them and see what you like better.  Banshee is under much heavier development, and I think in another year it will be blowing RB out of the water.
[00:28] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  there is no 'mIRC' for linux. ther eare IRC clients...
[00:28] <dork_paste> I am using mIRC because I really lik
[00:29] <coleys> gent_first: No mIRC for ubuntu... Try xchat, or Irssi
[00:29] <dork_paste> e the scripting environment
[00:29] <dork_paste> it's just much more powerful
[00:29] <Gilou> hi, I have a weird issue that I can't pinpoint easily... sometimes some software will just freeze for some while... those includes xchat, audacious, and gnome-terminal e.g... I suspect it's dbus related..
[00:29] <UbbyCD> thanks great suggestions
[00:29] <dork_paste> thatn any scripting environment that i see whenever i am running IRC
[00:29] <UbbyCD> have a good one
[00:29] <Gilou> sometimes it will bring all gdm down at a point
[00:29] <dork_paste> It 's very good for scripting in IRC, in short.
[00:29] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  its scripting enviroment is rather pathic compared to the  actual languages other irc clients under linux can use.
[00:29] <jken146> !enter
[00:29] <ubottu> Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[00:29] <dork_paste> but ith as if statements what do other scripting envitroentments in irc chat rooms foffer that are much more robust/powerful/portable as if statements?
[00:30] <carpediem1> dork_paste: most CLI irc clients support scripting.  ircii supported it long before mirc existed.
[00:30] <Dr_Willis> Then again.. how much scripting do most people actually need.
[00:30] <dork_paste> I think mirc has goto's too, that's just very very powerful
[00:30] <gent_first> Yeah, you can do the scripts thing with mIRC. there are several scripts available for mIRC. does any client for linux does this
[00:30] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  xchat can do perl, python, and other languages..
[00:30] <coleys> gent_first: YEAH use google lol..
[00:30] <alt_23> can someone help me with compiling c with gcc in ubuntu
[00:30] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  theres numerous  linux irc clients with scripting features.. it depends on your needs.
[00:30] <carpediem1> dork_paste: gotos are your definition of powerful.  Dude, seriously...I give, stick with mIRC
[00:30] <dork_paste> oooh waht other languages? can it do java I really like java in my opinion java is the best scripting language ever
[00:30] <deyvidey> hi
[00:31] <gent_first> coleys: ._. i just said i know there are scripts... why ur telling me to google
[00:31] <jken146> dork_paste: Java is not a scripting language; it's a compiled language
[00:31] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  proberly could. but i wouldent call java a 'scripting' language.
[00:31] <coleys> gent_first: Google will find you whatever you need... i.e. IRC client for Linux
[00:31] <Gilou> ok, my problem just happened.. if anyone has experienced any weird software freezes..
[00:31] <Dr_Willis> !irc | gent_first
[00:31] <ubottu> gent_first: A list of official Ubuntu IRC channels, as well as IRC clients for Ubuntu, can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat - For a general list of !freenode channels, see http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#channellist - See also !Guidelines
[00:31] <gent_first> coleys: there are no installation files
[00:31] <neopsyche_> could anyone help.. please.. i need to enable internet access from my virtual box on this pc.. vbox has ubuntu server installed.. i want to apt-get some things
[00:31] <gent_first> for that
[00:31] <powertool08> Does anyone know how to fix this: $ ncmpc
[00:31] <powertool08> error [11]: problems creating socket
[00:31] <gent_first> Dr_Willis: 404
[00:31] <dork_paste> wait i thought java was a scripted janguage maybe i am thinking of javascript do any of these irc clients work with javascript? I heard that might be the most powerful scripting language ever
[00:32] <dork_paste> have you guys heard of that ruby snke thing with all of the TILDES
[00:32] <dork_paste> do any IRC clients support that
[00:32] <coleys> gent_first: You have nooo clue what you are talking about... =o ... Alt + f2 --> sudo apt-get install xchat (check run in terminal)
[00:32] <Dr_Willis> You can write irc clients in ruby i recall.. and ive seen irc clients written in perl :)
[00:32] <alt_23> when ever i try to compile c in terminal i type in "gcc NAME.c" and then i get no such file or directory
[00:32] <gent_first> dr0pknutz: gimme link
[00:32] <carpediem1> dork_paste: any language that doesnt' have to be compiled before running is considered a scripting language.  Java has to be compiled, Javascript does not.
[00:32] <gent_first> sorry not dr0pknutz
[00:32] <dork_paste> have any of you tried writing a scriptable IRC client withing a scriptable IRC client? that seems like it would be a very definition of power!
[00:32] <gent_first> Dr_Willis: gimme link plz. working
[00:33] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  google.com perhaps?
[00:33] <powertool08> alt_23: I think gcc outputs a.out or something unless you specify the name, try man gcc to see the options
[00:33] <hitos> dork_paste: Java is compiled to run in a virtual machine, the JVM. It creates an abstraction layer between the OS and the java application.
[00:33] <gent_first> Dr_Willis: ok i told u i searched google. their are many clients for linux IRC but nothing like mIRC and certainly no installation files.
[00:33] <alt_23> ok i also try gcc name -o name.c and i get the same
[00:33] <Kungen354646> why wont the sound work in 9,04?
[00:33] <coleys> gent_first: You have nooo clue what you are talking about... =o ... Alt + f2 --> sudo apt-get install xchat (check run in terminal)
[00:33] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  its time you learned some ubuntu/linux basics..  start with the 'ubuntu package manager' docs.
[00:33] <Dr_Willis> !synaptic | gent_first
[00:33] <ubottu> gent_first: synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[00:34] <dork_paste> hitos  that seems like it would be very insceucre i do not know much boubt java but i'd think that virtual machines are dangerors
[00:34] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  you do NOT NOT NOT normally go to  web sites and download 'installer files' for ubuntu apps.
[00:34] <DIL> neopsyche_: ensure that it enabled form details windoe of vbox
[00:34] <alt_23> powertool08 , i try gcc and get "no input files"
[00:34] <dork_paste> is it more efficient to use synaptic or apt-get i don't want to bog down my machine too much
[00:34] <coleys> Dr_Willis: Your so patient kudos to you, haha =)
[00:34] <lstarnes> dork_paste: apt-get or aptitude
[00:34] <neopsyche_> DIL: it is enabled
[00:34] <gent_first> OK. Don't you agree that in order to use an app u have to INSTALL IT?!
[00:34] <neopsyche_> DIL: it doesnt connect
[00:34] <hitos> hitos: Actually, it is safer than a program that is run directly.
[00:34] <lstarnes> gent_first: for most programs, yes
[00:34] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  it dosent matter.  they are the same.
[00:34] <mikey_> <Dr_Willis> would you prefer WINE or VirtualBox?
[00:35] <lascar> darthanubis: I hate ubuntu tweak.
[00:35] <powertool08> alt_23: Sorry, I don't know, I haven't compiled a C program in awhile
[00:35] <Dr_Willis> mikey_:  totally depends on the task you are doing.
[00:35] <alt_23> ok, maybe someone else can help
[00:35]  * bondo689 giggles
[00:35] <dork_paste> but with that user interface isn't theyre a pretty good chance that there are some really good memoery links in the csscripts behind it
[00:35] <darthanubis> lascar, whatever
[00:35] <mikey_> <Dr_Willis> what do you mean?
[00:35] <hitos> Note to self, stop talking to self.
[00:35] <lstarnes> gent_first: but many programs have their own packages for ubuntu, often in ubuntu's own official repositories or launchpad's PPAs
[00:35] <danielrmt> gent_first: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/installingsoftware
[00:35] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  i doubt if thers any memory leaks in programs that are used by 10000000+ users eveyr day.. that stuff gets caught real fast
[00:35] <gent_first> Where to find the whole package for installing irssi
[00:35] <thewrath> when i try to go to  youtube
[00:35] <Dr_Willis> mikey_:  running a whole os = use virtualbox.. one app = try wine
[00:35] <thewrath> and listen i get no sound and forced to restart
[00:36] <coleys> gent_first: Alt + f2 ---> sudo apt-get install irssi (run in terminal)
[00:36] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  its in the package manager under 'irssi' read the irssi.org docs also to learn to use it.
[00:36] <bonhoffer> how do i restartx
[00:36] <darthanubis> lascar, ubuntutweak would have gotten you what you wanted without having to remain ignorant to the google repos
[00:36] <dork_paste> but i thouthg that by fermat's theorem any type of program that outputs to the screenstream must be losing data somwherers
[00:36] <mikey_> <Dr_Willis> ohhh i see, thank you
[00:36] <gent_first> ?
[00:36] <UbbyCD> wow you should of slapped me with a large trout for saying rhythmbox and banshee are the same
[00:36] <dork_paste> or maybe that's nyquists that i am thinking of, like the pixels would lose data and entropize
[00:36] <danielrmt> gent_first: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/installingsoftware
[00:36] <powertool08> bonhoffer: ctrl+alt+bksp will do that
[00:36] <UbbyCD> banshee is amazing
[00:36] <gent_first> i pressed alt+f2 nothing happened
[00:36] <UbbyCD> how do they get the similar artist recommendations?
[00:36] <bonhoffer> powertool08, doesn't work
[00:36] <jtaji> dork_paste and gent_first are a pretty obvious couple of trolls
[00:36] <powertool08> bonhoffer: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart also works
[00:36] <lascar> ubuntu tweak was also responsible for an annoying problem on my notebook.  Thanks, but I'll pass on that piece of code.
[00:37] <coleys> Yeah
[00:37] <dork_paste> ?? what is troll?
[00:37] <coleys> I was kindaaa assuming lol.
[00:37] <UbbyCD> anyone looking for a good media player for ubuntu get banshee NOW!
[00:37] <jvrmrtn> whats program is equivalent like ares in ubuntu ?
[00:37] <Dr_Willis> dork_paste:  go spend an hr+ reading some basic docs/guides then come back...
[00:37] <UbbyCD> pc3 and thanks for suggesting it whoever did
[00:37] <coleys> !troll | gent_first
[00:37] <ubottu> gent_first: trolling / trollish behaviour is behaviour that is considered annoying by other channel users, this includes going offtopic, asking the same question time and again getting answered and not acknowledging the answer, and these are not the only ways behaviour can be considered trolling, please see /msg ubotu guidelines - if this applies to you, you may find yourself outside the channel
[00:37] <Soda2> hi, I'm looking for help
[00:37] <genii> dork_paste: Trolls are unwelcome visitors to irc channels
[00:37] <mikey_> <Dr_Willis> K, i got WINE installed, so how do i run windows apps with it now?
=== JC_Denton__ is now known as JC_Denton_
[00:37] <gent_first> Coldbeer: don't accuse me of doing stuff like trolling.
[00:38] <gent_first> I dont like being wrongly accused.
[00:38] <Soda2> I'm trying to install 9.04 from an iso without burning the iso to a cd
[00:38] <dork_paste> Me neither
[00:38] <Dr_Willis> mikey_:  read the wine wiki pages/docs yet? basjcs.. 'wine /path/to/whatever/program.exe'
[00:38] <alt_23> can someone help with compilng c with gcc?
[00:38] <Kungen354646> why wont the sound work in 9.04?
[00:38] <burntresistor> is it worth upgrading to jaunty?
[00:38] <coleys> gent_first: Read the definintion of trolling, it clearly applies to you. =)
[00:38] <dork_paste> you guys should be nicer to the noobies how do you expect linux to get popular if you accuse us of things like trolling :(
[00:38] <gent_first> So how do u install irssi? I tried alt+f2, nothing happened
[00:38] <lstarnes> Kungen354646: there could be many reasons
[00:38] <powertool08> alt_23: you might want to try #C, its probably less busy
[00:38] <lstarnes> gent_first: open a terminal and type in "sudo apt-get install irssi"
[00:38] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  use the package manger tool
[00:38] <carpediem1> gent_first: use System > Adminstration >Synaptic paackage manager
[00:38] <lascar> Kungen354646: good question!  Sounds ports only to my headphone jack in 9.04
[00:38] <jken146> Soda2: You could use unetbootin to put the iso on a usb stick then install from that
[00:39] <dork_paste> is there any way to bind key shortcuts so that you use <super>+something
[00:39] <coleys> gent_first: Applications > Acessories > Terminal --> sudo apt-get install irssi
[00:39] <alt_23> powertool08, true, i forgot there were other rooms for a sec lol.
[00:39] <lstarnes> Kungen354646: it depends partly on your hardware and sound settings
[00:39] <gent_first> coleys: it DOES NOT apply to me. According to u, anyone who doesnt know as much as u is a troll?!! if this is ur attitude then im not surprized ppl shy away from linux
[00:39] <dork_paste> it's really bugging me i want things to go fast
[00:39] <ienorand> Soda2: that might be tricky, have a usb you  could use?
[00:39] <mikey_> <Dr_Willis> ok, i think i get it
[00:39] <coleys> gent_first: People don't shy away from linux. =p
[00:39] <dork_paste> and <super> seems like the best key to do stuff with
[00:39] <Kungen354646> lstarnes: im having problems with sound in flash it seems
[00:39] <gent_first> coleys: well stop being meen to new ppl
[00:39] <lstarnes> gent_first, coleys: both of you stop this and get back to being on-topic
[00:39] <Dr_Willis> super key is often used by a lot of COmpiz 'features'
[00:39] <burntresistor> is it worth upgrading to 9.04?
[00:39] <jken146> dork_paste: the Keyboard settings thing in Preferences lets you do things like that
[00:39] <Soda2> I don't have a usb or a cd. the main site says to use something like sudo mount -o loop ~/Desktop/ubuntu-9.04-alternate-i386.iso /media/cdrom0
[00:39] <dork_paste> but it doesn't work right
[00:39] <dork_paste> if I try and bind super with anything it doesn't work >(
[00:39] <coleys> lstarnes: I am doing nothing. =/
[00:40] <dork_paste> it's been like this since 7.xx
[00:40] <Soda2> but I can't get anything to work. I've been trying for a couple hours
[00:40] <gent_first> lstarnes: ok.
[00:40] <Kungen354646> lstarnes: i think there is an alsa problem, so ive switched to oss, but flash doesnt support oss or something
[00:40] <gent_first> So how do u install irssi. plz tell me i figgered everthing else in linux except IRC and internet connection
[00:40] <jken146> !install | Soda2
[00:40] <ubottu> Soda2: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation.  Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall - Don't want to use a CD? Try http://tinyurl.com/3exghs - see also !automate
[00:40] <carpediem1> burntresistor: I did an upgrade, and it wasn't working very well, then I did a clean install (since I have a separate home partition) and I have to say a clean 9.04 is phenominal.  Boots in about 22 seconds, runs smooth as silk, very very nice.
[00:40] <jken146> gent_first: sudo apt-get install irssi
[00:40] <iceroot> gent_first: sudo apt-get install irssi
[00:41] <jken146> iceroot: snap!
[00:41] <iceroot> jken146: to slow :)
[00:41] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  run 'synaptic' from the menus.. serach for irssi, install it.. or use the command line given a dozen times so far..
[00:41] <jpangamarca> Hi, can someone tell me if Launchpad is down? It's been several days I've been trying to enter but I can't...
[00:41] <lstarnes> gent_first: I gave you the instructions.  Open a terminal (Applications > accessories > terminal) then enter the command that jken146 and iceroot said to use
[00:41] <danielrmt> jpangamarca: does not look down for me
[00:41] <lstarnes> jpangamarca: launchpad.net works for me
[00:41] <coleys> lstarnes: Which I have also said many times, but he 'refuses to acknowledge the answer'
[00:41] <Roasted> Not to be an idiot, but I have a question - is banshee a gnome-native program?
[00:42] <danielrmt> jpangamarca: you can also use this site in the future: http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/
[00:42] <danielrmt> Roasted: yes
[00:42] <jken146> Roasted: I believe it is
[00:42] <lstarnes> Roasted: I believe it uses gnome libs
[00:42] <LjL> Roasted: i don't actually know, but "apt-cache show banshee" shows a lot of gnome-related dependencies
[00:42] <alt_23> powertool: it says i need a registered username on ##c (redirects from #c)
[00:42] <Roasted> okay, thanks. I always heard a lot about banshee and never touched it cause I liked amarok. AFter seeing what amarok2 brought to the table I knew I had to find something else that was designed with half a brain. Banshee fits the bill but I just wasnt sure if it was gnome or kde.
[00:42] <cads> hello
[00:43] <dork_paste> Do you guys always get this huffy when people are in a frenzy to get their new operating system working? If so, I'm not suprised your market-share is in the red
[00:43] <powertool08> alt_23: hmm, try #bash, they might get annoyed and say you're in the wrong channel, but I bet they'd know
[00:43] <lstarnes> dork_paste: not usually
[00:43]  * lascar goes to try Banshee
[00:43] <Roasted> dork_paste - whats up man?
[00:43] <alt_23> powertool08: k haha ill try it.
[00:43] <Roasted> dork_paste - what do you need help with?
[00:43] <dork_paste> everyone got all angry and started accusing me of being a troll
[00:43] <dork_paste> I just had alot of questions :(
[00:43] <jpangamarca> talk about stupid people
[00:43] <Roasted> dork_paste - I only just now started to watch the chat so I have no idea what happened earlier.
[00:44] <Mikel> hi guys. I have a question. let's say that I do a "vi lala" in the terminal. then I do "stat lala", and my access time isn't updated. any reasons?
[00:44] <coleys> dork_paste: Dork honestly you don't have to take it so personally, just proove your not one. No reason to be upset for being called a troll if your not one =p.
[00:44] <Roasted> dork_paste - I will be the first to admit, these chat rooms are nazi driven, so keep it kindergarten rated in here. The forums however are actually treated with a human-being manner.
[00:44] <aoeui> Mikel: is the partition mounted with noatime?
[00:44] <Yanick_> hi, how do I configure NetworkManager not to ask me for a password when booting Ubuntu?
[00:44] <Roasted> dork_paste - what were your questions though? Maybe I can help.
[00:44] <Dr_Willis> when you get 2000+ people in a chat room you MUST keep a tight rein on it.
[00:44] <iceroot> Yanick_: using an empty keyword for keyring-manager if you are using auto-login
[00:45] <Mikel> noatime? excuse my I'm quite of a newb so I don't know. But my modification time seems to be working fine
[00:45] <Roasted> dr_willis - there's a line, I understand, but theres a tight line with THIS particular room, and I'm not the only one who sees it.
[00:45] <dork_paste> STICK YOUR PENIS IN MY PENIS
[00:45] <bonhoffer> what is x11?
[00:45] <cdavis> wtf
[00:45] <coleys> Thats why he's a troll =p
[00:45] <Dr_Willis> Roasted:  then ya get people that just feel like being rude....
[00:45] <hitos> What does the '0' in "chmod 01777" mean? Is it different from "chmod 1777"?
[00:45] <gent_first> The only thing thats stopping me from deleting windows and using linux all the way is lack of mIRC and internet dosent work
[00:45] <Yanick_> iceroot: so, an empty entry in the "Password and encryption Keyrings" will be used as default?
[00:45] <lstarnes> bonhoffer: it's the display server protocol used by the x window system and its servers like Xorg
[00:46] <mac94161> I've got the feeling dork_paste was asking for it.
[00:46] <Dextl> For the life of me, I can't figure out how to find out how much space I have left on my disk.  Can anyone help me?
[00:46] <gent_first> hitos: probably 0 or 1 is the name of compute if ur using different computers at the same time or sumth
[00:46] <jpangamarca> better shut up when not having something good to say
[00:46] <Dr_Willis> gent_first:  there are other irc clients.. go test them out.. or run mIRC in wine if you must hafve mIRC
[00:46] <coleys> gent_first: Mirc is one of many irc clients... lol... its ugly.
[00:46] <cdavis> Dextl: df -h
[00:46] <Dextl> thanks
[00:46] <carpediem1> he may be asking for it, but people are being awful rude to people with questions lately.
[00:46] <danielrmt> gent_first: to install any software in ubuntu, open applications > add/remove. then search for xchat
[00:46] <burntresistor> i heard on some threads that compiz wanst working right on new installs for 9.04 is that true or is it most likley those peopel just upgraded
[00:46] <bonhoffer> lstarnes, interesting, so display protocol -- converts OS commands into monitor code
[00:47] <danielrmt> gent_first: you can see more about installing softaware in ubuntu in http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/installingsoftware
[00:47] <bonhoffer> kind of like openGL?
[00:47] <Roasted> anybody have video tearing with nvidia in 904?
[00:47] <jpangamarca> anyway...
[00:47] <cdavis> Is compbiz installed by default in 9.04?
[00:47] <bonhoffer> what would the windows equiv of x11 be?
[00:47] <Dr_Willis> Roasted:  ive not seen the issue on my 8800gtsxxx and the 180 drivers
[00:47] <carpediem1> Roasted: nope.  I am noticing tearing when using the new ATI open source driver, but not nvidia
[00:47] <lstarnes> bonhoffer: windows explorer
[00:47] <ksa> hi
[00:47] <coleys> cdavis: Yeah, for effects ... sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
[00:47] <cdavis> bonhoffer: explorer.exe
[00:47] <Dr_Willis> bonhoffer:  there is none.. You can install xming to get 'X' in windows
[00:47] <Roasted> dr_willis - I have 180 drivers with a 9600GT... tearing...
[00:47] <gent_first> why internet dosent work with ubuntu
[00:47] <ksa> what is the madwifi version that works on vmlinuz-2.6.28-11-generic ?
[00:47] <lstarnes> bonhoffer: nit's used as a window display and manipulation system
[00:48] <lstarnes> *it's
[00:48] <ksa> i've some compilation problem
[00:48] <bonhoffer> o.k. hold on -- so i thought x11 what the display protocol not the windows system
[00:48] <Roasted> not as bad as intrepid, but, still existent
[00:48] <carpediem1> gent_first: please be more specific, how are you connecting to the internet?  wireless?
[00:48] <mib_0bq0hunh> hi Im new to ubuntu and I am having problems with my wireless keyboard and mouse. they work for a while and after the they froze and the only way to get it working again is to rebooted the computer
[00:48] <bonhoffer> so i would see metacity --> explorer.exe
[00:48] <Dr_Willis> Roasted:  describe exactly what you mean by 'tearing' ive never noticed it.
[00:48] <lstarnes> bonhoffer: it's the protocol used by the window syste,
[00:48] <cdavis> gent_first: it does for me. What type of interface are you using?
[00:48] <lstarnes> *system
=== carpediem1 is now known as carpediem
[00:48] <Kungen354646> argh! what is wrong with alsa??
[00:48] <georgep> I have about 300 files i need to unzip all in one folder, is there a command to unzip all zip files from a command line?
[00:49] <bonhoffer> lstarnes, yes, the protocol, not the system itself
[00:49] <gluonman> Every time I turn on my laptop, my system settings are all reset. If I set a new wallpaper, or a new windows theme, the next time I boot, it's all back to 9.04 defaults.
[00:49] <muellisoft> georgep: unzip
[00:49] <bonhoffer> so what display protocol does windows use?
[00:49] <carpediem> georgep: unzip
[00:49] <powertool08> georgep: unzip *.zip
[00:49] <Dr_Willis> georgep:  are the actual ZIP files ? if so   -->  unzip '*.zip'
[00:49] <Dr_Willis> georgep:  watch out for the quotes.
[00:49] <Roasted> dr_willis - pop a DVD in and watch an action scene. If you see a ripple at any point, or a line, particularly horizontally, thats what I mean.
[00:49] <BilokShem> who wants to lick my asshole?
[00:49] <georgep> thanks all
[00:49] <coleys> lol
[00:49] <lingame22> so I want to look at a whole lot of porn on my new Ubuntu install, how do I keep my wife from finding all of it?
[00:49] <Dr_Willis> Roasted:  i rarely watch actual dvd's :)
[00:49] <DIL> dang!!
[00:49] <BilokShem> its hairy and dirty
[00:50] <powertool08> lingame22: password it
[00:50] <jken146> !permissions | lingame
[00:50] <ubottu> lingame: An explanation of what file permissions are and how they can be manipulated can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions
[00:50] <BilokShem> and brown and wrinkled
[00:50] <lingame22> well we only want to have one account I have to keep it like a secret
[00:50] <mac94161> BilokShem, watch your subject matter.
[00:50] <Roasted> dr_willis - heres a picture I took watching a music video in VLC http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y36/Roasted/?action=view&current=SlashGuitarII.png
[00:50] <Dr_Willis> lingame22:  make a 2nd account.. takes all of 10 sec.
[00:50] <Roasted> dr_willis - look at his chest area
[00:50] <lingame22> but she'll know about it then
[00:50] <jken146> lingame22: make another account just for you
[00:50] <lingame22> she's pretty bright she'll look at the logs
[00:50] <panfist> whats a good shell IRC client to use within GNU screen
[00:50] <gluonman> lingame22, how savvy is your wife with Ubuntu? Does she know that you can make your porn hidden files by placing a period in front of it? If not, she won't know to look.
[00:50] <coleys> panfist: Irssi
[00:50] <powertool08> lingame22: add a . in front of the filename and its hidden, unless you have show hidden files turned on
[00:50] <homerj> I've got an issue with keyboard mapping, I'm on an iBook G4, I swap ctrl and caps lock, xev says they are swapped, but ctrl doesn't actually work
[00:51] <lingame22> she's used it a whole lot more than I have
[00:51] <panfist> thanks
[00:51] <Dr_Willis> Roasted:  i even see such things in windows.. i rarely notice them.. :)
[00:51] <a|3x> i am trying to install ubuntu 9.04 and i can't figure out how to set up system disk encryption (it used to be in text installer in 8 but its seems to be gone in 9)
[00:51] <cdavis> lingame22: install virtualbox and truecrypt all of the files
[00:51] <Roasted> dr_willis - *shrug* I dont get it in vista on the same machine.
[00:51] <lingame22> "install": see, that would leave logs
[00:51] <Roasted> dr_willis - I have seen it in windows though too
[00:51] <Linuz2009> what's a abrowser?
[00:51] <Roasted> Question - When I right click a song, go to properties, then the "Audio" tab on the far right, theres stats about the song track.... how can I edit this information?
[00:51] <cdavis> a|3x: whole disk encrytion is only available via the alternate install disk
[00:52] <ballcutter> screen scscfgkosdmncywe 3 p owe'f9wtf
[00:52] <ballcutter> screen -r
[00:52] <lingame22> I can't hide anything from her, I kinda want to look at like redtube, xtube, and *chan but like I can't clear the history either
[00:52] <lingame22> I might have to just not use linux if you guys can't help me solve this :(
[00:52] <a|3x> cdavis, ah, thanks
[00:52] <lstarnes> Linuz2009: a browser?
[00:52] <lingame22> in fact I'm kinda getting there right now
[00:52] <Dr_Willis> Roasted:  i do tend to run dual monitors or monitor + tv out. :)  but i rarely notice it. may be i always watch anime so its not as noticeable
[00:52] <lingame22> hurry >_>
[00:52] <gluonman> lingame22, buy an external harddrive and keep your porn on there and just mount it when you're ready to do your thing.
[00:52] <ksa> no one uses madwifi? :(
[00:52] <mib_0bq0hunh> hi Im new to ubuntu and I am having problems with my wireless keyboard and mouse. they work for a while and after then they froze and the only way to get it working again is to rebooted the computer
[00:52] <Linuz2009> a program called abrowser
[00:52] <tha_infamous> i have windows and ubuntu so when i trn on my comp i have opcion windows ubuntu and something more from ubuntu how can i clear so thet i can only have a opsion window or ubuntu? anyone hellp?
[00:52] <genii> Linuz2009: For internet, browser s are like Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. For files browsers are like Nautilus, Windows Explorer ,etc
[00:52] <georgep> unzip *.zip returned caution: filename not matched: filename file.zip
[00:52] <lstarnes> lingame22: you could install a second browser or use a second user account
[00:52] <lingame22> tha_infamous: google it
[00:52] <lingame22> I can't do that
[00:52] <mikey_> <Dr_Willis> virtualbox wont let me start a new OS
[00:52] <Linuz2009> I know what's a browser
[00:52] <lingame22> she'll look at the logs
[00:52] <Dr_Willis> georgep:  i said use quotes...
[00:53] <georgep> sorry
[00:53] <Linuz2009> the program called ABrowser.
[00:53] <jken146> lingame22: If she has sudo rights there's no way you can stop her from finding anything
[00:53] <lingame22> is there anyway to crapflood the logs?
[00:53] <lingame22> so it gets like wiped and i can just say we got hacked. linux is pretty insecure right?
[00:53] <Linuz2009> like if I remove firefox it'll turn into abrowser
[00:53] <neopsyche> could anyone help.. please.. i need to enable internet access from my virtual box on this pc.. vbox has ubuntu server installed.. i want to apt-get some things
[00:53] <cdavis> lingame22: sounds like you need to buy a mac mini and hide it in your underwear drawer
[00:53] <powertool08> lingame22: What are you going to do when she finds this convo in her logs? You know it is posted online...
[00:53] <tha_infamous> i cant faund
[00:54] <lingame22> there aren't any logs in this program
[00:54] <Dr_Willis> neopsyche:  virtualbox under windows.. running ubuntu?

[00:54] <neopsyche> Dr_Willis: Yes.
[00:54] <lingame22> RIGHT NOW
[00:54] <PhotoJim> Linuz2009: the best answer really is... don't do it.  if you must... then either accept that you will eventually get caught, or divorce now so you can do it freely.  keeping secrets from your spouse is never a great way to engender trust.
[00:54] <lingame22> HURRY PLEASE >_>
[00:54] <cdavis> lingame22: Oh, I have the answer. Go to the book store and look at Playboy.

[00:54] <cipher42> if i do a modprobe for firmware, do i only have to run it once?
[00:55] <cipher42> or at every boot
[00:55] <coleys> PhotoJim: He's probably a teenager =p
[00:55] <lingame22> but i really really really need to look at porn, and she really really really doesn't need to know about it. porn is so important to me right now and if linux can't provide me with secretive porn, i'm just going to have to stop using this junk.

[00:55] <DIL> lingame22: then stop
[00:55] <PhotoJim> lingame22: you should use Windows then.
[00:55] <panfist> wait...
[00:56] <panfist> linux can provide secret anything, way more than windows
[00:56] <lingame22> so you agree that linux is junk?
[00:56] <coleys> Feels like a bunch of trolls tonight, lol...
[00:56] <Linuz2009> does the panel have a weather report?
[00:56] <Dr_Willis> coleys:  i agree

[00:56] <PhotoJim> lingame22: Linux isn't junk.  But you think it is.  and it's your computer.  So good luck!
[00:56] <lstarnes> lingame22: saying stuff like that is not how you get assistance
[00:56] <mac94161> lingame22: I wonder if maybe a subject change is in order?

[00:56] <carpediem> cipher42: add it to /etc/modules
[00:56] <hitos> Anybody knows if "chmod 01777" is different from "chmod 1777"?
[00:56] <Dr_Willis> neopsyche:  only things ive ever had to do for networking was congiure the os in virtualbox to use dhcp. and it works.
[00:56] <coleys> lingame22: A girlfriend is not your left hand. =(
[00:56] <Dr_Willis> hitos:   i dont think it is
[00:56] <cipher42> yea that's the thing, i don't want it to get run
[00:56] <neopsyche> Dr_Willis: how do i do that?
[00:57] <lingame22> well of course my left hand would know
[00:57] <lstarnes> lingame22: just use a second browser or delete things from the history manually
[00:57] <cipher42> but it still does somehow
[00:57] <powertool08> cipher42: I think the file is rc.mod or something
[00:57] <panfist> i'm trying to set up a secure and easy ssh connection to my ubuntu machine from the outside world
[00:57] <lingame22> but my girlfriend might know
[00:57] <lingame22> i can't install another browser, that's logged >_>

[00:57] <Soda2> still trying to install 9.04 from the iso without burning it to a cd
[00:57] <panfist> lingame22 get a better girlfriend that watches porn, and use linux. win-win
[00:57] <Dr_Willis> neopsyche:  with the network config icon at the top right..  but last time i did ubuntu in virtualbox i think it defaulted to dhcp anyway
[00:57] <lstarnes> lingame22: then maybe you need a different girlfriend
[00:57] <cdavis> panfist: are you having problems?
[00:57] <genii> carpediem: Apologies, wrong nick
[00:57] <gluonman> lingame22, is your girlfriend really so paranoid that if you installed, say, galeon and then uninstalled it she would automatically deduce it was for porn?
[00:57] <marksman> I have two network adapters on seperate LANs is it possible to specify which internet connection a specific program should use?
[00:57] <genii> lingame22: : Install linux on a usb stick. Boot and surf from it. When done put the usb stick somewhere safe. etc
[00:57] <powertool08> Does anyone know how to fix this: $ ncmpc error [11]: problems creating socket
[00:57] <mac94161> I wonder if lingame22 is breaking ANY rules?
[00:58] <panfist> cdavis i'm trying to make sure it's secure, i heard about people using special encryption keys they store on a thumb drive
[00:58] <pisecx> guys, cron task * * * * * should be runned every minute?
[00:58] <genii> mac94161: Pornography and secrecy aren't illegal
[00:58] <Dr_Willis> mac94161:  proberly is.
[00:58] <iceroot> pisecx: yes
[00:58] <panfist> cdavis or how to configure to use secure passphrases etc
[00:58] <coleys> lingame22: You need a new girlfriend that doesn't control your life lol  =p
[00:58] <Dr_Willis> but it could be to get around the work stuff. :)
[00:58] <lingame22> So you guys think that a LiveCD is probably a good way to do exactly what I am asking about? XD
[00:58]  * DIL has been wondering about linegane22 also
[00:58] <pisecx> iceroot: I have added it using crontab -e, but got nothing, where can I have a look at log?
[00:58] <cdavis> panfist: you want to go read about authorized_keys or just use a very good password
[00:58] <gluonman> lingame22, you could use the liveCD. That'll work.
[00:58] <lingame22> XD XD XD
[00:58] <panfist> cdavis right now i'm using ssh to log into my new ubuntu machine on my own subnet, behind my router, but i want to secure it so i can log in from work, or maybe even have the ubuntu box on a dmz
[00:59] <genii> lingame22: Since nothing is saves when you use livecd, yes
[00:59] <iceroot> pisecx: post your complet cron-line
[00:59] <mac94161> No one said lingame22 is breaking any laws.
[00:59] <lingame22> ok so I  am glad that a Live CD is a good idea
[00:59] <pisecx> iceroot: * *  *   *   *     /home/z/temp/test.sh
[00:59] <panfist> cdavis what about stuff like intrusion detection, like does a basic ubuntu box do anything special if it thinks that someone is trying to brute force their way in?
[00:59] <coleys> haha #ubuntu is jokes tonight lol
[00:59] <lingame22> tru
[00:59] <cipher42> how do i get the mod to stop running at startup?
[00:59] <coleys> Is today like.. troll day?
[01:00] <Dr_Willis> coleys:  yes it seems that way.
[01:00] <powertool08> panfist: use pubkey authentication with a strong password, change the keys as often as you feel necessary, keep the box patched, turn off any services you aren't using, secure the ones you are.
[01:00] <jtaji> coleys: well there's no school on the weekends
[01:00] <mac94161> coleys, it's like the wild west.
[01:00] <pisecx> iceroot: of course, I tried ./test.sh before
[01:00] <cdavis> panfist: if you port forward only port 22 to your linux box, make sure root is not allowed ssh access and set a good password on your account you should be ok. Of course keeping up with security updates is a must
[01:00] <neopsyche> Dr_Willis: is there a way to force dhcp? im not sure where you are talking about
[01:00] <iceroot> pisecx: * * * * * sh /home/z/temp/test.sh  or * * * * * cd /home/z/temp/ && ./test.sh
[01:00] <powertool08> panfist: also look into 'denyhosts'
[01:00] <mac94161> coleys, we need sheriff Dillon.
[01:00] <xcdfgkjhgcv> lingame22: Are you trolling?
[01:00] <pisecx> iceroot: thanks
[01:00] <lingame22> so, are there any good water boarding games for linux?
[01:00] <iceroot> pinnerup: np
[01:00] <panfist> do i need to look into snort or is that overkill?
[01:01] <mac94161> lingame22 is bordering on trolling.
[01:01] <coleys> mac94161: yeah basicallyyy
[01:01] <mrwes> lingame22, have you tried gitmoforyou?
[01:01] <Dr_Willis> neopsyche:  network settings stuff..  you can configure dhcp or a static ip.  dhcp always works for me on most every distro under virtualbox
[01:01] <panfist> if i can wrap my head around securing ubuntu behind myfirewall, i eventually want ubuntu to -be- my firewall
[01:01] <Dr_Willis> neopsyche:  unless you dont have a nic enabled in the vbox settings
[01:01] <panfist> or some other linux based firewall
[01:01] <coleys> Ill be back later, pce people =)
[01:01] <mod34> help
[01:01] <DIL> dork_paste reincarnated
[01:01] <cdavis> panfist: In my opinion that would be overkill if all you were doing was ssh
[01:01] <lingame22> what do you need help with mod34 ?
[01:02] <jtaji> DIL: exactly
[01:02] <cdavis> panfist: I would say install shorewall
[01:02] <cipher42> i need help!
[01:02] <panfist> cdavis well it's a start. i'm learning.
[01:02] <genii> lingame22: We'll advise you on how to avoid your girlfriend finding out about your secrfet porn life, etc. But please try not to stir up trouble on purpose here for no reason. Good way to get booted.
[01:02] <cipher42> can't get a mod to stop loading at startup!
[01:02] <panfist> cdavis ssh i figure is a good place to start beause you can tunnel a lot of things through ssh
[01:02] <lingame22> which mod isn't loading whenever you start up?
[01:02] <mrwes> genii, do you know what water boarding is?
[01:02] <cdavis> panfist: yes you can.
[01:02] <cipher42> no it IS
[01:02] <cipher42> and i want it to stop
[01:02] <mac94161> I wish lingame22 would just cuss so he'll get kicked.
[01:02] <cipher42> it's for my tuner card

[01:03] <lingame22> I can't kick anyone?
[01:04] <gluonman> For some strange reason, every time I boot up 9.04 on my laptop, it automatically resorts to all out-of-box defaults. Default wallpaper, default windows borders, etc. The only things that I change that stay put after a reboot are the panels. Even my browser can't remember any passwords or anything after a restart. This has been happening ever since I created another user and switched user to this one that's messing up like this.

[01:08] <muellisoft> georgep: apt-get remove
[01:08] <gluonman> Dr_Willis, alright.
[01:08] <genii> xcdfgkjhgcv: Soon, I'm sure
[01:08] <georgep> thanx
[01:08] <MighMoS> georgep: apt-get remove [name]
[01:09] <MighMoS> you can also add --purge if you want to delete its configuration files, too
[01:09] <Roasted> with MP3 ID tags using Audio Tag Tool in Ubuntu, what's the difference between ID3 v1 and ID3 v2?
=== negerboll is now known as Nord
=== Nord is now known as Nord_
[01:10] <muellisoft> MighMoS: of course georgep will read the man page carefully now, because he doesn't wnat to run commands he doesn't know ;-)
[01:10] <muellisoft> Roasted: the version
[01:10] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Google "rhythmbox hog cpu"
[01:10] <gluonman> Dr_Willis, does that happen after you switch users?
[01:10] <marksman> I have 2 NICs and 2 IPs (eth0=10.0.x.x & wlan0=192.168.x.x).  Is it possible to specify that firefox uses eth0 and another application uses wlan0?
[01:10] <MighMoS> I've google searched and apparently Jaunty was blocked for a while, but I still can't upgrade. Anything I should check or do?
[01:10] <Roasted> muellisoft - I'm just trying to get my music library kind of universal with how its organized and Ive been delting version 2. I wasnt sure if that was a stupid thing for me to do or not.
[01:10] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: I've been doing that but all I see is 100% and 99% CPU problems.
[01:10] <muellisoft> marksman: depends on the application. Most apps take --interface or -I to specify the interface to run on.
[01:11] <Dr_Willis> gluonman:   so if you go back to the first user it does save changes?  Try adding a 3rd user  and see if it affectgs them.. It could be permission issues on the users home dirs.
[01:11] <Soda2> I don't understand this linux crap at all. this must be how idiots feel when they sit at a computer. I have no idea what I'm doing or how I'm supposed to do it
[01:11] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Well, I saw a 10% issue, but no one had an answer.
[01:11] <marksman> muellisoft: awesome will look into that thanks!
[01:11] <muellisoft> Roasted: id3v2 is quite old so everything knows how to deal with it. So go with it :)
[01:11] <genii> Soda2: Everyone was new at it once. Have heart
[01:11] <Dr_Willis> Soda2:  'crawl, walk, run' :)
[01:11] <Roasted> muellisoft - Ive been deleting v2 though... and keeping v1.... ha??
[01:11] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: I'm using an Intel Atom CPU but I don't think Rhythmbox should be using as much as 20% of it.
[01:11] <dillard> hello
[01:12] <muellisoft> marksman: but I highly suspect that you can make firefox make connectinos from a specified device ;-) But if you have luck, tell me :)
[01:12] <gluonman> Dr_Willis, I have 4 users. All users have full permissions. I switched from one user to the other one, and the one I switched into restored system settings defaults and can't seem to keep any changes since.
[01:12] <AdiePutera> can i make cpanel on ubuntu 8.04 using console ?
[01:12] <muellisoft> Roasted: if you're fine with id3v1, then go with it :) It's not that flexible though. but you know that of course.
[01:12] <dillard> ok can anyone help im using a nivida geforce 6200 on ubuntu 9.04 and the damn drivers want activate only one driver at a time will
[01:12] <genii> Soda2: When you get something new, a good thing is to read the user manual for it. Same sort of princile applies. Also you have here to ask questions for which you can find no immediate answer
[01:12] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Well, that's not very powerful... Have you tried updating?
[01:12] <Dr_Willis> gluonman:  so this affects one user only? not the other 3?
[01:12] <gluonman> Dr_Willis, every time a restart will cause it to go back to it's out-of-box look, except for the panels.
[01:12] <DIL> Soda2: in addition try http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-to-mount-iso-image-under-linux.html
[01:12] <powertool08> gluonman: Its probably not the problem, but maybe check if you have session saving enabled and disable it?
[01:12] <gluonman> Dr_Willis, so far, it's affected 2 of my users.
[01:13] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: Intel Atom is more powerful than most CPUs made in the last 30 years.
[01:13] <gluonman> powertool08, I was thinking that too, but it's not the problem.
[01:13] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: I'm using the latest version of Ubunty.
[01:13] <xcdfgkjhgcv> s/Ubunty/Ubuntu/
[01:13] <Roasted> Is there any way to force Banshee to not use the ID tags for music? I just want it to sort by band names... I have like 13 folders of "Candlebox" cause when I got the music, some of the tags for the music were - Candlebox, Canndlebox, candlebox, candleboxx, etc... so I have all of those folders in Banshee created and I haaaaaate it.
[01:13] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Oh, my. I thought it was a laptop CPU? I'm behind the curb...
[01:14] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: It's a "Netbook" CPU.
[01:14] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: I mean have you updated the rhythmbox package?
[01:14] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: But it's reasonably powerful.
[01:14] <Dr_Willis> I find my netbook to be quite speedy with its atom cpu :)
[01:14] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: I'm using the latest Rhythmbox version in Jaunty.
[01:14] <MighMoS> How do I work around update-manager and do-release upgrade telling me "No new release found"?
[01:14] <genii> marksman: You can have only one default gateway. So not really possible to specify interface in Firefox since it uses whatever networking set up as the gateway, and has no specific facility to speficy what adater or so on to use
[01:14] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: I've apt-get updated and upgraded today.
[01:14] <MighMoS> (Running Intrepid 64-bit server)
[01:14] <xcdfgkjhgcv> Dr_Willis: It should be.
[01:15] <gluonman> Dr_Willis, there have been a couple times that I booted and the gdesklets I had placed on my desktop a previous session (not necessarily the immediately previous session) came up.
[01:15] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Drat, that doesn't leave much to go on. You've of course checked to see if that's the only program taking CPU?
[01:15] <gluonman> Dr_Willis, and if I go to the startup applications, whatever new applications I enter there are still there.
[01:15] <AdiePutera> how to config php using ssh ?
[01:15] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: No.
[01:15] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: What do you mean?
[01:15] <muellisoft> AdiePutera: what?!
[01:16] <AdiePutera> i need help
[01:16] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: Rhythmbox is the biggest CPU hog on my system by far.
=== yacc_ is now known as yacc
[01:16] <muellisoft> AdiePutera: then please help us helping you. please elaborate on your problem.
[01:16] <AdiePutera> i cant setup webserver using ssh
[01:16] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Well, I've had a "trackerd" program taking up half my CPU and I had no idea why. Did you look in system monitor to make sure that's the hogging process?
[01:16] <ryanakca> Is it possible to split a .flac and a .ape into ``tracks'' if I have the .cue file associated with each?
[01:16] <MaT-dg> how do I enable the expose effect in compiz?
[01:16] <Mion> ryanakca: yes
[01:16] <marksman> genii: but I am able to access both internal pages in the routers, so that would mean that it is properly identifying which device to use based on ip
[01:16] <muellisoft> AdiePutera: I don't understand your problem. What do you want to achieve?
[01:17] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: Yes.
[01:17] <ryanakca> Mion: What should I google for?
[01:17] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: Of course.
[01:17] <AdiePutera> muellisoft : i want create webserver
[01:17] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: CPU time is off the chart.
[01:17] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Drat.
[01:17] <muellisoft> AdiePutera: then do it!
[01:17] <Mion> ryanakca: look at the doom9 forum
[01:17] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: gnome-system-monitor is equally CPU intensive though.
[01:17] <Mion> s/look/search/
[01:17] <genii> marksman: You could try some tactic like specifying a proxy to firefox on port 80 of the gateway which is the specific adapter you want to use
[01:17] <AdiePutera> muellisoft : everytime im try to make it.. its show nothing
[01:17] <Soda2> ok, I guess I'm gonna have to install each of the upgrades manually
[01:17] <mib_d6gbq3> expose is super+e last time i checked
[01:18] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: s/equally/half\ as/
[01:18] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: True. But you can look at the individual process's CPU usage.
[01:18] <muellisoft> AdiePutera: it's a pain to help you :( Can you please be precise and clear about a) what you've done, b) what happend and c) what you've expected instead.
[01:18] <jon_high9000> hi. is there anyone who how to work with iptables i need help and have some questions.
[01:18] <marksman> genii: The goal is equally two parts:  maintain all web traffic on wired, and only allow torrent traffic on wireless
[01:18] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: Of course, that's what I'm doing.
[01:19] <MarkJones> I was just wondering is it a common problem that the NVIDIA GLX and official NVIDIA drivers both cause system lock ups and other such problems? Ive never had any luck as far as reliability with either on my last 2 PCs.Is this common? Im about to just ditch the drivers and compiz altogether just do i have a reliable system.
[01:19] <muellisoft> jon_high9000: there probably is ;-) how 'bout just asking your question? :)
[01:19] <cdavis> jon_high9000: many of us will try to help.
[01:19] <AdiePutera> muellisoft : i just bought the vps yesterday and install ubuntu 8.04 LTS
[01:19] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Yeah, I figured you were. It's got me stumped.
[01:19] <AdiePutera> how can i make webserver go online
[01:19] <Sebboh> Hi.  My grub is screwed up.  I'd like to boot off the Ubuntu live CD to fix this.  (It's the only bootable linux CD I have.)  Then what do I do?  I tried mounting the filesystems on the hard drive and using chroot then running update-grub.  Was that what I was supposed to try?
[01:19] <AdiePutera> im trying to follow step by step.. but its fail
[01:20] <muellisoft> AdiePutera: I urge you to read the documentation.
[01:20] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: I'm going to disable the crossfading engine and see if it helps at all.
[01:20] <genii> marksman: Hm No easy way I can think of for that, sorry
[01:20] <muellisoft> Sebboh: sounds good
[01:20] <MighMoS> Sebboh: you have to chroot to your mounted partititon before running update-grub
[01:20] <cdavis> AdiePutera: what do you mean "Go Online"? You can start apache by typing /etc/init.d/apache2 start
[01:20] <jon_high9000> is there a faster way to learn how to work with iptables? i am a newbie.
[01:20] <AdiePutera> muellisoft : can i paste the error code in here ?
[01:20] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Oh, yeah, I once had that on and it kept locking up. Probably buggy.
[01:20] <gluonman> Dr_Willis, any ideas? I'm sure it's my fault because I sometimes use that laptop to try out a bunch of experimental software. And if the fix for all of its problems is just too much complicated work, I'll end up re-installing. But I'm still curious to know what's causing the problem.
[01:20] <MighMoS> Sebboh: mount /dev/HARDDRIVE /mnt; chroot /mnt; update-grub
[01:20] <Dr_Willis> MarkJones:  ive no issues with the nvidia drivers on my 3 nvidia systems..  a lot just depends on the chipset i think
[01:20] <muellisoft> AdiePutera: better use pastebin.ca or smth like that
[01:20] <cdavis> AdiePutera: if it is one line
[01:20] <TX-Dan> Can anyone tell me how to see who is actively connected to my machine through SSH? In addition, is there any software to show it in a consistent fashion? I don't want to issue a command everytime I want to see if someone is connected.
[01:21] <MarkJones> Dr_Willis: hmm ok
[01:21] <Dr_Willis> gluonman:  hard to tell. other then user permissions on the home dir. i cant think of anything.
[01:21] <powertool08> TX-Dan: use "w"
[01:21] <mrwes> TX-Dan, w
[01:21] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: No difference.
[01:21] <genii> marksman: You may want to ask in #ubuntu-server , they have some knowledgable networking fellows in there. Don't get discouraged if they scoff at you for running a desktop environment ;)
[01:21] <muellisoft> MighMoS: Sebboh told us, that he'd chrooted his system :)
[01:21] <AdiePutera> its show like this apache2: Syntax error on line 185 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.load: Cannot load /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so into server: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: undefined symbol: gzopen64
[01:21] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: Actually, it's using slightly less CPU I think.
[01:21] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Gee, that stinks. IDK.
[01:21] <cdavis> TX-Dan: You could so something like "watch 'ps auxf|grep ssh'"
[01:21] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: 17-18% CPU
[01:21] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: That's good.
[01:22] <MarkJones> Maybe ill revert back to the LTS release and see if its more stable there.
[01:22] <mrwes> TX-Dan, or tail -f /var/log/auth.log
[01:22] <AdiePutera> im totally new
[01:22] <Sebboh> mightymos, that's what I did, hold on lemme do the same again and type up the error message I get in a pastebin.  muellisoft, yep. one sec.
[01:22] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: :-P
[01:22] <marksman> genii: I appreciate all your help
[01:22] <TX-Dan> powertool08, "w" ?
[01:22] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: 13%
[01:22] <MighMoS> Sebboh: Sorry about that.
[01:22] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Going down...
[01:22] <mrwes> TX-Dan, yah...just 'w'
[01:22] <gluonman> Dr_Willis, alright. Well, thank you anyway. I'm just going to re-install.
[01:22] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Maybe restart it?
[01:22] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: It's fluctuating between 13% and 18%
[01:22] <dawson> Hi guys, I'm having a problem with mplayer, I'm getting this error: mplayer: error while loading shared libraries: libartsc.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[01:22] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: I did.
[01:22] <MighMoS> Sebboh: It'd also be nice to know how grub is screwed up
[01:22] <powertool08> TX-Dan: its a command to give you info on logged in users
[01:22] <genii> marksman: No problem. If you find a suitable solution, return to tell us, will assist others who read IRC logs :)
[01:22] <mrwes> TX-Dan, from ther terminal type just w
[01:22] <MighMoS> (Even if its just "Error 17" or w/e)
[01:22] <dawson> where can I find libartsc.so ?
[01:22] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Hmmm. Any other plugins on?
[01:22] <Sebboh> MighMoS, as
[01:22] <powertool08> TX-Dan: Sorry, didn't read you whole comment about not wanting to type a command everytime until after I sent it
[01:23] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: Yeah that's my next though.
[01:23] <xcdfgkjhgcv> s/though/thought/
[01:23] <muellisoft> AdiePutera: sounds weird. *shrug* zilb seems to be missing for whatever reason. did you install packages through apt-get or have you manually installed php modules?
[01:23] <TX-Dan> mrwes, right, I've got that. However, is there any way to see new connections as they are made, rather than checking "w" on a whim to see if anyone is connected?
[01:23] <Sebboh> MighMoS, as I said, I'm trying it again so that I can record the error and tell you about it.
[01:23] <tha_infamous> but when my ubuntu trn on is sowing me something GNOME-PILOT SETINGS wat is thet for?
[01:23] <|_Mikey_|> <genii> where can you get compiling programs for Ubunty 8.10?
[01:23] <cdavis> TX-Dan: you could do watch w
[01:24] <AdiePutera> muellisoft : try apt-get  and try manually install
[01:24] <mrwes> TX-Dan, hrmm...maybe incron that monitors changes to the /var/log/auth.log
[01:24] <muellisoft> Sebboh: Maybe you must have /proc/, /dev/ and stuff mounted into your chroot.
[01:24] <Dr_Willis> the 'watch' command is real real handy
[01:24] <mrwes> hrmm...watch is kewl
[01:24] <|_Mikey_|> Dr Willis
[01:24] <TX-Dan> cdavis so watch w would continually check "w" and update?\
[01:24] <virtx> hi
[01:24] <|_Mikey_|> where do you get compiling programs
[01:24] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: Disabling all the plugins makes no difference.
[01:25] <virtx> what is the name of ffmpeg-dev package?
[01:25] <mac94161> Hey, ya'll, I can't find the linux-kernel-devel pack. Do I have the wrong name?
[01:25] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: None at all.
[01:25] <muellisoft> |_Mikey_|: what do you want to achieve?
[01:25] <Dr_Willis> |_Mikey_|:  huh?  install build-essential for the 'core' developer tools.
[01:25] <cdavis> TX-Dan: yes, watch runs the command every 2 seconds by default
[01:25] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Drat.
[01:25] <AdiePutera> anyway im using terminal
[01:25] <TX-Dan> cdavis, very cool, thanks mate
[01:25] <virtx> ffmpeg ?
[01:25] <virtx> uhm
[01:25] <cdavis> TX-Dan: No problem
[01:25] <Dr_Willis> watch 'df -h'
[01:25] <Dr_Willis> :)
[01:25] <muellisoft> mac94161: you can search for packages with apt-cache search
[01:25] <genii> |_Mikey_|: Compiling programs like the compiler itself, or source code to compile?
[01:26] <virtx> the system miss ffmpeg includes, where are?
[01:26] <|_Mikey_|> genii: compiler itself
[01:26] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Um, reboot, just for good measure?
[01:26] <cdavis> mac94161: you can search for specific files with apt-file
[01:26] <genii> |_Mikey_|: Compiler itself will be installed if you install package build-essential
[01:26] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: What good would that do?
[01:26] <|_Mikey_|> how do you install it?
[01:26] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: Are you a Windoze user?
[01:26] <muellisoft> |_Mikey_|: I install my packages through apt-get. You might want to try synaptic
[01:27] <MighMoS> I'm running Intrepid, why does do-release-upgrade tell me "No new release found"?
[01:27] <mrwes> Dr_Willis, couldn't he use incrontab to monitor the /var/log/auth.log for modifications and say then mail root@localhost ?
[01:27] <MaT-dg> is there an alternative for windows live messenger with cam support? (exept for amsn > doesn't seem to work)
[01:27] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm on one right now. I have to use it for my net browsing. My Ubuntu boxes are at home.
[01:27] <Dr_Willis> mrwes:  this is linux.. thers proberly a dozen X 3 ways to do it. :)
[01:27] <mrwes> Dr_Willis, that's it?
[01:27] <mrwes> heh
[01:27] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: I'm not going to reboot this machine.
[01:27] <muellisoft> MaT-dg: well, there is ekiga, but it's not that good :( Soon, Jabber Clients will have Cam functionality..
[01:27] <ZhuchoG> MaT-dg, pidgin/kopete?
[01:27] <Sarai> I had to reinstall Ubuntu today, but the nvidia driver isn't showing up in restricted drivers- I've installed Ubuntu twice before on this computer and never had a problem
[01:27] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: I don't blame you. :-)
[01:28] <ZhuchoG> ou
[01:28] <ZhuchoG> cam
[01:28] <thiebaude> mac94161: on on xp until i get my 9.04 cd
[01:28] <cdavis> MaT-dg: You mean like skype with a camera? That should be doable under jaunty
[01:28] <powertool08> xcdfgkjhgcv: Not even for kernel upgrades?
[01:28] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: Pidgin and Xorg are also big CPU hogs. ><
[01:28] <mac94161> thiebaude: I wish that were encouraging. :-)
[01:28] <mrwes> thiebaude, get?
[01:28] <xcdfgkjhgcv> powertool08: What I meant was that I'm not going to reboot it right now.
[01:28] <TX-Dan> New question! You guys are awesome. =)    --   If I'm logged into my SSH server remotely... as an admin, what would the syntax be to suspend another user, or reactivate another user?
[01:29] <cdavis> Sarai: I had that same problem. I had to do one round of apt-get update && apt-get upgrade before the restricted drivers showed up
[01:29] <MaT-dg> muellisoft: ZhuchoG: cdavis: a program to connect to the msn-protocol with webcam support
[01:29] <mrwes> TX-Dan, you could add their IP to the /etc/hosts.deny
[01:29] <Sarai> cdavis: okay, I'll try that. My broadcom driver showed up automatically, though
[01:29] <muellisoft> TX-Dan: what does "suspend" mean? You mean deactivating her account so that she can't login anymore?
[01:29] <xcdfgkjhgcv> mac94161: CPU cycles are important to me on this machine.
[01:29] <genii> |_Mikey_|: Missed your Q on "how to install it"til just now, did not have my name in the msg. To install from Terminal:  sudo ap-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential
[01:29] <muellisoft> MaT-dg: dunno. MSN is evil. Don't use it.
[01:29] <Dr_Willis> MSN is beyond evil :)
[01:29] <genii> |_Mikey_|: I had a typo. change "ap-" to "apt-"
[01:30] <mac94161> xcdfgkjhgcv: Yeah, but if the owner catches me installing Ubuntu on his machine... :-D
[01:30] <thiebaude> Dr_Willis: true
[01:30] <MaT-dg> muellisoft: don't get me wrong, i HATE it. I have no other choice though since al the people I know only use msn and refuse to use something better
[01:30] <TX-Dan> mrwes, the problem is that I'm logged into the SSH on an iphone app...so I can't run software, only through the app, so command line only
[01:30] <mrwes> Dr_Willis, CNN is EVIL
[01:30] <TX-Dan> muellisoft, yes, temporarily not allow them access, but i need to be able to do it from a command line

[01:31] <muellisoft> MaT-dg: if you make them use google-talk, they'll use Jabber automatically :)
[01:31] <MaT-dg> muellisoft: they simply refuse because their friends only use MSN, it's a never ending chain
[01:31] <gartral_> what console-based games are there?
[01:31] <muellisoft> TX-Dan: well, a hacky solutiuon would be to edit /etc/passwd to make the shell point to /bin/false. But I feel there are better solution. Look at useradd(1)
[01:31] <|_Mikey_|> genni:
[01:32] <|_Mikey_|> genii:
[01:32] <|_Mikey_|> how do i compile with it
[01:32] <genii> !compile | |_Mikey_|
[01:32] <ubottu> |_Mikey_|: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first)
[01:32] <|_Mikey_|> i mean with the source*
[01:32] <TX-Dan> mrwes, but that basically bans the IP not the user correct? .
[01:32] <KnoppixNoob> hm, back on Knoppix.
[01:32] <cdavis> gartral_: happypenguin.org is a good place to search for linux games
[01:32] <muellisoft> MaT-dg: well, the good thing about that is, that jabber has MSN Transports which do the MSN ugly thing for you :) So you can start using jabber and still evangelize your firends.
[01:32] <jtaji> TX-Dan: you can lock the account with 'passwd -l USER' and unlock it again with 'passwd -u USER'
[01:33] <voss> I prefer google news...why trust one source when you can read all of them!
[01:33] <gartral_> cdavis: in terminal over ssh
[01:33] <TX-Dan> jtaji, ahh nice! thanks mate!
[01:33] <genii> |_Mikey_|: The bot's link will get you started. This channel is not the place to discuss at length the intricacies of compiling, etc
[01:33] <cdavis> gartral_: lynx to search?
[01:33] <|_Mikey_|> bots link?
[01:33] <gartral_> quit
[01:33] <gartral_> quit/quit
[01:33] <genii> |_Mikey_|: EG: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware
[01:33] <cdavis> hehe
[01:33] <MaT-dg> muellisoft: I used transport before but it messes me gmail contacts and makes the webcam problem even harder ;)
[01:34] <Ademan> does anyone know why the pid stored in a pid file would consistently be two less than the actual pid of the daemon?  (the daemon is being started by start-stop-daemon)  If I had to guess I'd say the pid is from the bash instance that starts start-stop-daemon, rather than the instance of the daemon itself.  Can anyone confirm this?
[01:34] <muellisoft> MaT-dg: i can believe that :( It's a pity actually. So go and work on making IM on Linux smoother! :)
[01:34] <genii> Ademan: Interesting issue, did you search bug reports in LaunchPad yet for it?
[01:35] <Ademan> genii: nope, not yet, I suppose that'd be a good first step
[01:35] <muellisoft> hm jtaji. It doesn't seem to work with ssh publickeys. i.e. I lock an account with passwd -l but I can still SSH into it using publickey auth
[01:35] <AdiePutera> i need help with ubuntu server guide
[01:35] <AdiePutera> can someone help me with that ?
[01:35] <genii> Ademan: If it's a known issue, likely there will be explanations in detail of why it hapens, etc etc
[01:35] <muellisoft> jtaji: since the only thing it does is to scramble to password
[01:36] <genii> AdiePutera: Server support in #ubuntu-server please
[01:36] <muellisoft> AdiePutera: again: Please help us help you. Please formulate a problem you want to solve. And stop sending a couple of lines in a row, it makes you hard to follow.
[01:36] <AdiePutera> ty geirha
[01:36] <AdiePutera> genii
[01:36] <thiebaude> anyone, when i install my 9.04 should i go for ext4 instead of ext3?
[01:36] <genii> AdiePutera: np
[01:36] <cast> muellisoft: makes sense public key would still work fine, notice what --lock does
[01:36] <powertool08> thiebaude: Why not? I hear its faster. newer is usually better right? ;)
[01:36] <muellisoft> cast: what do you mean with --lock?
[01:37] <thiebaude> powertool08: yea, i heard its fast
[01:37] <MaT-dg> thiebaude: yes, it boots way faster
[01:37] <thiebaude> xp, doesn't have much longer on this pc
[01:37] <cast> muellisoft: what is passwd -l?
[01:37] <powertool08> thiebaude: I also heard it was basically reiserfs renamed, except it doesn't kill your wife.
[01:37] <thiebaude> haha
[01:37] <muellisoft> cast: it is supposed to lock an unix account so that you can't log in anymore.
[01:38] <muellisoft> -l     This  option  is  used  to  lock the specified account and it is              available to root only. The locking is  performed  by  rendering              the  encrypted password into an invalid string (by prefixing the              encrypted string with an !).
[01:38] <syntax\> how can i close ports 445 and 139?
[01:38] <cast> muellisoft: --lock is the long option of -l.
[01:38] <muellisoft> cast: not on my fedora machine.
[01:38] <thiebaude> powertool08: i used 9.04 before, but it was an upgrade from 8.10, this time i'll go for the fresh install
[01:39] <powertool08> syntax\: Get a firewall or disable netbios? whatever it is that runs on those ports.
[01:39] <muellisoft> might be an ubuntu-patch-not-given-upstream though
[01:39] <aoeui> on ubuntu --lock = -l
[01:39] <powertool08> thiebaude: I always upgrade with a fresh install and keep /home on its own partition to save my settings
[01:39] <syntax\> powertool08: ok thanks.
[01:39] <cast> muellisoft: good thing i dont care about your fedora machine :)
[01:40] <|_Mikey_|> alright thanks genii, I'll talk to you later
[01:40] <thiebaude> powertool08: how much memory do you keep for Home?
[01:40] <thiebaude> allocate
[01:40] <powertool08> thiebaude: Do you mean how big is my swap?
[01:40] <boshhead> I'm having trouble with my volume. I believe I've set everything at max level, but the volume is still much too low :(
[01:41] <powertool08> thiebaude: Or how much hardrive space for home?
[01:41] <thiebaude> powertool08: actually how big will your Home dir be
[01:41] <powertool08> thiebaude: My /home is 50 gb
[01:41] <thiebaude> kewl, i have 160gb drive
[01:41] <powertool08> thiebaude: currently 77% used
[01:42] <thiebaude> wow
[01:42] <thiebaude> powertool08: i have never used more than 4gb
[01:42] <powertool08> thiebaude: I have 200 gb across two drives, /home is full right now because I download my torrents there, then move them to my external when I sort them
[01:43] <thiebaude> powertool08: oh

[01:52] <lozada-sama_> dont understand mitch
[01:52] <lozada-sama_> ooohhh
[01:53] <DeltaS4> much*
[01:53] <mac94161> I understand "linux-kernel-devel" is a "dummy package". How do I install such an unfortunate package? :-)
[01:53] <arooni-mobile> seems like jaunty and intel graphics cards dont take well together...........  shold i just wait for next release?  (http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_9.04_(Jaunty_Jackalope)_on_a_ThinkPad_T61)
[01:54] <mattgirv> mac94161: In the same way you install anything else, apt-get install .. it will just link to the latest kernel-devel
[01:54] <DeltaS4> anyway how do i put mp3 to work on amarok2? also jaunty gnome
[01:54] <mattgirv> mac94161: if your kernel isnt the latest one, dont use that.. find your version
[01:54] <lozada-sama_> wait wait iam sorry
[01:54] <xangua> arooni-mobile: the intel issue has been fixed, but you have to activate the jaunty proposed and backport updates
[01:55] <lozada-sama_> my desktop is gnomw
[01:55] <lozada-sama_> *gnome
[01:55] <arooni-mobile> xangua, why?
[01:55] <xangua> lozada-sama_ then you need to install xine
[01:55] <mac94161> mattgirv, thanks. I'm compiling a custom kernel and I apparently need the pack. I am using an offline debian fetcher to get the package, so apt-get install is not an option. :-(
[01:55] <xangua> arooni-mobile: because the fix is in jaunty proposed and backport updates ................................................
[01:55] <mattgirv> ah ok :)
[01:55] <lozada-sama_> xine ? what does it do ?
[01:56] <xcdfgkjhgcv> xangua: What's the fix called?
[01:56] <arooni-mobile> xangua, will it make it into the main line updates?
[01:56] <DeltaS4> lozada sama did you understand
[01:56] <mattgirv> if you haven't updated it, that package will be on your install cd too
[01:56] <xangua> xcdfgkjhgcv arooni-mobile is just an update of xorg intel
[01:56] <thiebaude> !xine
[01:56] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xine
[01:56] <lozada-sama_> i guess deltass4
[01:56] <xunil> xine is a lightweight media player
[01:56] <xcdfgkjhgcv> arooni-mobile: I found that enabling the greedy option in xorg.conf helped for me.
[01:56] <DeltaS4> shine
[01:56] <mac94161> mattgirv, could you check to see what "linux-kernel-devel" links to? I'm on a Windoze machine...
[01:56] <xunil> it can be operated via command line
[01:56] <mattgirv> mac94161: uname -r and check your kernel version
[01:56] <xunil> or with a GUI
[01:56] <DeltaS4> windows is the best isnt it?
[01:56] <xcdfgkjhgcv> xangua: Thanks. I'll take a look.
[01:56] <mattgirv> mac94161: one sec
[01:57] <bcurtiswx> anyone here use UNR?
[01:57] <mac94161> mattgirv: Oh, I'm on 8.10.
[01:57] <mac94161> mattgirv, don't know if that matters.
[01:57] <lozada-sama_> oh ... but a friend recommended me amarok cause it organizes music very well even better then itunes
[01:57] <lozada-sama_> isnt there a way you could go around ??
[01:57] <powertool08> lozada-sama_: its a resource hog in my opinion
[01:58] <thiebaude> powertool08: yea it does
[01:58] <lozada-sama_> oh
[01:58] <mattgirv> mac94161: Yeah it'll make a difference. 9.04 we're at now, You are best off running uname -r .. finding out which version you are running from that and download the linux-headers-VERSION
[01:58] <DeltaS4> itunes if installed with quicktime is like 100mb isnt it?
[01:58] <DeltaS4> it sucks on windows
[01:58] <powertool08> lozada-sama_: I prefer mpd+ncmpc, except when my ncmpc is broken, like it is now :(
[01:59] <xangua> xcdfgkjhgcv arooni-mobile i should say i really don't know is a fix but since 2 days ago i havent have any issues
[01:59] <mac94161> mattgirv, Oh, OK, got it. Thanks so much!
[01:59] <xcdfgkjhgcv> xangua: Hmmm are you sure this update is going to improve performance?
[01:59] <mattgirv> mac94161: Also get linux-source-VERSION :) of course
[01:59] <lozada-sama_> tought
[01:59] <xcdfgkjhgcv> xangua: It's still 2.6.
[01:59] <thiebaude> DeltaS4: yea, something like that
[01:59] <mac94161> mattgirv, OK, will do.
[01:59] <arooni-mobile> xangua, you have a t61?
[01:59] <xangua> xcdfgkjhgcv: yes, i haven had any problems, for example my screen use to freeze 2 or 3 times a day but now that hasn't happend
[02:00] <xangua> arooni-mobile:  i hace an intel video cadr integrated in an acer aspire
[02:00] <xangua> is it X3100
[02:00] <xcdfgkjhgcv> xangua: Stability is fine for me, it's performance that I need.
[02:00] <xcdfgkjhgcv> xangua: I have an Intel GMA950
[02:00] <xangua> xcdfgkjhgcv: performance is also good, way too far from the 2.4 version of xorg (intrepid ibex)
[02:01] <arooni-mobile> iwant stability
[02:01] <arooni-mobile> is jaunty awesome
[02:01] <arooni-mobile> how is it better than ibex
[02:01] <arooni-mobile> especially for those with laptops
[02:01] <xangua> and sorry for my bad english if i missed something, normaly i don't write a lot in a very short time
[02:02] <thiebaude> arooni-mobile: for me 9.04 is faster and uses less resources
[02:02] <xcdfgkjhgcv> xangua: Call me sceptical, but I doubt that upgrading xserver-xorg-video-intel from version 2:2.6.3-0ubuntu9 to version 2:2.6.3-0ubuntu9.1 is going to improve things much.
[02:02] <arooni-mobile> thats good
[02:02] <xunil> i tried 9.04 on my laptop and it actually ran a lot slower
[02:02] <arooni-mobile> oh noes
[02:02] <ticked> anyone notice if 9.04 has support for atheros, or do ya still need madwifi?
[02:02] <xunil> so i went back to 8.04 (8.10 never could install properly)
[02:02] <xangua> xcdfgkjhgcv: you can try and if it dosn't do anything to you you can always downgrade
[02:02] <xunil> still need madwifi
[02:03] <ticked> argh
[02:03] <xunil> ya
[02:03] <ticked> never could get it to work
[02:03] <xangua> but for me it works
[02:03] <ticked> cool
[02:03] <xunil> i cant wait till madwifi updates for the newer mimo cards :D
[02:03] <josh_1xy> hey every1, does anyone know about the option to install linux "side-by-side" onto a Windows partition?
[02:03] <mac94161> mattgirv, I can't fin any kernel-devels. What's that name of the package that your 9.04 machine links it to?
[02:03] <lozada-sama_> well ? doesnt anyone know how to put amarok 2 playing mp3 and aac?
[02:04] <xunil> i think its called a frugal install..... but i am not 100% on that
[02:04] <Guest21486> Flannel: Can you tell me again the website for resetting password on startup
[02:04] <xangua> lozada-sama_ install xine ...........

[02:06] <Buttons840> When I compile a program from source, it typically places files all over my directories (from my POV).  What is the easiest way to remove one of these programs once it's files spread across multiple directories?
[02:06] <KnoppixNoob> should work...
[02:06] <powertool08> xangua: Ok, didn't know that, I don't use it.
[02:06] <xunil> ah.. i know rhythmbox uses the gstreamer. It is waht i use when im not listening to pandora radio
[02:07] <lozada-sama_> i already search in google and in forums
[02:07] <xangua> powertool08: he could configure amarok to use gstreamer but he will need to install ALL kde desktop just to do that

[02:24] <hacim> i've got my jaunty laptop hooked up to an external LCD, the laptop LCD display is not the right size and I can't seem to get it to adjust to the right one
[02:24] <syva> xagua1, no, it does not load into fullscreen mode, it is just that the gnome titlebar is missing
[02:25] <Chrisnewb> ok here is my issue, I have a ati radeon 3650 running with jaunty.. when i try to get flxgrs running and to where i can play mkv files it stutters and is very slow framerate
[02:25] <syva> mac94161, the other thing i notice is that the firefox doesnt take account of other applications i have set to "always on top"; firefox always sets itself ontop
[02:25] <xangua1> syva: maybe Firefox Gnome Support missing <unconvertable>
[02:25] <Chrisnewb> also for some reason when i try to do dual setup the xserver wont run and it corrupts the whole xorg
[02:26] <mac94161> syva: Temporary fix: hit F11. Fold on for permanent fix...
[02:26] <Chrisnewb> right now i dont have flxgrs running
[02:26] <mac94161> syva: *hit F11 TWICE.
[02:26] <xunil> Chrisnewb: how are you configureing it? are you using ati-config?
[02:26] <fore> can someone help me, please, i am using synergy's client in ubuntu 9.04 and i need it to start when the login page does so that i can just use one mouse and keyboard
[02:26] <Chrisnewb> can someone help me get it running correctly to where it doesnt stutter on videos
[02:26] <syva> mac94161, yes going fullscreen then leavng fullscreen fixes it, but i want a proper fix
[02:27] <Chrisnewb> i dont know how to use aticonfig, and i tried installing envy
[02:27] <mac94161> OK, hang on...
[02:27] <etzerd> how can I install the codecs to play DVD?

[02:29] <draco1889> does anyone have any suggestions? my home and root partitions are being corrupted afer using ubuntu 9.04, i've already reinstalled a few times.
[02:29] <xunil> Chrisnewb; i belive the command is sudo aticonfig --initial=dual --layout=right
[02:29] <mac94161> syva: run this command in your home directory and give me the output: "find . -name extensions.rdf "
[02:30] <rabid> draco1889: maybe try fsck from live cd on those partitions?
[02:30] <syva> mac94161, ok running
[02:30] <etzerd> xangual: what is the command to install ubuntu extras?
[02:30] <Chrisnewb> so remove envy and reinstall the drivers from the ati site?
[02:30] <draco1889> rabid, that does work but the partitions will only be corrupted again
