[22:54] <sysysy> hi
[22:54] <sysysy> i can ping 192.168.1.1 but i cant browse it
[22:55] <ReimuHakurei> does the device at that address have a webserver active?
[22:55] <ReimuHakurei> Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
[22:55] <sysysy> no
[22:55] <k1l> sysysy: does it offer something to browse?
[22:57] <sysysy> k1l, i get timeout in browser
[22:57] <k1l> sysysy: is there a webserver on that ip/machine?
[22:57] <sysysy> no
[22:58] <k1l> so what do you want to browse in the browser then?
[22:58] <sysysy> its just a simple tplink
[22:59] <k1l> sysysy: if it doesnt offer a webservice there is nothing you can browse
[22:59] <ReimuHakurei> so if there is no webserver running, why would you expect a web browser to do anything?
[22:59] <sysysy> i want to do configuration in my modem
[22:59] <k1l> sysysy: then read the manual of that machine how to do that
[23:00] <sysysy> k1l, it said that the ip is 192.168.1.1
[23:01] <sysysy> my ip is 192.168.1.12
[23:01] <sysysy> there are in same range
[23:01] <sysysy> but i can ping 192.168.1.1
[23:01] <sysysy> and cant browse 192.168.1.1
[23:02] <causative> this is a router, sysysy ? perhaps reboot it, or do a factory reset, maybe it is broken
[23:02] <causative> are you sure it's your router and not just another computer on your network though
[23:02] <nacc> sysysy: does your modem run a webservice?
[23:03] <nacc> sysysy: you said above it does not. so i'm not sure why you're asking #ubuntu for help?
[23:03] <sysysy> if i do factory reset i will lost my configuration
[23:03] <rymax99> Modem or router, there's a difference
[23:04] <rymax99> Most store-bought modems have no real configuration options
[23:04] <nacc> this is a larger issue than that, afaict
[23:04] <causative> unless they are modem-routers
[23:04] <nacc> sysysy has said there is no web-service running
[23:04] <sysysy> rymate1234, i had connection to it before
[23:04] <nacc> it is nonsense to then complain you can't browse the device's IP in your browser
[23:04] <rymax99> I've yet to see any store-bought or ISP provided modem made in the last 10 years without a web service running
[23:05] <nacc> rymax99: we can only go off what people say
[23:05] <rymax99> right :P
[23:05] <sysysy> i connected to modem before and i did configuration
[23:05] <nacc> rymax99: and in any case, it's not Ubuntu's issue if the device is broken in some way, either
[23:05] <Fleuv> Hello since a few days ago my wired internet connection is very unstable. I noticed a few things in my log files, have a look: http://pastebin.com/6kU1pmPA What does this mean and could this be the cause?
[23:05] <Zythyr> Need help. I am running Ubuntu 16. I installed the Nvidia drivers becasue my desktop has Nvidia Ion graphics card. After installing these driver, I no longer have fb0 device listed under /dev/
[23:06] <rymax99> sysysy, look up it's manual online on how to access it
[23:07] <pavlos> sysysy, http://192.168.1.1/ should prompt for username/password
[23:07] <rymax99> it's more than likely to be configured via a web service and if you're unable to access it then try another device or do a hard reset, further from that, it's not an issue meant for this channel
[23:07] <sysysy> The connection has timed out
[23:07] <k1l> sysysy: ask the tp-link support what the issue is.
[23:08] <sysysy> i got username and password for this before but i get connection has time out now
[23:09] <rymax99> sysysy: <rymax99> it's more than likely to be configured via a web service and if you're unable to access it then try another device or do a hard reset, further from that, it's not an issue meant for this channel
[23:09] <pavlos> sysysy, remove the power from the router, count 5, re-plug. Maybe your router needs a reboot
[23:09] <sysysy> pavlos, do i lost configuration in this way ?

This command displays the image in full screne mode to /dev/fb0 or a device I select. When using generic drivers (Nouveau), I already have a /dev/fb0 device and fbi command works fine. HOwever, when I installed Nvidia drivers (v340), the /dev/fb0 device is no longer present. Thus
[00:01] <Zythyr> when I use the fbi command to display an image to framebuffer, I get error that /dev/fb0 device not found.

[02:48] <rangergord> OerHeks: regarding the 1st link, none of the guides are about how to add parameters to the command. I'll check out the 2nd link now.
[02:49] <OerHeks> create your own launcher, in your /home/ or systemwide..
[02:50] <dimisdas> Spark: Active Port: analog-output-headphones
[02:50] <dimisdas> Spark: are you listening through headphones jack?
[02:51] <Spark> hmm i'm not sure
[02:51] <Spark> i'll try some other jacks though
[02:52] <bandit22> why and where is ubuntu retrieving files from when installing?
[02:52] <bandit22> what happens if you tell it to skip
[02:52] <Spark> dimisdas: can you change hte port with pactl too?
[02:53] <Spark> ah it's pacmd
[02:53] <rangergord> OerHeks: I created a myapp.desktop file that runs "/usr/bin/code --disable-gpu", put it in ~/.local/share/application/myapp.desktop (where I see other .desktop files), logged out, logged back in, it doesn't appear.
[02:54] <rangergord> OerHeks: I didn't have an icon to use though, so I deleted the Icon entry. I'll try again with an icon copied from a different launcher.

[02:54] <ubottu> bandit22: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories - See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecommendedSources for the recommended way to set up your repositories.
[02:55] <dimisdas> Spark: your configuration is for alsa not pulse audio right?
[02:56] <Spark> i dunno it's the default
[02:56] <bandit22> why is every thing not on DVD?
[02:56] <Spark> i don't use gnome, if that's relevant
[02:56] <Spark> i tried pacmd set-sink port for both available ports, but i didn't get sound on either.  I did get a click in the headphones as i switched though, so something's plumbed in
[02:57] <rangergord> OerHeks: none of those instructions worked.
[02:57] <dimisdas> Spark: the configuration you linked is for Alsa. You can control it with alsa-mixer. Pulseaudio is different software
[02:57] <dimisdas> Spark: which ubuntu/Linux flavour are you using?

[02:58] <Spark> yakkety
[02:59] <rangergord> Isn't this a pretty typical task for a user? I mean Windows had this in Win95, didn't they? And past Unity releases had it, since the (out of date) wiki says to right-click a launcher entry to edit it.
[02:59] <Spark> dimisdas: i put it in one of the ports at the back and it worked...
[02:59] <dimisdas> Spark: yay
[03:00] <Spark> line out port it was
[03:00] <Countess_Bathory> rangergord, maybe you can do one to suit your needs,  example for making a chromium link:  echo 'chromium-browser --incognito' > /home/user/chromium.sh ; chmod +x /home/user/chromium.sh   hope that helps =)
[03:01] <rangergord> I thought of launching a custom script, but when I came here I was hoping for the "correct way" which would end up with the correct application icon. But it doesn't seem like Unity supports this directly, so I'll go the custom script way. Thanks.
[03:02] <rangergord> Should I be reporting these 2 issuse on the Unity bug tracker? 1) No way for user to customize locked entry, 2) .desktop files don't work, or their doc is incorrect, or it's too hard to mess up?
[03:02] <Countess_Bathory> give it a custom icon ,  open it , right click lock to launcher ?
[03:04] <Spark> dimisdas: i just adjusted the volume and it's gone dead again :(
[03:04] <Spark> on both ports
[03:04] <dimisdas> Use alsa-mixer
[03:04] <dimisdas> To change port
[03:05] <Spark> you mean alsamixer?
[03:05] <rangergord> Countess_Bathory: I can't do that, it locks the code executable, without the script's parameters. And I can't click and drag the sh file to the Launcher.
[03:05] <dimisdas> Yup
[03:06] <rangergord> Countess_Bathory: I can't "Make Link" then drag the link to the Launcher either
[03:06] <Spark> it doesn't seem to be available anymore
[03:06] <Spark> there is alsamixergui, but that only knows about pulseaudio
[03:06] <tgm4883> rangergord: have you tried adding it (the script you make) to the desktop file?
[03:07] <rangergord> tgm4883: no, I'll try now.
[03:07] <Spark> dcunnin@expensive:~$ alsamixer
[03:07] <Spark> cannot open mixer: No such file or directory
[03:07] <Spark> there i have it, but it doesn't work :)
[03:08] <Spark> i do have files in /dev/snd/ though
[03:08] <rangergord> tgm4883: doesn't work.
[03:09] <tgm4883> rangergord: what part doesn't work?
[03:09] <rangergord> tgm4883: the .desktop file doesn't appear in the launcher
[03:09] <Spark> alsamixer -c 1 worked
[03:09] <rangergord> http://pastebin.com/raw/yFwVHXsN
[03:10] <tgm4883> rangergord: can you paste the code in your.... you're ahead of me :)
[03:10] <Spark> yeah it works now... heh
[03:10] <Spark> pulseaudio was failing at controlling the alsa mixer i guess
[03:11] <tgm4883> rangergord: did you really name your user, user1?
[03:11] <rangergord> tgm4883: yeah, it's just a VM so I don't make it personal :P
[03:11] <dimisdas> Spark: if it happens again try deleting asound.conf (backup first) and restarting
[03:11] <Spark> thanks for your help
[03:12] <tgm4883> rangergord: did you run desktop-file-validate against it? Because I did and it threw some errors
[03:12] <rangergord> tgm4883: no I did not. trying now.
[03:12] <rangergord> aaah wait
[03:13] <rangergord> I see the issue. The .desktop file doesn't add it to the launcher, it adds it to the searchable menu. So if I search for "vscode", it shows up.
[03:14] <rangergord> but I can't lock that resulting script to the launcher
[03:14] <tgm4883> rangergord: ah yea
[03:14] <rangergord> it locks the actual application only
[03:14] <rangergord> which then runs without the necessary parameter (--disable-gpu)
[03:14] <tgm4883> rangergord: well at this point I'd look and see what the actual vscode desktop file looks like, copy that into your directory and then alter it a bit
[03:14] <rangergord> so the thing to do now, is figuring out what files "lock to launcher" modifies, to be able to do that for my script, not just the application itself
[03:15] <tgm4883> rangergord: or fall back to instead of calling the script to call the actual executable again with the argument
[03:15] <tgm4883> rangergord: unfortunatly I don't run Unity anymore, so I can't help much further
[03:17] <rangergord> tgm4883: I stopped a few years ago, but came back recently, figured it would have become more usable. Instead they removed even more customization options :/
[03:17] <rangergord> this is literally the first Unity flavor I run in 4 years. I went to Mint, then Xubuntu, then Ubuntu MATE, then KDE Neon
[03:17] <tgm4883> rangergord: most work is happening in Unity 8, Unity 7 is in maintenance mode
[03:18] <rangergord> tgm4883: hopefully 2018.04 is the year of a desktop Ubuntu power users like
[03:18] <Countess_Bathory> if link is put on the desktop it retains parameters , unlike the launcher
[03:19] <roliz> help i am having issues with with ubuntu studio
[03:20] <roliz> it is not connnecting to wifi
[03:21] <roliz> i  have tried going to additional drivers but it is not using them
[03:21] <rangergord> Countess_Bathory: that's the final solution then, it works. Editing the actual code.desktop file in /usr/share/applications, then locking that to the launcher. Personally I don't see how it's any different from my custom .desktop file, but oh well.
[03:22] <roliz> ok i will try thanks :{
[03:22] <rangergord> are either of you running Unity 8? does it let you customize launcher entries, without having to resort to editing files in /usr/share/applications?
[03:24] <Countess_Bathory> nope, have not used/tried Unity 8

[03:46] <Zythyr> Can someone please help me. I am running Ubuntu 16 LTS. I installed Nvidia drivers using "sudo apt-get install nvidia-current". It installed v304. The issue now is that I don't have a /dev/fb0 device. How can I determine what is my framebuffer device?
=== Piece_Maker is now known as Acou_Bass
[03:49] <BWestOz> Is it possible to make a copy of a web site using wget --mirror. I tried it and it sort of worked but some of the links don't work.
[03:49] <Bashing-om> Zythyr: nvidia-current is the 304 version driver that might not be correct for your card . What card ' lspci -vnn | grep -i VGA ' and we see if we can match a driver .
[03:53] <Zythyr> Bashing-om It says I have NVIDIA Corporation ION VGA
[03:54] <Bashing-om> Zythyr: Pastebin that entire output . so I get the "number" .
[03:58] <rangergord> is it possible to make running apps in the left-side launcher stand out more than unopened ones? that little arrow and a tiny change in brightness is not enough of a visual indication. I'd like a more obvious contrast, like much darker icons for unopened apps. I looked at Unity Tweak Tool, there's no setting for this.
[03:58] <Zythyr> Bashing-om pastebin.com/R6x81Mnu
[04:00] <vers> yo
[04:02] <Bashing-om> Zythyr: Well, that does not tell me what I need to know . Let's try - lspci -k|grep -iEA5 'vga|3d' - see if that gives me the number .
[04:05] <Zythyr> Bashing-om http://pastebin.com/vSRQQaxZ
[04:06] <Zythyr> Bashing-om This is the system where I installed Ubuntu 16 LTS on: http://www.viewsonic.com/us/vot132-vot132-1-19f01591b6ca3ba03f1aedc8db12cdb9.html
[04:11] <Bashing-om> Zythyr: Still scratching my head .. gimme a bit .
[04:11] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: is your system up to dat to 16.04.2?
[04:12] <Zythyr> lotuspsychje Yes, it is 16.06.2
[04:12] <Zythyr> Bashing-om What exactly are we looking for?
[04:14] <Zythyr> The reason I installed Nvidia drivers is because if I use the generic open source drivers, I am unable to boot into the OS. I get stuck at a black screen. This occurs when I use a projector (monitor) with a low resolution that supports two modes: 912x1140 or 1280x800. If I use a regular monitor, it boots fine.
[04:14] <Bashing-om> Zythyr: lotuspsychje As a newer hardware - sure that the 340 driver is not correct . Might just purge the present driver and have the system "autoinstall" and see what the sytem installs for a graphic's driver ??
[04:14] <Zythyr> However, it is crucial for me to have the framebuffer device /dev/fb0. After installing Nvidia drivers, I can properly boots, but I can't find the /dev/fb0 device
[04:15] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: wich driver versions show up at your additional drivers?
[04:16] <Bashing-om> Zythyr: My "number" >> NVIDIA Corporation GK208 [GeForce GT 710B] .. that GT 710 is a number of reference .
[04:17] <Zythyr> Additional drivers give me three options: 304, 340, and open source
[04:17] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: did you test them all?
=== rrones is now known as strones
[04:19] <Zythyr> lotuspsychje By default opensource drivers were installed in which I have /dev/fb0, however I have booting issues with my low resolution projector. I tested both 304 and 340 which fixed booting inssues but there is no /dev/fb0. I do see /dev/nvidia0
[04:19] <Zythyr> According to this and the device id the Nvidia ion could be GeForce 9400?? https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23214

[04:20] <strones> aarontc, https://youtu.be/Sz2mgIhGtgs
[04:22] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: its possible you might need a latest driver from the ubuntu driver ppa
[04:23] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: also secureboot can be a problem with nvidia cards, you know ifits enabled or not?
[04:23] <Zythyr> What is ifits
[04:24] <Zythyr> lotuspsychje How do I install the latest driver from ubuntu ppa?
[04:24] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: if it is enabled
[04:25] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: http://askubuntu.com/questions/760934/graphics-issues-after-while-installing-ubuntu-16-04-16-10-with-nvidia-graphics
[04:26] <Zythyr> lotuspsychje Should I do sudo apt-get install nvidia-340??.
[04:27] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: no, you already tested the 340 you say and doesnt fix right?
[04:29] <Zythyr> So then what do I test next? Do I install using "sudo apt-get install nvidia-current"?
[04:30] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: no current isnt active anymore, try that askubuntu step, where they add the ubuntu graphics ppa
[04:30] <Zythyr> I added the pppa
[04:31] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: check additional drivers wich ones show up now
[04:32] <Zythyr> Ohh okay. Let me check that. Also, I think to check this in the Ubuntu Software GUI app?
[04:33] <lotuspsychje> Zythyr: no, drivers are managed by installing the terminal way, or via additional drivers
[04:35] <Zythyr> What command do I n eed to use to see additional drivers
[04:35] <Zythyr> Sorry I am a noob

[04:50] <Zythyr> I added the ppa, but I still don't see more
[04:50] <Zythyr> Using this guide, I checked to see if i installed using UEFI method. However my installation is in Legacy mode https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[04:51] <Bashing-om> Zythyr: I find it hard to accept that a system that supports Win7 has such an old generation video card as I apparently find . This may well be beyond my pay grade .
[04:52] <Zythyr> I still am confused. The 340 drivers are installed perfectly fine. The only issue is I don't know how to get the /dev/fb0 device.
[04:54] <Zythyr> The reason why I need the /dev/fb0 device is because I am using a program called fbi (framebuffer image viewer) to display PNG images in full screen mode. This program askes me to select my framebuffer device (by default /dev/fb0). But I don't have /dev/fb0 so it gives me error. I don't know what other device to select
[04:55] <Ben64> Zythyr: why are you trying to use the framebuffer and nvidia?
[04:58] <Zythyr> I have a projector (mointor) which will connected to the Ubuntu. I want to display images in fullscreen mode for 3d printing application. So I am using the fbi (framebuffer image viewer) sofwtare. The reason I hadd to intall nvidia drivers is because if I use the generic drivers (nouveau), I can't boot into the desktop. I get stuck at blackscreen. The reason for this is because the project
[04:58] <Zythyr> supports only two low resolution display: 912x1140 and 1280x800. WHen I connect a regular high resolution mointor it boots perfectly fine. Thus I need to install nvidia driver to get Ubuntu to boot properly when connected to the projector
[04:58] <Ben64> desktop or framebuffer, pick one
[04:58] <Zythyr> Ben64 What do u mean
[04:58] <Ben64> exactly what i said
[04:59] <Bashing-om> Zythyr: Looking at my log file . the target appears to be " (II) FBDEV: driver for framebuffer: fbdev " .
[04:59] <Zythyr> Ben64 Are you suggesting I should boot directly to console instead of desktop gui?
[04:59] <Ben64> if you need framebuffer yes
[05:00] <Ben64> but i don't see why you actually need framebuffer
[05:00] <Zythyr> Bashing-om Log file of waht are you looking at?
[05:01] <Zythyr> Ben64 I need framebuffer becasue the fbi program dispaly my desired PNG to framebuffer: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/fbi.1.html
[05:01] <Ben64> so use a different program
[05:01] <Zythyr> Don't have any other option than using fbi
[05:01] <Bashing-om> Zythyr: /var/log/Xorg.0.log .
[05:01] <Ben64> Zythyr: you have a desktop, you have tons of choices
[05:02] <Ben64> why use one of the only programs that doesn't work for what you want?
[05:02] <Zythyr> Bashing-om I don't have /dev/fbdev.
[05:02] <Zythyr> Ben64 Other alternate programs also utilize framebuffer
[05:03] <Ben64> framebuffer isn't what you want
[05:03] <Ben64> i don't know why you think it is
[05:03] <Bashing-om> Zythyr: Affirmed .. me neither .,.. why I went looking for a different target . /dev/fb0 does not exist .
[05:05] <Zythyr> Bashing-om Even my log says "(EE) open /dev/fb0: No such file or directory"
[05:06] <Zythyr> Ben64 Then how to acheive what I am trying to do? My end goal is 3d printing. Framebuffer is fastest way to load/display image?
[05:06] <Ben64> no
[05:07] <Ben64> i don't see how displaying an image = 3d printing but theres all sorts of programs that display images
[05:07] <Ben64> eog, display, pqiv, etc

[05:51] <Bashing-om> Necy: Re-biit and as soon as the firmware screen clears spam the escape key -> language screen, escape jeu to accept the default -> boot options screen -> F6 key  -> boot parameters options ( space-bar to select, tab to OK, enter to accept ) .
[05:51] <Bashing-om> reboot*
[06:02] <Aurorasaura> is there a way to see a progress bar when using cp -rp?
=== ifro_ is now known as bedfro
[06:05] <Necy> <Bashing-om> i can only get as far as the GRUB screen (with "Start kubuntu", "OME install.." ect.) and there is no f6 option
=== pavlushka is now known as whizzkid
=== whizzkid is now known as pavlushka
[06:07] <Bashing-om> Necy: That is not the screen ya want . trt again from a reboot . there is but a 3 second window of opportunity to redirect to boot the boot options screen .
[06:08] <Necy> <Bashing-om> is it the bios we want?
[06:10] <Bashing-om> Necy: No, this is past bios ( EFI ) / as soon as the bios screen clears spam the escape key .

[06:23] <Necy> <Bashing-om> im at a screen, but it was via f2. "boot mode is set to: UEFI" ECT. is the the correct one?
[06:23] <pagios> how can i bypass this
[06:24] <Necy> its blue
[06:24] <pagios> i am not root
[06:24] <Necy> UEFI options screen
=== bwr_ is now known as bwr
[06:27] <Bashing-om> Necy: No. ya want to get past the UEFI booting . As to how I can not advise - every manufacturer does it different . You want to boot the installer in EFI mode . and get to the boot parameters screen by spamming the escape key .
[06:29] <Necy> <Bashing-om> to even to run the cd i have to f12 and select CDROM1. do i do that and then spam esc?
[06:30] <Necy> because that takes me to a grub menu :s
[06:30] <Necy> "grub>"
[06:33] <jpugarte1> sup guys, anyone here who can help me a little bit with resizing my partitions?
[06:34] <Necy> maybe if i disable secureboot or change to legacy?
[06:34] <Necy> idk
[06:36] <Bashing-om> Necy: Each manufacturer does it different as there is no specification set . I Do not know what to tell you in your particular case . But the CD does not boot until after the firmware ( bios ) . As soon as that bios screen clears then spam the escape key to redirect the boot process to the boot parameters screen .
[06:38] <Bashing-om> Necy: If you are dual booting You want to install in the same mode as that of Windows ( EFI !) .
[06:40] <Necy> i have two options in the bottom corner when i boot, a boot options with f12 and boot settings f2
[06:40] <Necy> <Bashing-om>*
[06:44] <Bashing-om> Necy: I know you are getting frustrated .. but I say again .. I can not know .
[06:44] <cfhowlett> Necy, one of those is for a temporary boot setting, the other is for making "permanent" settings.  either will work.
[06:45] <Necy> <Bashing-om> im just confused
[06:46] <Bashing-om> Necy: EFI is confusing to a lot of us . there is no standard .

[07:24] <Delphin> hi, I recently uninstalled amavis but keep getting errors like "postfix/qmgr[26708]: warning: connect to transport private/smtp-amavis: Connection refused" in my /var/log/mail.log, can anyone help?
[07:34] <zerl> gday, hoping someone can shed some light on my problem. trying to run apt-get on 12.04 getting "version `GLIBC_2.18' not found" error from apt-get
[07:35] <zerl> tried downloading fresh apt from packages and installing with dpkg with no change in the above error, mind you it would not configure due to the deps issue
[07:36] <zerl> what can I do in this situation to get the package management system working again
[07:36] <stevendale> Hi zerl
[07:37] <zerl> dpkgis reporting apt depends on libstdc++6 (>= 4.6); however: Package libstdc++6 is not configured yet,
[07:37] <stevendale> I'm afraid you have to upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu. http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/libc6 12.04 only supports 'glibc' up to 2.15, not 2.18
[07:37] <ducasse> zerl: try 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
[07:38] <zerl> I am wondering if i have been pw0wned becasue I have no idea how it ended up in this state
[07:39] <zerl> tried that , will DM you output
[07:40] <zerl> somehow libstc++6 is not configured
[07:40] <ducasse> zerl: please use a pastebin next time

[07:40] <zerl> oh ... very sorry
[07:41] <ducasse> zerl: try 'sudo apt-get install -f'
[07:41] <ducasse> zerl: what does it want to do?
[07:42] <zerl> This is the output from sudo dpkg --configure -a ---- http://paste.ubuntu.com/24100794/
[07:43] <zerl> This is the output from that last one http://paste.ubuntu.com/24100799/
[07:43] <zerl> that was one of the first commands I tried actuallty
[07:45] <zerl> I was playing with tomcat, guacamole last time I was on this server so no idea why libstdc++ is broken
[07:46] <ducasse> zerl: ok, not sure what has happened here, probably a third-party repo. do you have anything in /etc/sources.list.d?
[07:46] <zerl> lemme check
[07:47] <zerl> guacamole-stable-precise.list  guacamole-stable-precise.list.save  webupd8team-y-ppa-manager-precise.list

[07:55] <zerl> can I lookup the policy on the libs directly in a text file?
[07:56] <theosvoitha> hello. I installed Ubuntu 16.10 (64) by minimal Install method and selected "basic system utilities". but when I boot and select "ubuntu" I just get blinking prompt. two times I tried but I get same thing. will appreciate any help.
[07:58] <theosvoitha> I installed on a HP uefi machine. using a live CD I found that partitions and data is there but am just unable to get to the login screen.
[07:58] <ducasse> zerl: yes, you can loop through them and look them up, but shouldn't we focus on this?
[07:58] <zerl> yes
=== john is now known as Guest48324
[07:59] <zerl> I just meant is there a manual way to look up the apt policy on libstc++6 since apt is broken
[08:00] <anddam> theosvoitha: so it's not starting at all, is it? that is there's no boot phase from ramdisk
[08:01] <zerl> theosvoitha: did you note the comments on the minimal ISO page regarding UEFI? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[08:01] <Necy> if i install ubuntu on guided for resizing the windows partition, will this be ntfs automatically? or can i set it as ext4?
[08:01] <theosvoitha> zerl: I did read the page. let me read again.
[08:02] <ducasse> zerl: right, you can probably dig through the apt logs. which version does this give you - 'dpkg -l libstdc++6' ?
[08:02] <clancy> clancy
[08:02] <clancy> hi guys
[08:02] <zerl> theosvoitha: ok just checking your saw it :-)

[08:04] <travel> Hi there need assistance I have no internet on my ubuntu 16.04 desktop I ran an upate abut two weeks ago that stopped my USB WIFI adapter from working if I use it to connect the whole machine freezes. So I started connecting with an Ethernet to my extender and that worked till I ran an update yesterday now that doesn't connect. Any assistance is greatly appreciated.
[08:04] <ducasse> zerl: oh-k. that is definitely not the right version.
[08:04] <zerl> ducasse: so what does that mean?
[08:06] <ducasse> zerl: things that affect libc/libstdc++ are notoriously messy to fix, since they are so essential to the system. have you got any idea where you got that library version from?
[08:06] <zerl> no idea at all
[08:06] <jink> I bound my postfix to specific IPs (both ipv4 and ipv6) and it fails to start during boot, because the interfaces aren't ready, yet.  ("no local interface found for ...")  What should I do?
[08:07] <zerl> ok checking users home directories
[08:08] <zerl> found the user
[08:08] <zerl> found the deb they tried to install
[08:08] <zerl> how do I uninstall it ? dpkg -r?
[08:08] <ducasse> zerl: you could try doenloading the right version from packages.ubuntu.com and forcing it into place, but it might not be the only essential library you need to fix.
[08:08] <ducasse> zerl: oh god, no.
[08:09] <cfhowlett> zerl, wait how did a USER install a package on your system?
[08:09] <zerl> they have sudo rights but clearly not the smarts
[08:09] <cfhowlett> lol.  alright then.
[08:09] <jink> -__-  Sounds like fun
[08:09] <ducasse> zerl: removing that would break the entire system, libstdc++ is _essential_.
[08:10] <zerl> yes but I assume the old one is still there, just this one has taken over
[08:11] <zerl> so teh remove should in theory clean up its links and revert to existing state
[08:11] <ducasse> zerl: you can't have two versions of that installed, afaik.
[08:11] <ducasse> zerl: try 'ls -l /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++*'
[08:13] <RedPenguin> hello all

[08:37] <foodsurprise> hey i see i found a bug report
[08:37] <foodsurprise> can i install ubuntu ontop of NTFS or is that illa dvised
[08:38] <rymax99> Necy, i usually just match RAM for swap

[08:38] <Necy> thanks
[08:38] <foodsurprise> can i make a partition out of free space from windows
[08:39] <foodsurprise> without loosing my files
[08:39] <rymax99> theoretically
[08:39] <ducasse> foodsurprise: yes, but do that in windows
[08:40] <rymax99> I'd highly advise backing up anything you care about
[08:40] <elias_a> foodsurprise: That is the standard way. Back up your data first and then use the Ubuntu installer to shrink your windows partition(s).
[08:40] <anddam> anyone on the nfs "caching" issue?
[08:40] <vlt> Good morning! On our Ubuntu 16.04 MATE desktop _every_ user gets an (annoying) notification whenever someone (else) prints something. How can we disable this?
[08:41] <elias_a> ducasse: Why in windows? I've always done it using installer or Live stick.
[08:41] <ducasse> elias_a: safer to resize the fs there, reputedly
[08:41] <rymax99> agreed
[08:41] <elias_a> ducasse: Ok. I'll buy that :)
[08:42] <ducasse> elias_a: linux ntfs tools are not that great :)
[08:42] <foodsurprise> what program to use to resize the ntfs
[08:42] <foodsurprise> and is about 20 gigs enough
[08:42] <rymax99> foodsurprise, disk management
[08:42] <rymax99> how big is the disk?

[08:46] <foodsurprise> its not showing up in pacman
[08:47] <TomyWork> a word of advice first: do not store any linux application on an ntfs disk
[08:47] <ducasse> foodsurprise: the file manager should automatically see it and mount it on request
[08:47] <TomyWork> not even temporarily
[08:47] <TomyWork> ntfs doesnt properly support linux permissions
[08:47] <rymax99> foodsurprise, sudo fdisk -l

[08:47] <rymax99> mkdir /tmp/mount
[08:48] <Necy> Guys, what does home folder encryption 'look' like. Will it just be a regular login? and is it easy to disable if i wanted to?
[08:48] <rymax99> mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda3 /tmp/mount -o force
[08:48] <foodsurprise> ok thanks
[08:48] <rymax99> should do the trick
[08:49] <TomyWork> foodsurprise https://www.howtogeek.com/236807/how-to-mount-your-windows-10-or-8-system-drive-on-linux/ this sounds somewhat reasonable. But do check twice if you dont understand something
[08:50] <TomyWork> rymax99 do you think it's a good idea to recommend force without explaining what it does?
[08:50] <TomyWork> it might not be a good idea

[08:52] <foodsurprise> dont want to download spywear vs 10
[08:52] <foodsurprise> i mean windows 10
[08:53] <Necy> will it be 'invisable', as in i just login as normal?
[08:53] <rymax99> Necy, encryption? yes
[08:53] <foodsurprise> if i install on HD rather than run liveusb
[08:53] <foodsurprise> it'll be faster right
[08:54] <Necy> ah, cool. its a good idea then. *ticks box* :)
[08:54] <k1l_> foodsurprise: yes
[08:54] <TomyWork> Necy rymax99 depends on the type of encryption
[08:54] <TomyWork> ecryptfs should be invisible
[08:54] <rymax99> right, which is what he'll be using by ticking the box on the install
[08:54] <ducasse> Necy: consider if you really need it, it makes it a lot harder to recover data if something goes wrong
[08:54] <TomyWork> he didnt mention in his question that that is what he wants to do.... or anything at all, really
[08:55] <Necy> thanks.
[08:55] <Necy> thats a good point ducasse
[08:55] <Necy> hmm.
[08:55] <TomyWork> is it a laptop?
[08:56] <rymax99> I encrypt anything mobile, but desktop is per user
[08:56] <Necy> yea laptop
[08:56] <Necy> buts it will be used for uni, u see
[08:56] <rymax99> if you lug it around i'd definitely go for it, but that's me
[08:56] <Necy> so im split
[08:56] <TomyWork> is there any data on it that you cant risk getting into other people's hands?
[08:56] <Necy> not really. more of a precaution
[08:57] <TomyWork> if so, i recommend full disk encryption :)
[08:57] <Necy> but the data recovery aspect as got me second thinking
[08:57] <Necy> :D yea
[08:57] <Necy> i would proably backup
[08:58] <Necy> hmm
[08:58] <Necy> if it was easy to revert..
[08:59] <Necy> say if i wanted to that is
[08:59] <ducasse> Necy: you'll need to copy all your data out to revert
[08:59] <Necy> ahh.
[09:00] <Necy> can it be applied later on easily?
[09:00] <ducasse> Necy: the ecryptfs package comes  with a script to encrypt your homedir
[09:02] <rymax99> Any way to make a user a system user after creation other than editing shadow?
[09:03] <pagios> i am tying to compile a driver and getting : module.h:4:32: fatal error: asm-generic/module.h: No such file or directory lot of those, i dont want to copy module.h to same dir and #include "module.h" can i point gcc to /usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-4-common in some way?
[09:04] <k1l_> rymax99: dont edit shadow file. just put that user into the sudo group
[09:04] <akik> rymax99: the uid/gid is set in /etc/passwd, so you can change it there. remember to chown your files afterwards
[09:05] <k1l_> rymax99: hmm, i might have misunderstood what you want
[09:05] <rymax99> k1l_, i was gonna say :P, just to make a user a system user
[09:05] <akik> i thought rymax99 wanted to have the uid below the system id limit
[09:06] <rymax99> actually yeah, i guess that'd be the issue is the uid
[09:06] <Ankammarao_> Hi All
[09:06] <rymax99> so i guess the answer is no it's not possible without editing the uid and changing ownership
[09:07] <vlt> Good morning! On our Ubuntu 16.04 MATE desktop _every_ user gets an (annoying) notification whenever someone (else) prints something. How can we disable this?
[09:07] <Ankammarao_> ubuntu server is very very slow and some times taking time for login, can any one tell the reason behind it
[09:08] <akik> rymax99: the limits for system ids are 100 to 999 (/etc/adduser.conf)
[09:11] <k1l_> Ankammarao_: does dmesg tell something obvious?
[09:11] <rymax99> off topic just found out i work today after nerding out all night
[09:12] <rymax99> Shoot me.
[09:12] <Ankammarao_> k1l_: no don't think so
[09:12] <k1l_> Ankammarao_: "dmesg | nc termbin.com 9999"
[09:13] <k1l_> show the outputurl here
[09:14] <Ankammarao_> k1l_:http://termbin.com/6yyl
[09:17] <k1l_> Ankammarao_: frist obvious thing on reboot is that it takes some time to bring up the raid.
[09:19] <Ankammarao_> k1l_: yes, its taking long time to up after reboot

[09:25] <MacroMan> Is there a generic way to find the location of a Binary if it's in PATH?
[09:25] <dsoyet> echo $(which name_of_binary)
[09:26] <ikevin> just which <binary>
[09:26] <llutz> dsoyet: some cat/grep missing :)
=== su is now known as Guest94778
[09:27] <MacroMan> ikevin, Cool thanks. I knew there must have been a easy way. dsoyet, that just echoed the programs output
[09:31] <dsoyet> `dpkg --search $(which <binary>)`, find a binary belong to which package.
[09:32] <dnel> hi, does anyone know a way to stop tmux from being killed when my SSH session drops?
[09:32] <ikevin> dnel, use screen
[09:32] <dnel> does that have some exception, ikevin?
[09:33] <mahakal> guys i lost data on my hdd while installing ubuntu16.04 .How can i recover it
[09:33] <EriC^^> mahakal: testdisk
[09:33] <ikevin> dnel, i don't understand, what do you mean by exception?
[09:33] <EriC^^> !datarecovery | mahakal
[09:33] <EriC^^> !recoverdata | mahakal
[09:34] <mahakal> ok..But is it a GUI tool ?
[09:34] <EriC^^> mahakal: no
[09:34] <k1l_> mahakal: you mean you installed ubuntu and on that way it delete partitions and wrote new partitions on to the disk with ubuntu?
[09:34] <dnel> ikevin: the policy is that all processes will get killed on disconnect, unless screen is special it will get killed just the same
[09:34] <ikevin> mahakal, it's an interactive tool
[09:34] <EriC^^> mahakal: it's an ncurses tool (gui for terminal)
[09:34] <k1l_> dnel: no
[09:34] <ikevin> dnel, no
[09:35] <k1l_> dnel: screen keeps all programs running since it doesnt tell the programs that you lost connection
[09:35] <k1l_> !screen | dnel
[09:35] <ubottu> dnel: screen is a window manager for terminal sessions, also useful over SSH. The 'byobu' package provides very useful additional utilities. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Screen
[09:35] <geirha> dnel: Yes, screen (the client) dies, but the session will live on, and can be reattached next time you log in
[09:36] <mahakal> Eric^^: no actually i was running ubuntu14.04. while booting i accidently press F11. And dell recovery did the horrible job.tHEN i thought to install 16.04
[09:36] <dnel> just tested screen, exactly the same as tmux, it wont reattach
[09:36] <EriC^^> dnel: http://askubuntu.com/questions/8653/how-to-keep-processes-running-after-ending-ssh-session
[09:36] <mahakal> so now i want to recover the images ?
[09:36] <geirha> I'd expect tmux to behave the same, but haven't tried tmux yet
[09:36] <anddam> what can result in directories and export on an nfs server to be different? I restarted the nfs-kernel-server
[09:36] <ikevin> dnel, screen -S tmux, when in screen, start your program, then dettach using ctrl+A+D
[09:37] <EriC^^> mahakal: pastebin "sudo parted -l"
[09:37] <akik> dnel: there was a problem with systemd that it killed all user processes on logout but i thought that was fixed already
[09:37] <EriC^^> mahakal: testdisk can do that
[09:37] <ikevin> dnel, then disconnect, reconnect and do screen -x tmux
[09:37] <mahakal> ok
[09:37] <dnel> ikevin: I literally just tried it, as soon as I restart the SSH session with a detacted screen it dies
[09:37] <linocisco> hi all
[09:37] <ikevin> oO
[09:38] <linocisco> how can I set alarm with sound when laptop battery level is 20% or 100%?
[09:38] <akik> dnel: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=825394, check /etc/systemd/logind.conf for KillUserProcesses=
[09:38] <ubottu> Debian bug 825394 in systemd "systemd kill background processes after user logs out" [Normal,Fixed]
[09:38] <k1l_> dnel: what did you try exactly? i guess we are missing some parts
[09:39] <mahakal> Eric^^: pasting is not accepted
[09:39] <dnel> 1. open screen, 2. detatch, 3. re-attach OK, 4. detatch screen 5. drop SSH, 6. restart SSH 7. reattached screen, no session available
[09:39] <k1l_> akik: that is set to no and commented on ubuntu by default
[09:39] <EriC^^> mahakal: what?
[09:40] <mahakal> i am going to try termbin
[09:40] <EriC^^> mahakal: ok
[09:41] <llutz> dnel: how do you reattach screen?
[09:41] <mahakal> Eric^^: http://termbin.com/ls2v
[09:41] <dnel> screen -r
[09:41] <ikevin> dnel, try screen -x
[09:41] <llutz> dnel: or screen -dr
[09:41] <mahakal> Eric^^: i am runnig kali also
[09:41] <mahakal> Eric^^: dual boot
[09:42] <dnel> There is no screen to be attached.
[09:42] <dnel> ^^ literally the ouput
[09:42] <k1l_> dnel: screen -ls
[09:42] <EriC^^> mahakal: ok try installing testdisk
[09:43] <dnel> No Sockets found in /var/run/screen/S-david.
[09:43] <mahakal> EriC^^: i have installed testdisk.Just reading manual for more stuff
[09:44] <linocisco> hi, who is answering me?
[09:44] <EriC^^> mahakal: try sudo testdisk, no log, no log, choose the partition table type gpt, then analyze, quick search
[09:44] <EriC^^> mahakal: press "p" to list the files of the partition
[09:47] <ljc> i've connected to my box via ssh, but these sessions are long gone and done
[09:48] <ljc> but i do `ps a` and processes are still running
[09:48] <ljc> is there a neat way to terminate an old ssh session/processes?
[09:48] <Slown> Hello everybody
[09:48] <Slown> I'm wondering if I should install the server version or the minimal one
[09:48] <Slown> I'm using and old pc like a home server
[09:48] <Slown> to share files
[09:49] <akik> ljc: there's a way to kill all of your user processes but i'm not sure if you want that
[09:49] <Slown> and provide some other services like dns and apache
[09:49] <mahakal> Eric^^: i have completed command till "pressin P" what next?
[09:49] <Slown> what do you advice me fox ?
[09:49] <ljc> mm..which user? :x
[09:49] <ikevin> Slown, install base system then install package ubuntu-server
[09:49] <akik> ljc: processes owned by your user account
[09:49] <Slown> base system ?
[09:49] <ljc> that's not ideal but i'm curious
[09:49] <Slown> there is an ubuntu server iso
[09:49] <Slown> should I use it ?
[09:50] <k1l_> Slown: if you want the server why not installing the server iso?
[09:50] <ikevin> yes you can, so you asked about minimal one
[09:50] <akik> ljc: the command is "kill -9 -1" but remember it kills all the processes running under your user account
[09:50] <EriC^^> mahakal: does it show the files?
[09:50] <Slown> k1l_, it's not a production server
=== hroi is now known as hrob
[09:50] <Slown> it's just a home server
[09:50] <k1l_> Slown: that doesnt matter
[09:51] <Slown> and it's an old pc
[09:51] <Slown> so np with ubuntu server ?
[09:51] <k1l_> that doesnt matter, too :)
[09:51] <ljc> akik: thanks :)
[09:51] <mahakal> Eric^^: i cant understand it
[09:51] <Slown> thanks
[09:51] <k1l_> server.iso doesnt mean its only for new server hardware in hosting locations :)
[09:52] <linocisco> hi all
[09:52] <linocisco> how can I set alarm with sound when laptop battery level is 20% or 100%?
[09:53] <mahakal> Eric^^: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/24101194/
[09:53] <Slown> Is there any advantages installing the server version instead of the minimal one ?
[09:54] <EriC^^> mahakal: press q, pastebin the partitions it found
[09:54] <EriC^^> Slown: server supports uefi for 1
[09:55] <Slown> it's and old pc with bios and x86 architecture
[09:55] <Slown> :p
[09:56] <mahakal> EriC^^: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/24101208/
[09:57] <sojusnik> On Ubuntu Gnome 16.10 the Gnome-Shell is sporadically crashing after unlocking the lock-screen. Restarting it (Alt+F2, then r) helps, but gets annoying over time. I'm searching for a way to debug this, especially with logs, but don't know where to find them. /var/crash/ (apport saves its reports there) also doesn't contain any files regarding the gnome-shell crash. Thanks for helping!
[09:57] <dnel> akik: that bug report looks like the right kind of thing but the solution didn't work for me unfortunately
[09:57] <EriC^^> mahakal: try the second partition
[09:58] <ikevin> Slown, if you install minimal one you will just have packages what you need
[09:58] <EriC^^> mahakal: whatever you do, dont write anything, it'll alter the partition table
[09:58] <mahakal> EriC^^: deeper search?
[09:58] <mvvvv> sojusnik, do you have journalctl command ?
[09:58] <Slown> the packages I need ?
[09:58] <EriC^^> mahakal: no, on the second partition press p
[09:58] <Slown> can you explain this further please ?
[09:58] <EriC^^> MS Data                  1050624  630196223  629145600
[09:58] <k1l_> Slown: use the server iso
[09:59] <mort> hey
[09:59] <mahakal> ooh ok
[09:59] <Slown> lol, someone told me to use the server version and another the minimal one
[09:59] <k1l_> Slown: the minimal iso requires more knowledge from the admin about what pacakges the system need etc. the server.iso is setup to work
[09:59] <Slown> I'm confused guys :x
[09:59] <Slown> that's a good answer k1l_
[10:00] <Slown> the ubuntu server is like using Debian, right ?
[10:00] <mort> after `dpkg --add-architecture armhf`, `apt-get update` says all the armhf repos 404
[10:00] <mort> e.g "Err:5 http://eu-west-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/main armhf Packages
[10:00] <mort> "
[10:00] <k1l_> Slown: no. its a server iso. it doesnt have a desktop installed
[10:00] <mort> I kind of need some armhf stuff, any idea what's going on?
[10:00] <mahakal> EriC^^: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/24101218/
[10:00] <Slown> yeah I know that, it's similar to debian without a desktop
[10:00] <Slown> I mean
[10:01] <akik> dnel: do you have a .bash_logout script which kills processes?
=== redwood is now known as Cubensis
[10:01] <k1l_> Slown: in a way, yes. ubuntu is based on debian. but then changes some stuff.
[10:02] <aarannnnn> Hi, can someone explain the following command to me " *.* /dev/tty12"
=== Cubensis is now known as RadiantNova
[10:02] <Slown> ok great
[10:02] <RadiantNova> hmm
[10:02] <EriC^^> mahakal: what are you hoping to do?
[10:02] <Slown> thank you guys, I'll go with ubuntu server version
[10:02] <RadiantNova> i dont remember what nickname i registered
[10:02] <akik> dnel: run "screen -ls" when you have screen running. does it show the socket?
[10:02] <EriC^^> mahakal: recover the old ubuntu?
=== RadiantNova is now known as Redwood
[10:02] <k1l_> Redwood: #freenode for help with that
=== Redwood is now known as Cubensis
[10:03] <mahakal> EriC^^: no i had some very important imagest worth 3 GB and some Books in pdf format .I want to recover that only
[10:03] <Cubensis> crap
[10:03] <Cubensis> ugh
[10:03] <mahakal> Eric^^: images are important for me .
[10:04] <dnel> akik: bash_logout does nothing about processes. the screen -ls command shows the socket before restarting the SSH session but not after
[10:04] <EriC^^> aarannnnn: that command doesn't make sense
=== Cubensis is now known as RadiantNova
[10:04] <aarannnnn> I know
[10:04] <EriC^^> aarannnnn: *.* just expands whatever is in your current dir that has something.something in it
[10:04] <RadiantNova> there we go
[10:04] <aarannnnn> The question is "What entry can be added to the syslog.conf file to have all syslog messages generated by a system displayed on console 12?"
[10:05] <aarannnnn> and it says that *.* /dev/tty12 is the correct answer
[10:05] <EriC^^> aarannnnn: that must be some config then to place somewhere, no idea here
[10:05] <EriC^^> mahakal: ok, did you used to have a separate /home partition?
[10:05] <mahakal> yup
[10:06] <EriC^^> mahakal: ok press q
[10:06] <EriC^^> then select the partition below it with p
[10:06] <EriC^^> my guess is that it's your home partition
[10:06] <llutz> aarannnnn: thats a line for /etc/syslog.conf not a command
[10:06] <mahakal> ok
[10:07] <aarannnnn> Ok but why does it achieve what it does I do not understand the command it jsut looks like anything goes to /dev/tty12 ?
[10:07] <akik> dnel: how do you see the socket if you're not connected to your server with ssh?
[10:07] <aarannnnn> is that correct
[10:07] <mahakal> Eric^^: i have kali linux also some 300 gb away:what to do next
[10:07] <EriC^^> mahakal: so that's the stuff you want to recover?
[10:08] <dnel> akik: I see it before I disconnect SSH
[10:08] <llutz> aarannnnn: yes, "send all facility.priority to /dev/xxxx" it means. read man syslog.conf
[10:08] <mahakal> EriC^^: i installed it after that happen.so i would like to avoid that area while recovering
[10:08] <akik> dnel: try opening two simultaneous sessions on your server and leave the screen running on one of them
[10:09] <mahakal> EriC^^: i have pressed P: what now ?
[10:09] <EriC^^> mahakal: do you see your user name?
[10:09] <EriC^^> mahakal: use the arrows to traverse the directories
[10:09] <EriC^^> right and left
[10:09] <dnel> akik: I am on IRC via SSH onto the same server, this session was up throughout the last test
[10:10] <akik> dnel: so the screen that you had your irc client running under didn't die?
[10:10] <mahakal> EriC^^: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/24101242/
[10:10] <dnel> akik: I'm not currently running IRC inside screen or tmux
[10:10] <akik> dnel: well.. maybe try tht
[10:11] <EriC^^> mahakal: ok, head over to the home dir and figure out which one is your old install between the 2 partitions you just entered
[10:11] <akik> dnel: i have to say this is not normal behaviour
[10:11] <akik> dnel: maybe your server admin has created some kind of process clean-up
[10:12] <dnel> akik: I tested with two sessions at a time, the socket is visible from the 2nd session until SSH disconnects on the 1st session
[10:13] <akik> dnel: does the 2nd session screen keep on running or is it killed?
[10:13] <mahakal> EriC^^: i am getting my user name.how to search that folder and copying the things it found?
[10:14] <dnel> akik: the 2nd session is completely unaffected by the 1st
[10:14] <akik> dnel: is the screen killed or not? do you see it die?
[10:15] <dnel> akik: when 1st detatches the session, 2nd sees it is detatched, when 1st disconnects SSH 2nd only sees it's own screen socket 1st's disappears
[10:15] <akik> dnel: one option could be that the server free disk space becomes full thus creating strange problems
[10:16] <dnel> akik: no there is plenty of disk space and the filesystems are all rw
[10:16] <akik> dnel: do you see the attached screen session die?
[10:17] <dnel> akik: I don't kill the SSH session while it is attached, I a detatching file
[10:17] <dnel> detatching first^, stupid keyboard
[10:19] <dnel> akik: ok, I kill the SSH with screen attached, it persists for a few seconds then disappears
[10:19] <akik> dnel: this is a bit hard for me to understand. let's try this: 1) open a ssh connection to the server and create a screen session 2) open another ssh session to the server and logout while observing the screen session
[10:19] <k1l_> dnel: and this is a standard ubuntu server 16.04?
[10:19] <dnel> akik: that is what I am doing
[10:19] <akik> dnel: do you see the screen session die?
[10:19] <dnel> k1l_: it is KDE Neon, ubuntu desktop base
[10:20] <k1l_> hmm, hopefully the kde guys dont mess with the base system that much
[10:20] <dnel> akik: yes, but it takes a few seconds
[10:20] <akik> dnel: any error messages there when it happens?
[10:20] <dnel> k1l_: afaik it is standard ubuntu underneath
[10:21] <dnel> akik: none, it looks like a clean session SIGTERM
[10:22] <akik> dnel: can you create a new user on the server and test with it?
[10:22] <mcphail> It isn't happening to me on vanilla 16.04
[10:24] <dnel> akik: syslog shows "Stopped Session 12 of user"... a few seconds after killing SSH
[10:25] <k1l_> dnel: i know kde guys change a lot of qt and i think they do change some systemd stuff too. maybe they changed logind stuff
[10:27] <dnel> akik: I get the same with a different user account
[10:27] <akik> dnel: try looking at "journalctl -xe" if it says something about that
[10:28] <dnel> k1l_: possibly but not likely, if I can't find a solution though I'll certainly ask them
[10:29] <k1l_> dnel: did you try to set KillUserProcesses=no ?
[10:30] <dnel> akik: just messages about shutting down user manager and user slice after the session closed
[10:30] <dnel> k1l_: yeah, tried that and rebooted, that is currently set
[10:31] <dnel> k1l_: interestingly the commends on logind.conf say that the commented lines are compile-time defaults, and =no is set there so that should be the settings even before I uncommented the line
[10:32] <akik> dnel: do you have systemd-run program installed? there might be a solution at the bottom of this page http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/171503/tmux-session-killed-when-disconnecting-from-ssh
[10:33] <akik> dnel: systemd-run --scope --user screen
[10:33] <k1l_> dnel: yes. but since kde needs new systemd/logind stuff for new features from plasma etc. i am not sure that its the ubuntu default, still.
[10:33] <EriC^^> mahakal: press "C" or "c" , one is for copying selected files the other for the whole dir i think
[10:34] <dnel> akik: bingo! that solution worked
[10:35] <akik> yay systemd
[10:35] <dnel> akik: ...bringing the year of the BSD desktop ever closer
[10:35] <mahakal> EriC^^: how to copy to pendrive
[10:35] <akik> dnel: probably kde neon changed something. that's maybe why non ubuntu flavours are not supported here
[10:37] <EriC^^> mahakal: after pressing c selected the destination dir
[10:37] <EriC^^> mahakal: mount the pen drive first
[10:38] <dnel> akik: yeah I understand, I will test this on pure ubuntu though too when I get a chance, perhaps it's a bug waiting in the pipeline
[10:38] <dnel> akik: not bug, a "feature" :)
[10:38]  * dnel raises systemd flag
[10:41] <dnel> I'll leave it there for now anyway, thanks akik, k1l_

[10:56] <k1l_> cliffer: file a bug or request on launchpad.net but if there is not a real concern there wont be a SRU
[10:57] <cliffer> SRU?
[10:58] <k1l_> cliffer: stable release update. ubuntu doesnt update the version after release. it does patch the version for heavy bugs and security issues.
[10:58] <k1l_> so if you want a new version, just because its new, that will not happen.
[10:59] <Xun95> hi
[11:00] <cliffer> mhh, fail2ban does not support IPv6 in current repo but in upstream. users should know about it but you can also declare it as a security issue

I am not getting internet connectivity on my machine. When I down admn0, then I am getting internet connectivity. How do I get connectivity with both interfaces up?
[11:44] <kangaroo72> does it mean, that I have to install these restricted formats?
[11:45] <MonkeyDust> kangaroo72  it's a start
[11:45] <kangaroo72> it's installing :-)
[11:45] <k1l_> kangaroo72: did you put a blueray into the tray?
[11:45] <kangaroo72> yihaa ;-)
[11:47] <alessandroalb> i have problem, why not ?  Use Ubuntu 16.04 with gnome-shell 3.18.5. Sometime, random, after login i keep screen empty (green) with only cursor, Where can see, log i mean, to understand something ? Or there is other solution ?
[11:47] <kangaroo72> it's installing flash-plugin too?! I just want to burn ....
[11:48] <jink> Ubuntu 16.10 / QEMU VPS: I bound my postfix to specific IPs (both ipv4 and ipv6) and it fails to start during boot, because the interfaces aren't ready, yet.  ("no local interface found for ...")  What should I do?
[11:48] <MonkeyDust> flash is oe of the restricted formats

[11:56] <RadiantNova> umm
[11:56] <RadiantNova> where is the "super key" on the keyboard?
[11:57] <ikevin> RadiantNova, it's the "windows" key
[11:57] <RadiantNova> doesnt work
[11:57] <Walex> Have some Ubuntu repositories been hacked? I find on my system kernel 3.13.0-111 installed but it seems to be "unofficial" and no longer in the repo.
[11:58] <Walex> That was installed by 'unattended-upgrade'
[12:01] <k1l_> RadiantNova: what doesnt work?
[12:02] <RadiantNova> using super key +f2
[12:02] <k1l_> Walex: there was a security update which seems to have  pushed the 110 build
[12:02] <RadiantNova> the super key supposedly being the windows key
[12:02] <k1l_> RadiantNova: what should that do?
[12:02] <MonkeyDust> Walex  what's the ouput of    cat /etc/issue
[12:02] <RadiantNova> i dont remember
[12:02] <RadiantNova> try it
[12:02] <RadiantNova> let me know
[12:02] <k1l_> RadiantNova: i guess you mean "alt+f2"
[12:02] <Walex> MonkeyDust: that's fairly irrelevant...
[12:03] <RadiantNova> dont belittle me
[12:03] <RadiantNova> please
[12:03] <RadiantNova> im new
[12:03] <RadiantNova> by the way
[12:03] <RadiantNova> walex
[12:03] <RadiantNova> your statement imparted no knowledge
[12:03] <RadiantNova> so its even more irrelevant
[12:03] <RadiantNova> than mine
[12:04] <k1l_> RadiantNova: super+f2 is not a thing. so i wonder why you asking for this. and please dont use enter that often. that is annoying on irc
[12:04] <k1l_> RadiantNova: ok, good luck with that attitude.
[12:04] <RadiantNova> im sorry

[12:05] <Walex> RadiantNova: vertical scroll space in IRC channels is an expensive resource.
[12:05] <RadiantNova> my attitudes not the best, its alright though. you guys are trying to be elitists downtalking to newbies
[12:05] <RadiantNova> expensive to who?
[12:06] <Walex> RadiantNova: to people who try to follow a conversation interleaved with many others.
[12:06] <MonkeyDust> RadiantNova  if you keep your question(s) in one line, they're easier to follow an repeat, if needed
[12:06] <MonkeyDust> and*
[12:06] <RadiantNova> alright, let me look up in the documentation where i saw this "super key +f2", because that was a first for me too

[12:16] <RadiantNova> linux snobs
[12:17] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[12:18] <Necy> HI. I installed kubuntu today but i cannot get my wifi working. It might be because of secureboot.
[12:19] <Guest72033> ls
[12:19] <RadiantNova> walex, scroll space costs nothing to generate
[12:20] <RadiantNova> well since your running windows 95 Walex, i take that back, yea i suppose it would take a lot of your resources
[12:21] <RadiantNova> thats true IRC high-class snobbin
[12:21] <RadiantNova> do you have a linux limousine Walex?
[12:22] <RadiantNova> does your toilet have linux engraved on the seat in 14k gold?
[12:22] <RadiantNova> dont give me your shit about scroll lines
[12:22] <RadiantNova> get a life

[12:27] <RadiantNova> i read through it like a EULA
[12:27] <RadiantNova> done
[12:27] <RadiantNova> actually most EULA's are more interesting than those guidelines
[12:28] <RadiantNova> ive read lawbooks more interesting
[12:29] <cfhowlett> Necy, if your kubuntu system boots, then secureboot is highly unlikely to effect wifi
[12:30] <Necy> <cfhowlett> i can always give it a go booting with it disabled and see
[12:30] <causative> what files in your home directory should be owned by a user other than yourself?
[12:31] <cfhowlett> Necy, sounds legit.
[12:31] <causative> like does unity need files owned by a different user... I just chowned all files in my home directory to myself because I migrated files from a different computer, but now I'm wondering if I need to fix ownership
[12:32] <RadiantNova> hey guys Walex is starting a new grassroots movement on IRC, he's gonna save the environment by telling people to use less scroll lines!
[12:32] <RadiantNova> the less scroll lines, the less CO2 emissions!
[12:32] <RadiantNova> we'll save the rainforests just by using less scroll lines

[12:40] <kangaroo72> on one bd
[12:40] <Necy> its 16.10 hateball
[12:41] <hateball> Necy: as Plasma in 16.04 is rather... volatile, you'll want to use kubuntu backports PPA or stuff like that might happen regardless of secure boot or no.
[12:41] <hateball> Necy: ah ok. well, try a reboot I guess. it still acts up in 16.10 :p
[12:41] <hamza> I have some troubles with the Network-manager
[12:42] <k3nz0> Hello, I'm facing a problem with ubuntu 15.04. When I leave for TTY1 and want to come back to GUI mode the screen shows "Power Saving Mode" and goes offline.
[12:42] <k3nz0> Any clue ?
[12:42] <MonkeyDust> k3nz0  for one, 15.04 is no longer supported
[12:42] <cfhowlett> k3nz0, 15.04 is quite dead and not supported here or elsewhere.  install a  supported version
[12:42] <hateball> k3nz0: If you are really on 15.04 it is EOL
[12:43] <hateball> heh

[12:43] <ubottu> hamza: Please elaborate; your question or issue may not seem clear or detailed enough for people to help you.

[12:44] <hamza> is there another to access my vpn since I cannot have the configuration files
[12:46] <kangaroo72> I just read to install ppa "cdr-tools"
[12:46] <k3nz0> I don't actually think it's because of 15.04
[12:46] <cfhowlett> again k3nz0 15.04 is not supported, so no point discussing it.  upgrade.
[12:46] <k3nz0> Also I cannot change to Ubuntu 16.04 as it's not my PC
[12:46] <k3nz0> thanks anyways :-)
[12:47] <kangaroo72> but apt-update ends in ... 0% [Verbindung mit dl.google.com (2a00:1450:4001:814::200e)]
[12:47] <kangaroo72> weird
[12:47] <k3nz0> Apart from ubuntu 15, does any one knows where this "bug" comes from ?
[12:47] <k3nz0> When I leave for TTY1 and want to come back to GUI mode the screen shows "Power Saving Mode" and goes offline.
[12:48] <Necy> ouch. only loads desktop in secureboot it seems
[12:48] <hamza> how can I add a vpn network in network-manager I had already installed the openvpn moudule
[12:48] <k3nz0> But when I go back to TTY1 it works okay, TTY1 works okay
[12:49] <MrMonkey31> out of curiosity, and cause of immediate need also, is there a prescribed method to waking up google chrome after stopping his processes one by one?
[12:50] <RadiantNova> set an alarm bye google chromes bed
[12:50] <RadiantNova> since your referring to google chrome as a person
[12:50] <MrMonkey31> question applies to any prog with tons of processes (~20), and refers to preventing dataloss/retaining stability
[12:50] <RadiantNova> i'd imagine he must have a bed
[12:50] <RadiantNova> and an outlet nearby
[12:50] <RadiantNova> for the alarm clock
[12:51] <RadiantNova> does that answer your question?
[12:51] <MrMonkey31> RadiantNova: but what of dataloss?
[12:52] <r0ute> I find the easiest way to prevent the dataloss is by not killing the processes in the first place.
[12:52] <RadiantNova> grab a flash light and look for it?
[12:53] <MrMonkey31> hey!  what's this talk of KILLing?  & good morning :]
[12:53] <r0ute> Good afternoon

[14:45] <kubast2> Hey I have a fan on /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/pwm1 How can I turn on manual control without using pwmconfig
[14:46] <kubast2> when I run pwmconfig the fans get to max speed ,but the chassis fans don't really get back to standard speed
[14:46] <kubast2> so I'm not sure if it really works

[14:52] <egyptian_> hi - if i have 4 nics in my interfaces file .. can i just add source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d to the very bottom of the file? or do i have to add it in for each nic?
[14:55] <Christoph_vW> how do I get rid of a wrong DNS server entry?    "nmcli dev show"   shows me that IP6.DNS[1] has an invalid/old entry
[14:58] <BluesKaj> Christoph_vW, which ubuntu?
[14:58] <Christoph_vW> Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
[14:59] <MonkeyDust> Christoph_vW  is this useful https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/dns-troubleshooting.html
[14:59] <finexbeer> how cancel cache on ubuntu
[15:01] <BluesKaj> in your text editor with root permissions, open /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head a,nd remove the dns nameserver or replace it with the correct one, Christoph_vW
[15:01] <OerHeks> finexbeer, "how cancel cache on ubuntu"  explain?
[15:01] <BluesKaj> Christoph_vW, and ignore the warninfg
[15:01] <MonkeyDust> cache can be disabled, is what i read here
[15:01] <Christoph_vW> etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head  is empty
[15:02] <OerHeks> MonkeyDust, depends what context ..
[15:02] <MonkeyDust> OerHeks  yes, that's why i'm not posting a link
[15:03] <MonkeyDust> finexbeer  what OerHeks says, what's the context
[15:04] <BluesKaj> Christoph_vW, and ignore the warninfg /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head
[15:05] <Christoph_vW> BluesKaj: problem is: nmcli shows 4 IPv6 DNS servers, but only the 1st is wrong
[15:05] <Christoph_vW> and I don't know where it got them from
[15:06] <BluesKaj> ok , Christoph_vW what does /etc/resolv.conf,  show ?
[15:06] <Christoph_vW> nameserver 127.0.1.1
[15:09] <alkisg> Christoph_vW: how are you configuring your network, e.g. with network-manager and dhcp IP?
[15:10] <Christoph_vW> alkisg: good question - I gave it a static IPv4 address in setup and IPv6 should be handled by DHCPv6
[15:10] <Christoph_vW> so I guess network manager is handling this now
[15:10] <alkisg> What's the output of this? grep . /run/resolvconf/interface/*
[15:10] <Christoph_vW> but dhclient -6 takes forever
[15:11] <Fooster> one of my machines updated to 4.4.0-65 which is apparentlty broken
[15:11] <Fooster> how do I fix this?
[15:11] <Christoph_vW> just "search DOMAIN.local" and "nameserver 127.0.1.1"
[15:11] <Christoph_vW> and the DHCPv6 server doesn't have the wrong DNS server anymore since some days
[15:11] <Christoph_vW> but the client won't update his server list
[15:12] <alkisg> Christoph_vW, and the output of this? grep -ri dns= /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
[15:12] <Christoph_vW> alkisg: nothing
[15:12] <alkisg> Try with sudo in front, sorry
[15:12] <Christoph_vW> it is not in the connection profile  - it shows only on the device
[15:13] <alkisg> You should get permission denied
[15:13] <Christoph_vW> alkisg: I already did sudo -i
[15:13] <alkisg> So if you disable ipv6 in the nm tab, you no longer get the wrong dns servers?
[15:13] <alkisg> You think they come from ipv6?
[15:13] <Christoph_vW> alkisg: cli only - no gui
[15:13] <alkisg> Note that if a lease expires after 1 month, there's no reason for the client to fetch new dns server entries
[15:14] <finexbeer> how can you cancel cache on ubuntu useng terminal
[15:14] <finexbeer> ??
[15:14] <Christoph_vW> the lease should expire after 12 hours
[15:14] <Fooster> cancel cache?
[15:14] <alkisg> Christoph_vW: output of this? put your iface name there... /usr/lib/klibc/bin/ipconfig  -n eth0
[15:14] <alkisg> Does it list correct dns servers?
=== Spontex is now known as Guest20846
[15:15] <OerHeks> finexbeer, "how cancel cache on ubuntu"  explain?
[15:15] <alkisg> This only does a test request, it doesn't apply it
[15:15] <Christoph_vW> alkisg: yes, but that's for IPv4 only
[15:15] <Fooster> any ideas how to get rid of this 4.4.0-65 abortion?
[15:15] <OerHeks> Fooster, reinstall the kernel perhaps?
[15:15] <Christoph_vW> alkisg: my problem is just the wrong IPv6 dns server
[15:16] <Fooster> oerheks not sure how to do that wiht gce... can't get to grub directly?
[15:16] <ikevin> Christoph_vW, how ipv6 is configured?
[15:16] <Christoph_vW> DHCPv6
[15:16] <alkisg> Christoph_vW: you're sure you didn't put it somewhere static, e.g. in /etc/network/interfaces, right?
[15:16] <ikevin> ok, so dns server maybe come from dhcp request
[15:17] <OerHeks> Fooster, gce? hold shift @ boot to enter grub menu
[15:17] <Christoph_vW> alkisg: I cannot find a trace of it anywhere
[15:17] <Fooster> google compute engine
[15:17] <Christoph_vW>  etc/network/interfaces is nearly empty
[15:17] <alkisg> Christoph_vW: ah, you could even run sudo grep -r <ip> /etc
[15:18] <alkisg> And put the wrong ip there
[15:18] <ikevin> do you have anything in interfaces.d ?
[15:18] <finexbeer> a what to clear some space on my hardisk and a wanna cancel cache
[15:18] <ikevin> finexbeer, which cache?
[15:19] <Christoph_vW> ikevin: no, nothing
[15:19] <iresf> webadmin.nsf: The server admin database can be accessed remotely. ?  what this mean  ?
[15:19] <Christoph_vW> alkisg: no result
[15:19] <scottjl> finexbeer: what is it you're trying to accomplish?
[15:19] <OerHeks> Fooster, as you pay for it, ask https://cloud.google.com/support/  ??
[15:19] <Fooster> their support is garbage
[15:20] <Christoph_vW> "dhclient -6 -v eno1" gets a new v6 lease but the wrong DNS entry stays
[15:20] <alkisg> Christoph_vW: maybe you saved the config but didn't apply it? What kind of dhcp server do you have?
[15:21] <Christoph_vW> Windows Server 2016 Datacenter
[15:21] <alkisg> Did you restart the dhcp service? I don't know what it takes for that to happen under windows, there's also a #windows channel as it sounds like a server-side issue
[15:21] <Christoph_vW> alkisg: I did
[15:22] <Christoph_vW> and I don't get the old IP on windows clients
[15:22] <alkisg> Christoph_vW: try dhclient -r first, to release the old lease
[15:22] <MonkeyDust> finexbeer  start with   rm -r ~/.cache
[15:23] <Choups> guys i need some help
[15:23] <MonkeyDust> Choups  let's hear it, in one line
[15:23] <Christoph_vW> alkisg: didn't help
[15:24] <Choups> just started a new box, ubuntu 16 lts, installed apache and php7, but now when i upload a hello world php file, the php doesnt run, and it apears as a text file
[15:24] <Choups> what am i missing?
[15:24] <Christoph_vW> too bad it doesn't display where it got the addr from
[15:24] <Christoph_vW> maybe it is from a router advertisement
[15:25] <alkisg> Christoph_vW: well, next thing I would try would be a live cd, and if it happens there too, I would use tcpdump to see where it got it from
[15:25] <Choups> oh and i restarted the apache.. just saying
[15:26] <alkisg> Choups: you need the apache php module, not just the language
[15:26] <ikevin> Christoph_vW, you can disable ra
[15:26] <alkisg> Choups: follow the lamp installation guide from ubuntu wiki
[15:26] <Christoph_vW> bingo
[15:26] <Christoph_vW> it came from a RA
[15:26] <Choups> ok alkisg
[15:26] <Choups> ty
[15:27] <Christoph_vW> would be cool when nmcli would display where it got it settings from...
