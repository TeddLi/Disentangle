[09:57] <Agrajag> Did you actually compare it to running in windos on the same machine?
[09:57] <Quarupt> can anyone help me write an ircd.conf
[09:57] <Agrajag> the directx renderer for the UT2 engine is much better than the GL one
[09:58] <Scooter> I just play games in linux for the iorny of it all
[09:58] <cowbud> haha
[09:58] <cowbud> Agrajag: if I get 60 frames or 120 it is still smooth enough to play but yes windows plays better I agree..
[09:58] <Agrajag> hahahah 60
[09:58] <Agrajag> I get 45 in windows
[09:59] <Agrajag> half that in linux

[10:02] <Agrajag> yeah

[10:03] <Agrajag> oh
[10:03] <Scooter> hi 8)
[10:03] <cowbud> ahah
[10:03] <Scooter> it is precompiled imagees , stage 3 i think it is called
[10:04] <Agrajag> yes, I know
[10:04] <Scooter> I have never used it because i like Debian :)
[10:04] <Agrajag> I used gentoo for almost a year

[10:06] <topyli> Agrajag: other distros have source packages too. you can always update from them :)
[10:06] <Agrajag> topyli: ew
[10:06] <farruinn> I don't get the fuss over gentoo, you can apt-get -b source anytime
[10:06] <topyli> heh
[10:06] <Scooter> can we install hoary from hoary live CD?
=== PD [~KID@203.109.86.7]  has left #ubuntu ["Leaving"]
[10:06] <Agrajag> farruinn: well, it's a bit more complex than that, you get the whole USE flags system
[10:07] <Agrajag> but I got so damn sick of waiting for compiles to finish
[10:07] <bur[n]er> Scooter: nope
[10:07] <topyli> Agrajag: it's better than using compiler options on debian?
[10:07] <Agrajag> and the thing about things running faster is complete BS in my opinion
[10:07] <Agrajag> topyli: it's not compiler options
[10:07] <farruinn> Agrajag: heh, I always wonder if the performance boost outweighs the wait time
[10:07] <farruinn> apparently not
[10:07] <topyli> Agrajag: oh. so what is it then?
[10:07] <Agrajag> it's deciding, per package or for the entire system, whether you want, for example, PNG support
[10:08] <Agrajag> farruinn: there is no performance boost
=== granted [~bibi@ca-bordeaux-8-195.w80-8.abo.wanadoo.fr]  has joined #ubuntu
[10:08] <Agrajag> almost every program is bounded by I/O, not CPU time
[10:08] <farruinn> true
[10:09] <Agrajag> so all these ridiculous compiler flags you see gentooers using just cause instabilities and make compiles take longer
=== vtg [vertigo@route6.alumina.nl]  has joined #ubuntu
[10:09] <Agrajag> but whatever
[10:09] <topyli> Agrajag: so you can decide what you like and always use the same "flags" for all packages where they apply?
[10:09] <farruinn> if it makes them happy =)
[10:09] <Agrajag> yes
=== steff [~steff@pD9FFB210.dip.t-dialin.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[10:09] <Agrajag> Or you can choose them per-package, like if you want one media player to have MKV support but not another
[10:10] <Agrajag> it's actually pretty nice, but it's not worth it as far as I'm concerned
[10:10] <topyli> Agrajag: hmm. might be useful, but gentoo still seems a bit too laborious for me :)
[10:10] <bur[n]er> that's a lot of admin work :\
[10:11] <Agrajag> admin work? hah, god help you if you're running gentoo on something other than a desktop
[10:11] <bur[n]er> if ubuntu could just optimize it's boot sequence... it would feel just as fast as gentoo
[10:12] <bur[n]er> supposedly it's been done for hoary
=== bur[n] er wonders if he'll have to install from cd, or if apt will do initscript stuff
[10:12] <Agrajag> yeah I've heard that, we'll see in a couple months
[10:12] <Agrajag> it will
[10:12] <Agrajag> you could switch to hoary right now if you felt adventurous

[10:16] <bur[n]er> can anyone recommend a text editor with tag highlighting that is curses based?
[10:17] <Agrajag> vim?
[10:17] <Agrajag> is that curses?
[10:17] <bur[n]er> emacs seems a bit overkill
[10:17] <bur[n]er> uhh
[10:17] <bur[n]er> maybe
[10:17] <Agrajag> nano might do it if you're lazy
[10:17] <Agrajag> just make sure you alias nano to nano -w
=== vtg [vertigo@route6.alumina.nl]  has joined #ubuntu
[10:17] <Agrajag> otherwise it'll destroy long lines in files
[10:17] <farruinn> vim is ncurses
[10:18] <bur[n]er> nano works for me fine, but i was just hoping for something to edit php on my server
[10:18] <bur[n]er> rather than ftp, change it, ftp it back
[10:18] <bur[n]er> vim looks good to me
[10:18] <farruinn> vim is awesome
[10:18] <bur[n]er> now i gotta learn vi commands better :\
[10:18] <topyli> does nano have syntax highllighting? methinks it doesn't
[10:18] <Agrajag> you really should learn vim, it's pretty much the standard text editor on any unix-like system
[10:18] <Agrajag> well, vim or vi
[10:18] <bur[n]er> nano has no syntax highlighting :\
[10:18] <Agrajag> oh it doesn't?
[10:18] <bur[n]er> nope
[10:19] <Agrajag> never mind then, I never use it so I don't know

[10:57] <tsw> why would someone even think about using anything else than a debian deritive
[10:57] <scizzo> [PervertedMonk] : why not just try it and find out if you like it or not?
[10:57] <Agrajag> well, it installs gnome by default, but you can get pretty much everything from the universe and multiverse repositories
[10:57] <[PervertedMonk]> yes scizzo
[10:57] <[PervertedMonk]> i want to hey
[10:57] <[PervertedMonk]> how can i get a copy
[10:57] <[PervertedMonk]> jst download it i suppose?
[10:57] <scizzo> [PervertedMonk] : www.ubuntulinux.org
[10:57] <tsw> yep
[10:57] <Agrajag> [PervertedMonk] : either download it from ubuntulinux.org or see if you can get a CD shipped from there
[10:57] <Tomcat_> Can anybody tell me what's up with the torrent of hoary live?
[10:57] <topyli> [PervertedMonk] : basically, ubuntu gives you a nice gnome workstation, and you can get the rest of the world's free software over the net
[10:57] <Agrajag> I don't know if they're still shipping them out though
