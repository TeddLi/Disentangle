[09:09] <gaelfx> what can I do to fix choppy playback using vdpau in smplayer?
[09:09] <gmachine_24> okie
[09:09] <coz_> gaelfx,   are all codecs installed?  and also try vlc to see if you get the same results
[09:09] <MACscr> gmachine_24: you never said you wanted to install the sdk
[09:10] <gaelfx> coz_: yeah, the codecs are installed, vlc runs it fine, but vlc doesn't use vdpau
[09:10] <coz_> gaelfx,  mm hold on let me check on t hat
[09:11] <gmachine_24> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[09:11] <MACscr> i cant stand morons
[09:11] <joeoshawa> i am playing wmv files using video player but i have to close and restart it after each video any idea why?
[09:11] <gaelfx> coz_: thanks
[09:11] <joeoshawa> if i double click a second video i just get a black screen
[09:13] <joeoshawa> it just started today
[09:13] <coz_> gaelfx,  apparenlty on this forum there are links to vlc  git  with vdpau patches   http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=53928&start=30
[09:14] <coz_> gaelfx,  also make sure the system is completely updated   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:14] <p896gbm> hi folks. i have a RAID question. i have an external 1TB usb harddrive which had been flaking out for a few weeks and stopped responding entirely, so i disassembled it and found two regular 512MB drives. i took them out and added them to my computer and both seem to work fine; no smart failures or anything. one of them contains the start of the filesystem; fsck says the filesystem size is twice the drive size. the other has no superblock.
[09:14] <p896gbm> since this appears to be a simple raid array, my question is how do i assemble it so i can rescue the data?
[09:15] <gaelfx> coz_: yes, the system is totally updated, but you don't understand, I didn't have this problem in 10.04 and I really would prefer not to use git just to get vlc working
[09:15] <ikonia> p896gbm: what technology is controlling the raid array
[09:15] <bullgard> [LAN] '~$ arp' shows on computer T43 "Address=noname", "HWaddress=00:0a:e4:...". But that computer shows '~$ hostname; MD97600'. How to accomplish that on computer T43 '~$ arp' will show  "Address=MD97600", "HWaddress=00:0a:e4:..."?
[09:16] <ikonia> bullgard: that is a networking question
[09:16] <joeoshawa> strange it stoped doing it
[09:16] <coz_> gaelfx,  mm  then I am not sure where to go from here... hold on let me check one more thing
[09:16] <joeoshawa> thanks anyway
[09:16] <MACscr> anyone know what "sink-inputs" means in pacmd? They mention the term sink many times
[09:16] <joeoshawa> odd i didn't do anything
[09:17] <gaelfx> coz_: thanks again
[09:17] <p896gbm> ikonia: no clue. it's just a very small circuit board that connected both drives. it has two sata ports, two hdd power connectors, a connector for a power adapter and a usb port, that's it
[09:17] <ikonia> p896gbm: is it mdadm based on a hardware raid solution ?
[09:17] <coz_> gaelfx,  no I couldnt find any other channel that could help with t his...although stay here and ask again ... others may have a solution that I do not...also you could ask in ##linux  ,,, its possible someone there may also have a solution
[09:18] <p896gbm> ikonia: i have no clue. i tried assembling it with mdadm but i don't really know what i'm doing. i'm hoping it's just a raid-0 array but i don't know
[09:18] <ikonia> p896gbm: before touching it with mdadm you need to know the technology that the device was put together with
[09:18] <greenIT> hi, does any1 know how to install javaME on ubuntu?
[09:18] <p896gbm> ikonia: i assume the circuit board implemented a hardware raid array; the usb drive showed up as a single partition whenever you plugged it into a computer, no drivers needed
[09:19] <ikonia> p896gbm: if it's hardware array, then you'll need the hardware array to build it
[09:19] <p896gbm> ikonia: ok. is there a way i can find that out? i thought i would first try assembling it as raid-0. it seems the most logical thing the hardware would do
[09:19] <p896gbm> ikonia: why? isn't raid-0 a standard way of assembling drives? i should be able to emulate that with a software like mdadm, no?
[09:19] <ikonia> p896gbm: using mdadm to assemble it if it's a hardware controlled array will help
[09:19] <p896gbm> k
[09:19] <beliveyourdream> is there a software for vector graphics with a command line like autocad ?
[09:19] <ikonia> p896gbm: sorry, typed that terrible
[09:19] <p896gbm> do you know the commands to mdadm to assemble it? they have different uuids
[09:20] <ikonia> p896gbm: assembling a hardware array with mdadm will never happen
[09:20] <p896gbm> ok
[09:20] <p896gbm> why?
[09:20] <greenIT> how can i install javaME on ubuntu?
[09:20] <ikonia> p896gbm: because they are two different technologies that relay on their own software controlled methods that are different
=== cftygv is now known as ededdy
[09:21] <p896gbm> so? there's gotta be a way i can reassemble the filesystem on here. if i can figure out how it's striped, i could in theory create a 1gb file, copy all the chunks in, and then loopmount the file
[09:21] <p896gbm> i mean the data is all there, it's mountable *somehow*
[09:21] <ikonia> p896gbm: why does there have to be a way ?
[09:21] <p896gbm> i'm not sure why i need the hardware. the hardware is dead
[09:21] <p896gbm> ikonia: there has to be a way because the drives are fine, it's the controller that died
[09:21] <ikonia> p896gbm: you need the hardware as it knows and understands (and builds and presents) the finished array
[09:22] <p896gbm> k
[09:22] <ikonia> p896gbm: yes, but the controller is what makes the raid array, if that is dead a different raid technology doesn't understand how it's built
[09:22] <p896gbm> ikonia: yes i know that, that's why i figured i would start by assuming it's raid-0
[09:22] <p896gbm> isn't raid-0 a standard? different controllers would mount it the same way, no?
[09:22] <ikonia> p896gbm: assuming it's raid-0 is pointless if you don't know how it's built
[09:23] <p896gbm> k
[09:23] <ikonia> p896gbm: raid 0 is a "standard" not an implimentation, different methods/controllers build and present it in different ways
[09:23] <p896gbm> k
[09:24] <greenIT> i need javaME on my ubuntu machine... how can i install it?
=== red_ is now known as red
[09:24] <p896gbm> can't i start by just guessing a few common ways it would assemble it? there's gotta be a few 'most common' ways the data is striped across the drives
[09:24] <ikonia> greenIT: download it from Oracle and install it
[09:24] <p896gbm> if i can force mdadm to mount it with different striping parameters i can test each one to see if it's a valid filesystem
[09:24] <ikonia> p896gbm: no, you're not listening
[09:25] <greenIT> ikonia: isn't there only a version for windows?
[09:25] <ikonia> p896gbm: the raid array is built with a software chip on that hardware controller, other software components don't know how that software works
[09:25] <ikonia> greenIT: contact Oracle and ask for support
[09:25] <greenIT> ikonia: ok, thx
[09:25] <Talicom> greenIT: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=137149
[09:25] <p896gbm> yeah i know ikonia, but i can *guess* how it works
[09:25] <p896gbm> that's what i'm trying to do
[09:25] <ikonia> p896gbm: no "you" can't
[09:25] <ikonia> p896gbm: the software can't
[09:26] <greenIT> yay, thx Talicom :)
[09:26] <p896gbm> i don't want the software to guess, *I* want to guess. i want to tell it different ways to stripe the data and test whether it's a valid filesystem
=== tobias is now known as Guest92453
[09:26] <ikonia> p896gbm: mdadm has no idea how LSI presents array, so asking mdadm to build an LSI controlled array is like asking a someone who doesn't speak English to write shakespear
[09:26] <cast> MACscr: actually, you can
[09:27] <ikonia> p896gbm: it's not telling it how to stripe, guessing it's raid-0 is fine, but the layout of the disks and how it's assembled and intergrity depends on the device that built it
[09:27] <p896gbm> k
[09:27] <ikonia> p896gbm: you need the same tool that built it to re-assemble it
[09:27] <MACscr> cast: prove it? ive never seen such a thing without an emulator or virtualization
[09:27] <MACscr> or a "container"
[09:27] <cast> chroot
[09:28] <MACscr> but that would mean they would have to share the same kernel, correct?
[09:28] <cast> yip, sure
[09:28] <cast> what kernel does android use again?
[09:29] <cast> one wouldn't use chroot, but....i think you're getting my point
[09:29] <p896gbm> ikonia: i'm not convinced of that. i'm sure it's simple, because it looks simple. i can even mount the first drive alone, and see the directory structure. this is a simple ext2 filesystem
[09:29] <cast> for what its worth, linux can run under linux as a process, aka UML
[09:29] <[deXter]> cast: depends on the android version. for instance mine is running 2.6.37.1
[09:29] <p896gbm> ikonia: if i fsck the first drive, it recognizes the ext2 filesystem and can even repair it. it says the filesystem is twice the size of the drive
[09:29] <ikonia> p896gbm: if you can mount the first drive, it probably isn't a raid disk
[09:30] <cast> [deXter]: right, so it uses linux :P
[09:30] <ikonia> p896gbm: if it was a raid device you wouldn't be able to mount the first disk unless it was raid 1 possibly
[09:30] <wonderwal-> hi which kernel does 10.10 server come with?
[09:30] <wonderwal-> !kernels
[09:30] <cast> with linux its pretty trivial to seperate OS instances with the likes of vserver and openvz,
[09:30] <MACscr> cast: yeah, i see your point. Im not a big fan of chroot setups
[09:31] <llutz_> wonderwal-: 2.6.35-22
[09:31] <p896gbm> ikonia: ok. so it's probably not raid then. it's something simpler. do you think the controller just put the two drives back to back? maybe i should just cat the two devices together into a file and try loopmounting it
[09:31] <cast> though...back to the original question, i was more thinking it would be feasible to install android on a piece of similar hardware, such as an ARM laptop
[09:32] <wonderwal-> llutz_: whats the -22 for? theyre on 2.6.35.11
[09:32] <ikonia> p896gbm: no, I don't think the second drive was but back to back as that would be raid 1 and I don't think there is any raid on it
[09:32] <cast> ikonia: that would not be raid 1
[09:32] <p896gbm> ikonia: well raid-1 would replicate the data, no? there's no replication here
[09:32] <ikonia> sorry raid 0
[09:32] <ikonia> typo, had raid 1 on the brain
[09:32] <cast> ikonia: that would not be raid 0, either, unless you set the strip size to the size of the disks
[09:32] <p896gbm> i thought raid-0 striped it for better speed
[09:33] <ikonia> cast: I agree it would not be raid 0, which is what I said
[09:33] <p896gbm> cast: do you know if i can tell mdadm, or some other tool, to mount it as a raid array with the strip size == the size of the disks?
[09:33] <ikonia> p896gbm: yes, but to make two disks presented as one file system would have to be done through some sort of raid or lvm
[09:33] <cast> p896gbm: rather than catting the two devices together you could suggest using a dmsetup to create a virtual device that was the concat of the two drives
[09:33] <MACscr> grrr, this audio thing is driving me crazy. Why the heck is ubuntu not switching my sound output back to the correct device. its showing that it switched, yet all apps still use hdmi
[09:33] <ikonia> p896gbm: 1.) there is no raid used on your disks 2.) you cannot tell mdadm to build arrays out of other raid technology disks/arrays
[09:33] <p896gbm> ikonia: is there a linux tool to do that in software? or should i try telling my motherboard it's a raid array and booting from a livecd?
[09:34] <ikonia> p896gbm: its NOT a raid array
[09:34] <MACscr> here is some of my pacmd output: http://pastebin.com/9pxHujxf. Any help is sincerely appreciated
[09:34] <p896gbm> cast: that would be great. so dmsetup will let me do that?
[09:34] <p896gbm> cast: k i will try that
[09:34] <wonderwal-> what is kernel 2.6.35-22 ?  is that 2.6.35.0 with patches or something?
[09:34] <cast> ikonia: actually, you can, mdadm surprising supports non-mdadm native arrays...it won't support all the various HW and fake and soft raid formats, but i believe it supports a few
[09:35] <ikonia> cast: it never works
[09:35] <wonderwal-> :'(
[09:35] <ikonia> cast: the main ones, LSI/3com/HPciss it never works due to the private region data not being accessible
[09:35] <ikonia> or in an understan
[09:35] <ikonia> oops
[09:36] <cast> that private region is enforced by the raid controller :P if you have the raid controller, you'd use that for raid...
[09:36] <ikonia> cast: totally agree
[09:37] <cast> it is annoying how some raid cards don't obviously have a way to just act as a normal sata/sas controller
[09:38] <cast> p896gbm: dmsetup will, using linear mappings. the devicemapper is how cryptsetup/mdadm/lvm implement their functionality
[09:38] <ikonia> p896gbm: why do you think the 2 disks where used together
[09:38] <ikonia> p896gbm: what makes you believe that the 2 disks are somehow linked ?
[09:38] <ali___> hi

[09:50] <oopepe> Hi, where is a good place to store my custom iptables script in ubuntu so that it gets loaded on server reboot? Im running ubuntu server 10.04. I dont want to use ufw.
[09:50] <p896gbm> cast: cool. the filesystem size (indicated when i fsck it) seems to imply that the number of sectors used is slightly less than the number on the drive. blockdev gives me 976773105, but if i work out half the filesystem size it's 976768032. i'll try it both ways
[09:50] <MACscr> hmm, could my pulseaudio be failing and alsa is being used instead? Seems none of my pulseaudio options are working
[09:51] <MACscr> i cant even use the master volume controls (aka, they dont apply)
[09:51] <Gnea> oopepe: I just save it somewhere like this:  iptables-save > /etc/network/firewall  then call it at boottime in /etc/network/interfaces like this:  post=up iptables-restore < /etc/network/firewall
[09:51] <Gnea> oopepe: er, post-up
[09:51] <YankDownUnder> oopepe, You can use /etc/rc.local => put the contents of the script there, or call it from that script.
[09:51] <oopepe> Gnea: Ok, thank you
[09:51] <oopepe> Thank you
[09:51] <Gnea> MACscr: the loss of pulseaudio can never be a bad thing

[09:52] <iDope> hi guys, I just installed Ubuntu 10.10 and I want to connect to a Wireless network using 802.1X Authentication with WEP (Dynamic WEP). I only see WEP WPA Passhprase WPA2 personal in Wireless Authentication options when I try to set the security parameters in Network Manager.

[09:52] <MACscr> plus i dont like that none of my management software work
[09:52] <MACscr> aka, sound contorls
[09:53] <MACscr> controls
[09:53] <MACscr> how do i know which is being used?
[09:53] <Gnea> MACscr: alsa is the driver that makes the sound hardware work - pulseaudio is nothing more than an application layer that attempts to form a mold around it. alsa has historically been better, is better, and will always be better than using a sound daemon. pulse works good for some hardware situations, though.
[09:54] <Talicom> I am dual booting with windows 7. how would i be able to mount the partition that my windows files are in on startup?

[09:54] <Gnea> MACscr: you can easily control alsa (And have more fine-tuned control) by using alsamixer
[09:54] <MACscr> Gnea: everything worked fine until a yesterday when i changed the default output to my hdmi temporarily
[09:54] <Talicom> thanks
[09:54] <llutz_> oopepe: use iptables-save / -restore and place it in /etc/network/if-up.d  if-down.d

[09:56] <MACscr> Gnea: well i have changed it back and it shows correctly and when i run tests within the ubuntu sound utility, it works correctly, but even after rebooting, every app uses my hdmi
[09:56] <bullgard> Is there a Ubuntu command to print the known hosts in the LAN?

[09:58] <MACscr> Gnea: been using totem for testing. But even on boot, the ubuntu startup music is using hdmi
[09:59] <fredrik_> When I log in to my ubuntu there is something wrong with compiz and/or window manager. My awn dock is messed up and windows misses the frame. My solusion is to load "compiz fusion icon" and threw that "reload window manager". How can I resolve this?

[10:00] <Gnea> MACscr: okay, would you please separately pastebin the output of the files contained in /etc/pulse/ ?
[10:00] <YankDownUnder> fredrik_, You can add the "fusion-icon" to your startup programs (SYSTEM => PREFERENCES => START UP APPLICATIONS)

[10:03] <Gnea> MACscr: I meant the contents of each file, please
[10:03] <MACscr> Gnea: the files havent changed as you can see since last year. So obviously its not a change within those files
[10:03] <MACscr> that caused the problem
[10:04] <fredrik_> YankDownUnder, Yes, I have done that now. But still. I have to do a reload everytime I start my computor. Why doesn't  compiz load correctly? Or most important. How can I make this happend automaticaly?
[10:04] <Gnea> MACscr: what about in ~/.pulse/ ?
[10:05] <YankDownUnder> fredrik_, Make sure you have the settings correct for "fusion-icon" - as well, you could always use gconf-editor to change the window manager as well.
[10:05] <terrid> hi all

[10:10] <fredrik_> YankDownUnder, I just checked the "default window manager" with gconf-editor. It is set to "compiz" (exaclty like the attribute "current". Still.. everytime I log in to ubuntu the window manager doesn't load correctly
[10:10] <YankDownUnder> fredrik_, As well, did you setup "fusion-icon" to load in your startup-applications?
[10:11] <fredrik_> nope. Do I have to do that? Thought that this was just a "launchbar" for some compiz-applicaitons
[10:12] <YankDownUnder> fredrik_, Give it a go - and test it - lemme know how it goes mate. (Missus just got home)
[10:12] <fredrik_> ok.. I'll do that!

[10:16] <rockman125> if i want to chroot on my file system i just need to do like this chroot and the folder where my / is mounted?
[10:17] <Israfel-Laptop> UBuntu seems to have the british spell checker enabled by default. How do I fix that?
[10:17] <erUSUL> rockman125: from a livecd? i would bind mount /dev/, /sys/ and /proc/ before chrooting
[10:18] <erUSUL> rockman125: i.e <unconvertable> sudo mount --bind /dev/ /mount/point/dev/ <unconvertable> and the ssame for the other two
=== Dementio is now known as Dem|away
[10:18] <rockman125> ah and then chroot?
[10:19] <rockman125> after mounting the other two also what would be the command to chroot
[10:20] <erUSUL> rockman125: the command is <unconvertable> sudo chroot /mount/point/ <unconvertable>
[10:20] <p896gbm> cast: ok, so i figured out how to properly mount this thing. however the second device seems to be reporting its size as 160gb rather than 500gb. turns out maybe this drive is bad after all.
[10:20] <Gnea> MACscr: oh, okay lol
[10:20] <rockman125> good i will do it ty erUSUL
[10:20] <rockman125> what does this error means >> Error unpacking rpm package net-tools-1.60-81.el5.x86_64

[10:20] <MACscr> Gnea: yeah, i gave up as i had been working on the issue for 45 mins and just said screw it, lets try this =P

[10:24] <fredrik_> YankDownUnder, Nope. It did not help. Compiz-fusion Icon starts but I still have to right-click on it and choose "reload window manager"
[10:25] <satya> in my /etc/passwd file, users have the shell /bin/sh. i created the users with useradd
[10:25] <ylmfos> what labs dos it need in osd lyrics?
[10:26] <satya> if i su username, pwd= /

[10:30] <jd> hi
[10:31] <blagorod> hows you?
[10:31] <TheSarge> how can I change the port the built in RDP server uses?
[10:32] <bullgard> Gnea: What do you mean by "ping the broadcast"?
[10:33] <Gnea> bullgard: get your broadcast address from ifconfig, then: sudo ping -b broadcast-ip
[10:33] <p896gbm> cast: do you know why fdisk might show the wrong size? my bios says the correct size, 500gb, and does not signal any SMART failure. fdisk seems to think it's 160 GB
[10:33] <Gnea> bullgard: then look at the arp table: arp -a
[10:33] <p896gbm> cast: and when i try to mount with dmsetup it says the device is not big enough
[10:33] <cast> p896gbm: what does blockdev think?
[10:34] <Gnea> bullgard: nmap could work too, you might have false positives using both so they are good together
[10:34] <cast> p896gbm: or the line in dmesg for that matter
[10:34] <_Rix> guys i have a question
[10:34] <_Rix> will it blend
[10:35] <Phlosten> _Rix: always
[10:35] <p896gbm> blockdev says 160041885696 == 160 gb exactly (not 166, slightly less than a third), and dmesg says the same, 160gb
[10:35] <FrEaKmAn_> hi.. I have windows7 and ubuntu with dual boot.. today I started my PC and grub boot menu wont show up..
[10:35] <p896gbm> very strange
[10:35] <FrEaKmAn_> before that menu there is a new message but I cant read it because it disappers really fast
[10:36] <FrEaKmAn_> any ideas how I could read it
[10:36] <erUSUL> FrEaKmAn_: what is showing up instead?
[10:36] <FrEaKmAn_> erUSUL, nothing...
[10:36] <FrEaKmAn_> just that underscore blinks...
[10:36] <TheSarge> Can anyone tell me how I can change the port the built in RDP server uses please?
[10:36] <erUSUL> FrEaKmAn_: so a black screen? you boot directly into ubuntu? into windows? the machine explodes?
[10:36] <p896gbm> cast: so both blockdev and dmesg say 160gb. what do you think? is the device just busted?
[10:37] <FrEaKmAn_> erUSUL, no. I dont boot into anything.. because grub menu doesnt show up
[10:37] <cast> p896gbm: its an interesting way for a device to break wouldn't you say
[10:37] <erUSUL> FrEaKmAn_: i would boot into a livecd to check that the disk is ok; mount partitions and see if everything is still there and finally reinstall grub
[10:37] <erUSUL> !grub2 | FrEaKmAn_

[10:41] <theos>  hi :) is there a way to use m4b files in ubuntu?
[10:41] <p896gbm> cast: ok i got it. it remapped it to sdb, not sde, which is why my fstab was all fucked when i booted with these drives in it. smartctl says it's fine, blockdev says it's 500gb, fdisk says there's no partition table (which is correct). this is promising

[10:43] <b0tz> Hi, I accidently cleared my package cache using ubuntu tweak, I forgot I was supposed to make a APTonCD backup before I did that. when i reload the package cache in aptoncd it doesnt find anything. Can I make a cache again of all apt-installed packages for aptoncd?

[10:43] <TheSarge> or how to change it?

[10:43] <erUSUL> FrEaKmAn_: check it with gparted 8 or directly with e2fsck in command line )
[10:44] <cast> b0tz: i don't know what aptoncd is, but unlikely, the debs don't exist on your system now that the cache is cleared
[10:44] <b0tz> anyone have any ideas?
[10:44] <b0tz> Yeah thats what i figured
[10:44] <mah454> who i can send file.gz with mail command ?
[10:44] <b0tz> But I mean theres still installed versions
[10:44] <cast> b0tz: there is no way to work backwards and create them from an installed set of packages
[10:44] <b0tz> so i was hoping i could just remake the cache
[10:44] <b0tz> Grrrr...
[10:44] <TheSarge> wow big help here..
[10:44] <b0tz> AptonCD lets you 'burn' a iso of your currently cached apt installed stuff so you can do an easy restore of them
[10:45] <b0tz> This sucks..
[10:45] <erUSUL> TheSarge: try another rdp client?

[10:46] <TheSarge> erUSUL: why? I want to use the built in one, surely there is some config file to change the port?
[10:46] <b0tz> how would I do that
[10:46] <b0tz> aptoncd makes it easy  anyways
[10:46] <b0tz> Im screwed now that I cant remake my cache though. ffs..
[10:47] <cast> you'd just burn /var/cache/apt/archives/ to cd/dvd

[10:51] <b0tz> cash: is there a wya to take install out of the whole list without going down each line? im not too good with awk..

[11:07] <blagorod> llutz:_ Ive working this
[11:07] <blagorod> llutz_: Ive working this modem when I load from live CD
[11:07] <flor> Gnea, its a wlan device that connects with dsl for internet access. it's got an additional function, printing via wlan: I plug the printer into the wlan-modem. and should be able to print, but i'm Not ;-)
[11:08] <blagorod> llutz_: can I copy that driver to my OS?
[11:08] <Gnea> flor: okay, well just to be clear here, it's just a dsl modem that allows computers to connect wirelessly to it?
[11:09] <flor> Gnea, yep, exactly.
[11:09] <tittn> anybody know good tool to connect to my plesk vpn from ubuntu im having problems setting it up with the tools available in software manager
[11:09] <Gnea> flor: ah okay, so if you plugged the printer in and if it has an IP, you should be able to set it up using the printing configuration tool
[11:09] <Gnea> !printer | flor
[11:09] <ubottu> flor: Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[11:09] <alp82> i am searching a good uml editor
[11:10] <Gnea> flor: just make sure you tell it that you're looking for a network printer
[11:10] <alp82> doesnt matter if online or desktop or eclipse/netbeans plugin
[11:10] <alp82> it just has to have a nice user interface
[11:11] <bullgard> llutz_: I have cursorily read 'man nmap'. But I still do not know what to substitute for <network> in my case.

[11:16] <Jonii> Wubi installer left my windows booting thing with this annoying "select if you want to use ubuntu or windows", where ubuntu-choice doesn't work, and windows ubuntu uninstaller doesn't work. How do I destroy that manually?
[11:16] <Jean1> hi, I keep getting 'access denied' if i want to delete something in /var/www, I guess I have to use chown, but with what parameters ? Thanks
[11:17] <Erdj> ubuntu spanish
[11:17] <Erdj> <unconvertable> ?
[11:17] <Jonii> Wubi uninstaller says something like "py<something> not found"
[11:17] <bullgard> Back4More420: Please specify your operating system and your wireless card so that people can help you.
[11:17] <Back4More420> I haxw ubumtu 10.4
[11:18] <Back4More420> 64 bit
[11:18] <spidla> Jonii, you probably need to restore your Windows master boot record
[11:18] <flor> Gnea, i've done the following: (1) duplicated my existing printer in -> system -> printers. (2) changed settings: device-uri  -> change -> network-printer -> lpd/lpr-host (3) entered as host: socket://<IP-address> (4) sEARCH for printers/printer queues. it didn't work
[11:18] <Gnea> Back4More420: are you just trying to get wireless to work correctly in ubuntu?
[11:18] <Jonii> spidla, ok, how? Also, where did wubi-installer put its stuff?
[11:19] <MegaHerz> Hi all. How to create screencast on Ubuntu? Two apps which I found in Applications and then tried - failed to do anything. One creating gif's which I don't and another (Istanbul) - just hangs
[11:19] <spidla> Jonii, you can use Windows install CD to reach recovery console
[11:19] <shal3r> http://pastebin.com/mWuKXmzx - Any ideas how to fix that?
[11:19] <spidla> Jonii, there is an option to recover MBR
[11:19] <Gnea> flor: I see, what's the make/model of the printer?
[11:19] <Jonii> I don't have Windows install CD
[11:19] <flor> Gnea, it's a kyocera mita 1020 d
[11:19] <Back4More420> no I have it working in this version but want to get it working in the UE 2.8
[11:19] <Jean1> hi, I keep getting 'access denied' if i want to delete something in /var/www, I guess I have to use chown, but with what parameters ? Thanks
[11:20] <Gnea> Back4More420: what's UE?
[11:20] <Jonii> Also, with dual boot ubuntu thing, wouldn't MBR-recovery destroy my ability to boot into Ubuntu?
[11:20] <Back4More420> ultimate eddition 2.8
[11:20] <spidla> Jonii, which version of Windows do you have ?
[11:20] <Jonii> spidla, Vista
[11:21] <penalvch> Jean1: You could also try at the Terminal sudo rm (file)
[11:21] <dr0id> any difference between rm -f -r folder and rm -fr folder ?
[11:21] <Back4More420> if I can get the drivers from this OS I could then put them in the UE
[11:21] <Jean1> penalvch: I don't want to use sudo all the time
[11:22] <spidla> Jonii, I thought that you want to get back to Windows install only . Then the proble is probably in the GRUB loader configuration. Try to boot from Ubuntu live-cd and then you can access your Ubuntu partition and repair GRUB
[11:23] <Jonii> spidla, hmm... GRUB is this Ubuntu-related OS-choice-manager-thing?
[11:23] <Lint> dr0id, not for rm
[11:23] <spidla> Jonii, well I assume you are using GRUB as you boot-loader ... it is a deafult one in Ubuntu
[11:23] <dr0id> Lint: maybe some speed differencee ? :)
[11:23] <p896gbm> hey guys, if i use dmsetup to assemble a drive that has a partition table in it, how do i then mount one of the partitions?
[11:23] <Lint> dr0id, lol no
[11:24] <dr0id> ok
[11:24] <Jonii> If it is, it works just fine. It's just that when I choose to start windows from it, Windows, before launching, asks if I want to launch Windows Vista or Ubuntu(this Wubi-installation of Ubuntu doesn't work)
[11:24] <dr0id> Lint: I thought -fr would be faster than -f -r :)
[11:24] <Jonii> And I want to get rid of this Wubi-installation entirely
[11:25] <Gnea> Back4More420: I think you'll want to ask in #ultimateedition
[11:25] <spidla> Jonii, ouch I understand... this may be the result of chainloading process used while booting Windows from GRUB
[11:25] <Back4More420> Thank You @Gnea

[11:26] <Back4More420> this is the OS I want drivers from, where are they stored?
[11:26] <Gnea> flor: can you print if you connect the printer directly?
[11:27] <Gnea> Back4More420: they're not really 'stored' anywhere, it's part of the kernel usually, you'll need to identify your wifi card and which driver it's supposed to use and find a suitable package or driver in UE
[11:28] <takuan> anybody in here knows about fqdn and network-manager?
[11:29] <Back4More420> Gnea, Thanks
[11:29] <tittn> !openvpn
[11:29] <ubottu> OpenVPN is a vpn technology in Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install openvpn and then see http://openvpn.net/ and see the documentation "HOWTO" noting you have already installed it. ;-) It rocks!
[11:29] <spidla> Jonii, maybe PartitionMagic could help ?
[11:29] <Jean1> hi, I keep getting 'access denied' if i want to delete something in /var/www, I guess I have to use chown, but with what parameters ? I want to be able to delete from a filemanager or even from a samba share. Thanks
[11:30] <MegaHerz> What device should I use in an sound recording application if /dev/dsp doesn't work?
[11:30] <Gnea> Jean1: chown -R user.group dir/  will recursively change it
[11:30] <spidla> Jonii, or there might be some useful settings in your boot.ini in your Windows installation
[11:30] <Jonii> spidla, if you know any keywords I could try googling, it'd help. Like, what's the name of that boot loader that let's me choose between Windows and Wubi.
[11:31] <Gnea> Jonii: wubi just uses NTLDR
[11:31] <Jean1> Gnea: chown -R jean.group /var/ww/* ? and what is 'group' ?
[11:31] <Gnea> !wubi | Jonii
[11:31] <ubottu> Jonii: Wubi is an Ubuntu installer for Windows users that allows you to install and uninstall Ubuntu like a Windows application, in a simple and safe way. http://wubi-installer.org/support.php and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide for troubleshooting.

[11:32] <spidla> Jonii, well it seems that Wubi is really updating your boot.ini in Windows ! try to find those lines and edit them
[11:32] <cecilio> sorry

[11:34] <flor> Gnea, yes, that's working fine, printing directly.
[11:34] <pirx> hi! i have a situation where a software is making a lot of requests to an external API, and i would like to check for how long those sockets are open. it will take some time before i am able to add that to the loggaing of the application. any ideas? (e.g. how to check for how long sockets are open, to some certain IP, during say 1minute)
[11:34] <spidla> Jonii, there should be a list of available operating systems. There you can delete the Wubi lines and you can set your Vista installation as a default operating system. Second boot menu should disappear
[11:34] <Gnea> !tv | bibic682
[11:34] <ubottu> bibic682: http://www.linuxtv.org/ has extensive information about using TV cards under Linux. Available viewers for analog cards: Zapping, tvtime (GTK/GNOME), Kaffeine, kdetv (KDE), xawtv, motv. For digital cards: Me-TV (GNOME), Klear (KDE), dvb-utils. For both analog and digital cards, !MythTV is a powerful framework. Your card may work the !IVTV drivers. See also !TV-Out
[11:35] <bibic682> thanks all...will check it out
[11:36] <Gnea> flor: so what's preventing you from adding the new printer instead of copying the currently working printer?
[11:36] <spidla> Jonii, In your boot.init you should see something like this http://pastebin.com/3iFa8QmN
[11:36] <flor> Gnea, got it! i had to type in the ip address only without "socket://" in front of it. yeah!!! thanks for your support!!
[11:36] <Jean1> Gnea it worked, thanks, have a good day :)
[11:36] <Gnea> flor: oh, awesome :)
[11:36] <spidla> Jonii, the last line represents the modification made bu Wubi
[11:36] <Gnea> Jean1: cheers :)
[11:37] <Jonii> spidla, windows Vista doesn't have boot.ini, but yeah, it seems wubiguide has good tutorial to how to remove it
[11:37] <spidla> Jonii, well I am Linux user :-) in Windows XP there was boot.ini
[11:37] <goggle-eyed_bear> do u have windows iso disks?

[12:30] <bullgard> Gnea: Thank you for commenting.

[12:31] <helghareeb> ubuntu are experiementing 3D drivers in Unity ( 11.04) now. Hopefully it will be available soon
[12:31] <helghareeb> my advice as I told you: stick to the default now, and wait for the new release. Hopefully it will handle the issue
[12:32] <Gatekeeper-ZA> no the issue is i cant recive the sources list so synaptics cant let me add packages ets. it doesnt list

[12:42] <Satauros> without GUI?
[12:43] <jrib> Satauros: you can use postfix or exim.  If you really want to use sendmail, sure use that.  Each of these projects have their own irc channel for configuration questions
[12:43] <Satauros> ok, *searches for the sendmail irc channel :p*
[12:43] <Thalius> Satauros: It has a commandline gui, really easy to config
[12:44] <jrib> Satauros: out of curiousity, why do you want to use sendmail if you don't know how to configure it?

[12:44] <CASSANO> bla bla bla
[12:44] <Satauros> due to lack of other options, jrib
[12:44] <jrib> Satauros: but we just gave you two other options
[12:45] <Satauros> my boss told me to set the mail relay on the ubuntu server
[12:45] <Satauros> so first option i noticed, sendmail
[12:45] <jrib> Satauros: I've always used exim, mostly because sendmail is notorious for being difficult to configure :/
[12:45] <Satauros> first come, first serve
[12:45] <bfri> any one help me find where my temp files are when i open a youtube page?
[12:45] <Satauros> ok, exim it is
[12:45] <Satauros> you've convinced me
[12:45] <Satauros> ^^
[12:46] <Satauros> i suppose a simple sudo apt-get install exim will do the trick?
[12:46] <Thalius> Satauros: yes
[12:46] <jrib> Satauros: might be exim4, check the link
[12:46] <Satauros> i'll try right away
[12:47] <Thalius> Satauros: exim4 indeed. After that use sudo exim4-config, youll get this: http://library.linode.com/web-applications/project-management/redmine/images/redmine-debian-5-exim-config-1.png
[12:47] <Satauros> ok installed  - i'm so happy it automatically uninstalled sendmail :D -
[12:48] <bfri> any one help me find where my temp files are when i open a youtube page?
[12:49] <Satauros> don't you mean sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config Thalius?
[12:49] <jrib> bfri: /home/jrib/.mozilla/firefox/p26rxi5a.default/Cache ?
[12:49] <jrib> bfri: or whatever your *.default directory is.
[12:50] <Satauros> so that worked Thalius, now, in order to make this work (using our primary and secondairy mail relay), which option should i choose best?
[12:50] <Satauros> (yes i have entered n00b mode)
[12:51] <Thalius> Satauros: Dont know tbh. Been some while since i configged it, and i only use 1 relay
[12:51] <bfri> jrib: i dont have that location you mentioned and i just up graded to 10.04 and my default directory no longer has them
[12:52] <doodie> how do I join 2 empty partitions using gparted?
[12:52] <jrib> bfri: you don't have ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/Cache?
[12:52] <Thalius> Satauros: I picked the internetsite option, since that matched my needs/requirements
[12:53] <Satauros> Thalius, i suppose i should be choosing 'mail send by smarthost, no local mail'?
[12:53] <Satauros> in my case
[12:53] <Thalius> Satauros: would make sense since you dont want to host a mailserver on the same host, and only want to send out forgot-my-passwords mail
=== peregrinator_six is now known as dial_up_br
[12:54] <Thalius> Satauros: You can always check if the relay works by sending a mail from commandline.
[12:55] <bfri> any one help me find where my temp files are when i open a youtube page?
[12:55] <jrib> bfri: can you answer my question?
[12:57] <bfri> jrib: no i dont have that directory
[12:57] <jrib> bfri: type "about:cache" in your firefox and see what the directory for Disk cache device is
[12:58] <Satauros> ok, thx Thalius, in case of any problems i'll notify (today or tomorrow, probably tomorrow :p)

[12:58] <Satauros> next question, to set my primary and secondary DNS, i suppose i only have to edit the /etc/resolv.conf file?
[12:58] <bfri> jrib: ok there it is i was trying to just go to that directory manually
[12:59] <Thalius> Satauros: Yup. considering you dont have a daemon generating the config file
[12:59] <Satauros> yes I read that the dhcp3 client reconfigures that resolv.conf file
[13:00] <Satauros> but i'll be using a static IP, so probably will remove the dhcp client, if possible
[13:00] <bfri> Jrib: if i just start in the "/" directory and follow the path i get stopped at ".mozilla" why is that
[13:00] <rams_pandu> how can I install a dictionary in ubuntu?
[13:00] <doodie> how do I join 2 empty partitions using gparted? Copy and PAste?
[13:00] <Thalius> Satauros: No need to remove it, just set the /etc/network/interfaces to static and it wont be used
[13:01] <Satauros> noted
[13:01] <jrib> bfri: show me what you are doing in pastebin, I do not understand what you said

[13:12] <BartHH> I need to have 1 app running on my second screen without all the panels around it
[13:12] <pilas> hello ubuntu world... been on linux since monday... the world is a happier place
[13:12] <pilas> need help with linux partitions... simple questions... pleas pm
[13:13] <Neosano> pilas, just ask here
[13:13] <pilas> ok...
[13:13] <AbhijiT> pilas, ask here only. with all details on one line
[13:13] <BartHH> Bohemian_Cow: do you know if it is even possible?
[13:13] <Neosano> BartHH, it's linux, everything is possible
[13:14] <MaslowK> Except being windows.
[13:14] <MaslowK> lol.
[13:14] <pilas> Ok, so I am doing my first hard disk install on a 500GB ATA with one NTFS partition with my windows on. Ubuntu needs its own linux partition: Can I trust linux to do the partition without fucking up windows?
[13:14] <BartHH> I mean possible without creating ubuntu from scratch
[13:14] <Bohemian_Cow> Well you could just manually set the length of the panel in question?
[13:15] <Bohemian_Cow> Ie not having it "Expand"
[13:15] <pilas> panel?
[13:15] <BartHH> the panels are duplicates of the ones running on my main screen
[13:15] <BartHH> If I change the settings, they change both
[13:15] <Neosano> pilas, oh wait, you have to resize ntfs partition first
[13:15] <BartHH> or mmm
[13:15] <BartHH> maybe not
[13:16] <BartHH> where are all those panel settings saved?
[13:16] <Neosano> pilas, you can do it from GParted, I've done it several times successfully, but I'll recommend you to save data first
[13:16] <pilas> tks neosano... im in the middle of saving it up
[13:16] <Bohemian_Cow> Do you have Gnome-Configuration editor installed?
=== sapphirecat is now known as sapphirepaw
[13:17] <Bohemian_Cow> aka gconf
[13:17] <BartHH> ah yes found it in /apps/panel
[13:17] <shane4ubuntu> I linked ddclient into /etc/init.d/  is there an easy way to make sure it is running?  I ran sudo service --status-all and ddclient shows up as:  -  ddclient  does that mean it isn't running?
[13:18] <Neosano> pilas, so you have to run live cd, try ubuntu without installing, run GParted to resize ntfs partition.
[13:18] <rams_pandu> can I access windows vista desktop from ubuntu10.04?
[13:18] <MaslowK> rams_pandu: Sure can.
[13:18] <Neosano> rams_pandu, desktop?
[13:18] <MaslowK> Well
[13:18] <Neosano> you mean desktop folder?
[13:19] <rams_pandu> MaslowK, can you tell me how?
[13:19] <MaslowK> Depends on what you mean by that
[13:19] <jrib> shane4ubuntu: what do you mean, you linked it?  When you install ddclient it should automatically be there
[13:19] <MaslowK> If you mean having both installed and being able to switch between them, you can do that.
[13:19] <AbhijiT> rams_pandu, use teamviewer
[13:19] <shane4ubuntu> jrib hmm, mine wasn't at least I don't think it was, yes, I linked it.
[13:19] <rams_pandu> Neosano, I mean i have many apps on windows, I want to access all of then from ubuntu. like start button, programs etc
[13:19] <jrib> shane4ubuntu: how did you install it?  Surely, you used apt?
[13:19] <shane4ubuntu> jrib: if it was in there it is possible that I linked over top of it, but I'm about 90% sure it wasn't running
[13:19] <MaslowK> Oh, well.
[13:20] <Neosano> that's a different thing..
[13:20] <shane4ubuntu> jrib yep apt
[13:20] <MaslowK> Not really rams_pandu
[13:20] <AbhijiT> rams_pandu, is this vista and ubuntu installed on the same hard disk?
[13:20] <jrib> shane4ubuntu: ddclient package includes /etc/init.d/ddclient
[13:20] <Neosano> rams_pandu, mostly no. though you can install windows on a virtual machine and use windows from linux.
[13:20] <shane4ubuntu> jrib, it didn't seem to be running though, is there a way to check if it is running/configured correctly?
[13:20] <rams_pandu> AbhijiT, yeah, both are installed on the same harddisk
[13:21] <jrib> shane4ubuntu: furthermore, what exactly did you link?  /etc/init.d/ contains init scripts, it's not just links to executables
[13:21] <AbhijiT> rams_pandu, hmm then you cant access vista menus programs from ubuntu. you can only access files, folders, data, music, videos, etc
[13:21] <shane4ubuntu> jrib: sudo ln -s /usr/sbin/ddclient /etc/init.d/
[13:21] <jrib> shane4ubuntu: yeah, that's not correct
[13:22] <shane4ubuntu> jrib, ok, should I remove the link and re-install ddclient?
[13:22] <jrib> shane4ubuntu: yeah, purge and install again
[13:22] <rams_pandu> AbhijiT, yeah, I know that. In my hard disk windows and ubuntu are installed in different partitions
[13:22] <Neosano> Do you guys know how can I catch window events? I need to see if there's any window fullscreened.
[13:22] <AbhijiT> rams_pandu, still you cant
[13:22] <jrib> shane4ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DynamicDNS walks you through the configuration
[13:22] <shane4ubuntu> jrib, ok, thanks a bundle, let me give that a try, however is there a way to confirm it is running?  --status-all should show with a plus if it is running?

[13:23] <rams_pandu> AbhijiT, thank you
[13:24] <Attivism> ragazzi eccomi di nuovo

[14:01] <Voita> ok so if I want to configure that script to start an openoffice pres. what do i type?
[14:01] <sipior> Howler: if your dns provider has set an MX record for your domain, you can of course use the domain name you're paying for.

[14:06] <Howler> sipior: Yeah, I have my domain name pointed at my IP address (and my router updates it, should it change).  What you're saying is that I should really make the machines on my local network use that as their domain?

[14:07] <sipior> Howler: if your domain is already pointed there, yes. but if you don't expect the machines on your local network to be reached directly from the larger internet, there's no need for an fqdn. each machine with a fqdn should be listed in an authoritative name server. that's probably overkill for a home network.
[14:08] <supreme> hmm anybody around who can tell me the route add command to route all traffic to ppp0 ?
[14:08] <sipior> Howler: if your domain points to the internet side of your home router, you can use port forwarding to direct service requests from that external address to the appropriate internal machines, without involving the dns further.

[14:11] <elfranne> anyone know how to remove the x first characters on all files in a folder ?
[14:11] <Voita> oliver do I type the pathway under exec=?
[14:12] <Howler> sipior: Sure, I understand that. No reason for the outside world to reach any machine except my webserver. I just saw that sendmail kept complaining about not knowing its fqdn, and I didn't know that I should have one =). But, that makes sense, I really only need a fqdn for machines that can be seen by the outside world. That's why sendmail cares...because why would it be on a machine the outside world can't see.
[14:12] <Howler> sipior: Thanks for helping me understand.
[14:13] <sipior> Howler: sure. are you really running sendmail, and not postfix? postfix is much easier to configure (and the machine itself doesn't need an fqdn, you simply have to tell the mailer what to use).
[14:13] <sipior> Howler: you might also look into ssmtp, which probably fits better with your expected usage.

[15:07] <jrib> ruan: it's possible... see fbi
[15:07] <adub__> running xfce my wireless icon in the upper right has disappeared dunno why how can i get it back???
[15:07] <randyJ> Disturbed1: so, linuxmce is not a user-id on your computer?
[15:07] <gaelfx> Launchpad is sooooo slow in China
[15:08] <Disturbed1> i guess not.  i really don't know.  i'm still a noob at that, and at using terminal.
[15:08] <Disturbed1> lol
[15:08] <skorv> info kismet doesnt give me the path :P
[15:08] <WeThePeople> what is an openbox session
[15:08] <ruan> terminal has an irc client and a browser, so it is quite good
[15:08] <juk> !kismet | scrooloose
[15:08] <ruan> if installed
[15:09] <juk> oops

[15:09] <souterrain> Is it preferable to use x86 or amd64 when installing ubuntu on macbook2,1?
[15:09] <souterrain> i.e., are there any driver caveats to be concerned with using 64-bit?
[15:09] <ActionParsnip> souterrain: how much ram do you have
[15:09] <ruan> souterrain: depends on the specifications
[15:09] <souterrain> 2GB RAM
[15:09] <ruan> souterrain: 32bit then
[15:09] <geekbri> anybody know of good documentation for creating your own init scripts on ubuntu ?
[15:09] <jrib> souterrain: 64-bit installer for 10.10 won't work (see release notes), so if you want 64bit 10.10, use 10.04 and upgrade
[15:09] <juk> somebody removed it, was yesterday
[15:09] <ActionParsnip> souterrain: then either is fine
[15:10] <ActionParsnip> geekbri: bum can help
[15:10] <jrib> !upstart | geekbri
[15:10] <ubottu> geekbri: Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[15:10] <ruan> so it's possible to see an image in terminal?
[15:11] <geekbri> yes i was trying to use init.d so as to make it easily usable on my debian boxes as well :)
[15:11] <souterrain> Any benefit from using 64-bit other than "zomg 64 bit!"
[15:11] <gaelfx> ruan: you can watch movies in terminal using vlc, it's trippy and awesome
[15:11] <ruan> gaelfx: wow
[15:11] <geekbri> souterrain: double the amount of addressable space for the cpu ?
[15:11] <jrib> geekbri: then read /etc/init.d/skeleton
[15:11] <geekbri> jrib: thanks
[15:11] <souterrain> geekbri: yes, but only 2GB RAM...
[15:11] <gaelfx> ruan: it's all ascii artish, but often the colors aren't wrong
[15:12] <ActionParsnip> souterrain: if you do a lot of sound manipulation of video rendering it will help
[15:12] <souterrain> geekbri: 32-bit should go to... 4GB is it?
[15:12] <ruan> i dont mind acii :D
[15:12] <ruan> ascii*
[15:12] <gaelfx> geekbri: double? you're kidding, right?
[15:12] <shaullx> hi, i can't mount my sd card, dmesg prints this: [ 2492.912847] usb-storage: device scan complete [ 2492.913465] scsi 17:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Motorola A853             0001 PQ: 0 ANSI: 2 [ 2492.913855] sd 17:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg3 type 0 [ 2492.917820] sd 17:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI removable disk

[15:12] <ActionParsnip> WeThePeople: did you set a blank pass?

[15:12] <WeThePeople> ActionParsnip: yes
[15:13] <Roasted__> Has anybody used Wifi Radar? I'm using it to map out the MAC addresses of which access points are where in our buildings, but I noticed Wifi Radar is returning me a Mac address that isn't 100% to the sticker on the AP I'm looking at. It's off by 2 digits. Uhh??
[15:13] <ActionParsnip> WeThePeople: and did you let the chkdsk complete?
[15:13] <souterrain> ActionParsnip: oh, the registers are also 64-bit, ok
[15:13] <ActionParsnip> Roasted__: nmap is good like that
[15:13] <ActionParsnip> souterrain: ?
[15:13] <Roasted__> ActionParsnip, it'll handle what I need?
[15:14] <ActionParsnip> souterrain: yes in the cpu the registers are 64bits long
[15:14] <WeThePeople> ActionParsnip: idk, i let the chntpw complete, but i didnt use chkdsk
[15:14] <ActionParsnip> Roasted__: if you are finding mac addresses, it should be fine
[15:14] <souterrain> ActionParsnip: regarding your comment about video/audio editing, I imagine large registers would help in this regard
[15:14] <ActionParsnip> WeThePeople: usually windows panics and chkdsks after you use the app
[15:14] <gaelfx> is launchpad really slow for anyone else?
[15:14] <souterrain> But ultimately I was concerned with certain hardware drivers being 32-bit only.
[15:15] <paulina> yeas you do mbi cos
[15:15] <ActionParsnip> souterrain: yes, SQL servers also benefit too, anything data intensive benefits. Standard word processing and web browsing doesn't benefit much at ll
[15:15] <paulina> ola
[15:15] <gaelfx> souterrain: most drivers are built-in to the kernel, so I wouldn't worry about that so much
[15:15] <WeThePeople> ActionParsnip:  so should i run chkdsk in knoppix for the windows F.S.?
[15:15] <ActionParsnip> gaelfx: its the central point for hundreds of projects, so its usually busy and therefore, slow
[15:16] <souterrain> gaelfx: the weird one is the internal Apple iSight
[15:16] <gui_> yl
[15:16] <gaelfx> souterrain: when the 64-bit kernel first came out, it was a mess getting anything to work, but nowadays, it's pretty awesome

[15:17] <geekbri> im sorry if my dumbing down of 64bit vs 32bit was too simple of an answer.  2^32 vs 2^64.  better?
[15:17] <souterrain> jrib: iirc, I installed xubuntu 10.10 x86_64 without issue... different installer I suppose?

[15:19] <BajK> to make a /usr/share/autostart not being triggered, is it enough to just rename it to .desktop_ ?
[15:19] <Roasted__> ActionParsnip, is zenmap what you were referring to? Isn't nmap an actual terminal app or command?
