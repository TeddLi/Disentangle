[09:13] <Kalessin> ActionParsnip, I understand that but compiz shortcuts doesn't works either
[09:13] <indus> lordganesh: which version of ubuntu?
[09:14] <ActionParsnip> kartook: there used to be an unsupported plugin pack as well with some nice effects, like sonw, but it doesnt appear to be in karmic yet
[09:14] <lordganesh> indus: 9.10
[09:14] <Kalessin> I mean for example with alt+click I can't move a window
[09:14] <ActionParsnip> Kalessin: i'd ask in #compiz
[09:14] <katakbuta> Piet: thanks ;)
[09:14] <indus> lordganesh: so you have windows 7 and ubuntu? also xp?
[09:14] <ActionParsnip> Kalessin: compiz breaks stuff like that good
[09:14] <kartook> i am using ubuntu 9.04 64 bit
[09:14] <kartook> my wife love to see this effect
[09:14] <kartook> but now its not worknig
[09:14] <lordganesh> indus: no i replace windows 7 instead of xp
[09:14] <kartook> need to clean and reinstall
[09:15] <ActionParsnip> kartook: you need to install and configure video drivers to get the effects
[09:15] <indus> lordganesh: hmm so do you see windows 7 option in boot menu
[09:15] <kartook> All drivers are done
[09:15] <Piet> katakbuta: but note that the string your grep for could be anywhere within the 'ps aux' output. so a script called ~/bin/foo-port\ 55555 would match, too
[09:15] <kartook> and i have 1 Gb video drivers
[09:15] <kartook> how to search and remove the all related compiz files
[09:15] <kartook> command i need
[09:16] <lordganesh> indus: no i see previous menu with windows xp in boot options
[09:16] <kartook> from all the drivers config,installed hiddenfiles
[09:16] <kartook> i an very new to this
[09:16] <kartook> all
[09:16] <indus> lordganesh: which live cd do u have
[09:16] <ActionParsnip> kartook: sudo apt-get --purge remove compiz*; sudo apt-get --purge autoremove; rm -rf ~/.compiz
[09:16] <indus> lordganesh: do you have an older one?
[09:16] <lordganesh> indus: 9.10
[09:16] <ActionParsnip> kartook: if you dont have 3D accelleration, you won't get compiz
[09:16] <lordganesh> indus: i have older one too
[09:16] <indus> lordganesh: ok what steps did you do with live cd to repair grub
[09:16] <kartook> i have 3 D enabled
[09:17] <kartook> nvida 1 GB
[09:17] <kartook> i can see the Cube and all
[09:17] <ActionParsnip> kartook: good
[09:17] <indus> kartook: sudo apt-get remove --purge compiz
[09:17] <ActionParsnip> kartook: nice, nvidia is super supported
[09:17] <kartook> only matter i need to enable the if i close the windows thats should burn
[09:17] <lordganesh> indus: i followed this link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[09:17] <Valentina> Piet: Well, thanks for advice. I'm will be able to manually restart the server if it shuts down. I have to take that chance. I just don't want my apartment to burn down. Therefore I was thinking of a way to shut the server down if it is getting to hot.
[09:18] <kartook> now iam mremoved all
[09:18] <kartook> no compiz
[09:18] <kartook> nothing
[09:18] <ActionParsnip> kartook: if the plugin isnt in the packs then you will need to find out another way to install it
[09:18] <kartook> what is the way ?
[09:18] <indus> lordganesh: thats for old grub, you need the older live cd for that
[09:18] <kartook> just type the full line all installables what i need for that
[09:18] <ActionParsnip> kartook: whomever packaged the plugins obviosly removed it
[09:18] <kartook> like sudo apt-get install .......?
[09:18] <indus> lordganesh: boot with older live cd,and follow some steps
[09:19] <ActionParsnip> kartook: how do you mean?
[09:19] <lordganesh> indus: then what is way for new grub
[09:19] <kartook> can i run this command now
[09:19] <kartook> ?
[09:19] <kartook> sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-namager compiz-fusion-plugins-extra and compiz-fusion-plugins-main
[09:19] <indus> lordganesh: screw new grub, ill help you restore with old one
[09:19] <kartook> any thing need to Add on this
[09:19] <kartook> ?
[09:19] <ActionParsnip> kartook: sure
[09:19] <starcannon> burn is standard for compiz, and can be enabled using compizconfig-settings-manager available by that name in Synaptic Package Manager.
[09:19] <ActionParsnip> kartook: that will give you compiz
[09:19] <indus> lordganesh: ok with new grub, just run sudo grub-install /dev/sda
[09:20] <kartook> what about the fire effect
[09:20] <indus> lordganesh: did you try?
[09:20] <kartook> E: Couldn't find package compizconfig-settings-namager
[09:20] <kartook> haa error
[09:20] <lordganesh> indus: should i try from live cd
[09:20] <indus> lordganesh: yes
[09:20] <Piet> Valentina: pretty much all computers nowadays will power off themselves if they overheat.
[09:20] <indus> lordganesh: i suggest using old grub
[09:20] <ActionParsnip> kartook: you can't type
[09:21] <ActionParsnip> Its: compizconfig-settings-manager
[09:21] <ActionParsnip> not: compizconfig-settings-namager
[09:21] <indus> lordganesh: ok first lets try with new, boot 9.10 live cd
[09:21] <Piet> Valentina: but of course it's better to do it by software and have a clean shutdown.
[09:21] <ActionParsnip> namager isnt even a word ;)
[09:21] <suigeneris> how do I burn an ISO using the command line?
[09:21] <ActionParsnip> !burning
[09:21] <ubottu> CD/DVD Burning software: K3b (KDE), gnomebaker, brasero, serpentine, graveman, Nautilus-CD-Burner, GToaster, xcdroast (GNOME), wodim (terminal-based). Burning .iso files: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
[09:21] <starcannon> ack sorry for the typo
[09:21] <ActionParsnip> suigeneris: wodim
[09:21] <kartook> can i try from synaptic manaer
[09:21] <kartook> manager *
[09:22] <lordganesh> indus: tell me all deatailed step , because i have to boot on same pc
[09:22] <Valentina> Piet: Yeah, I hope so, just wanted to be sure it really will adding a script that also will make the computer shutdown.
[09:22] <Piet> Valentina: Assuming you have your lm-sensors configuration well tuned for your hardware, you could just have a cron job run every 5 minutes (or even less) to run sensors and grep for 'ALARM', and shutdown in the event that you find this word.
[09:22] <starcannon> kartook thats likely the best place to start
[09:22] <colt> #reddit
[09:22] <indus> lordganesh: hmm
[09:22] <ActionParsnip> kartook: if you wish, it will achieve the same end, command line is just quicker
[09:22] <indus> lordganesh: boot live cd and come back here
[09:22] <kartook> surte
[09:22] <kartook> i wish
[09:23] <starcannon> Anyone here know an active vintage audio channel?(I know off topic, but I'd really like to find one with people in it)
[09:23] <indus> lordganesh: ok nvm write this down then
=== hemanth is now known as g33k
[09:23] <ActionParsnip> kartook: sure it is, you dont have to load a silly gui, yu can just get on with installing whats needed
[09:23] <indus> lordganesh: this is for older live cd
[09:23] <kartook> any way i started installation
[09:23] <kartook> let we see
[09:23] <Dravekx> i cant get vsftpd to start
[09:24] <Valentina> Piet: Yeah, I guess. I have red some info about that kind of script doing that. The problem is I already having ALARM probably due to the config settings. But if I only get the last line of sensors command output then I will get the system and processors temp.
[09:24] <indus> lordganesh: once booted, open a terminal and type sudo grub , then type find /boot/grub/stage1 , then enter this value in command root   (hdx,y), and finally setup  (hd0)
[09:24] <kartook> installing COmpiz-fusion-plugins-extra
[09:24] <indus> dont forget the space
[09:24] <kartook> compiz-wrapper
[09:24] <Valentina> Piet: Actually, this already says ALARM: temp1:       +35.0C  (high =  +0.0C, hyst =  +0.0C)  ALARM  sensor = thermistor
[09:25] <Valentina> Piet: Because of stupid default settings?
[09:25] <ActionParsnip> kartook: you need: compizconfig-settings-manager   the rest will be auto installed for youo as the manager is dependant on them
[09:25] <kartook> yeah its autoselected all
[09:25] <kartook> :)
[09:26] <kartook> thanks once done iwi ll let you know
[09:26] <kartook> iam in 64kbps /sec
[09:26] <kartook> it wil ltake lot of time to complete
[09:26] <Dravekx> Okay, fresh install of vsftpd... anyone want to give me a heads up on configuring? i cant get the damn program to start.
[09:27] <ActionParsnip> kartook: is it worth all this hasstle for some worthless eyecandy?
[09:27] <kartook> :)
[09:27] <ActionParsnip> kartook: serious question
[09:27] <suigeneris> ActionParsnip, do the options for cdrecord work for wodim too?
[09:27] <kartook> because of my wife
[09:28] <ActionParsnip> suigeneris: not something ive used duder, have a play
[09:28] <kartook> she need to see
[09:28] <ActionParsnip> kartook: see what?

[09:29] <dreno> Hi, I am getting a 404 on darkstat
[09:29] <dreno> can anyone help
[09:30] <sam__> I finally got my USB wifi 160 thing to work under ubuntu but the signal only says like 19% under Windows it says 60%....anyone have any ideas? the internet works but its a bit stop start
[09:30] <ActionParsnip> !ot | meatbun
[09:30] <ubottu> meatbun: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics. Thanks!
[09:30] <ActionParsnip> sam__: maybe you need firmware
[09:31] <sam__> upgrade the firmware you mean?
[09:31] <sam__> for the usb device>ActionParsnip
[09:31] <ActionParsnip> sam__: you may, have a hunt around
[09:31] <sam__> ok
[09:31] <ActionParsnip> sam__: its a file you need to put in your filesystem that gets loaded with the driver
[09:31] <iaindalton> Does Ubuntu have an officially blessed desktop search tool?  It seems Tracker is no longer included in ubuntu-desktop; has it fallen from favor?
[09:31] <glicks> im a little confused now...with ubuntu 9.10 theres effectively 4 different ways to install software now.  there is the Ubuntu store, add-remove programs, synaptic, and the commanline apt.  do we really need 4 ways to do the same thing? which method should i use?
[09:32] <glicks> and why are there 4 ways to do it?
[09:32] <sam__> Thanks for your help over the past few weeks ACtionParsnip....what a mission months worth of research and finally I have internet using USB wifi...w00t
[09:32] <indus> glicks: i dont think add/remove is there now
[09:32] <ActionParsnip> sam__: i try, thanks
[09:32] <Piet> Valentina: apparently so, since this very sensor is set to trigger an alarm for any value larger than +0.0C
[09:32] <dutchbuntu> glicks: there is no method you should use, you can use wat best suits you
[09:32] <dreno> Hi I am getting a 404 when I try to start darkstat
[09:32] <klong> glicks..theres always been a bunch of ways. use synaptic.
[09:32] <Piet> Valentina: if you just want to check one specific sensors' value, then grep/awk for its name, don't just rely on it to be in the last line of the sensors' output.
[09:33] <dutchbuntu> glicks: they are basically all different GUI's to the same back-end

[09:41] <ActionParsnip> !panelfix
[09:41] <starcannon> sam_ did Nvidia list it in the supported cards in the release notes at their website?
[09:41] <kostkon> YazzY, because it's not an applet anymore but a tray app thus, it should appear in your notif area.

[09:48] <kostkon> YazzY, ok
[09:49] <ageeb> action: once i switched back to compiz the shadow came back immediately
[09:49] <Toffe> i would like to bind "2> /dev/null &"="&" in zsh, but I'm not sure how to do it
[09:49] <starcannon> glicks I generally chop up my disk 20gb for / (thats more than needed, but I install lots of crap just to try it), 2gb for Swap, rest to /home, I put them on the disk in that order myself, no problems at all; i've put swap at the end of the disk, and at the beginning, I see no noticable difference in speed in any of the 3 scenarios, so go with whats easy
[09:49] <ActionParsnip> zey: i can see they have a linux installer
[09:49] <crankyadmin> Toffe, bind to what?
[09:50] <ActionParsnip> zey: doesnt look bad for a 40Mb download
[09:50] <glicks> ok, thanks starcannon
[09:50] <zey> @action : how to make LAN server
[09:50] <kostkon> YazzY, could you open a app that you know it puts an icon in the tray, i.e. in the notif area, e.g. pidgin?
[09:50] <ActionParsnip> zey: not sure, i only just heard of it when you said
[09:50] <starcannon> glicks btw, swap should be => amount of ram IF you want hibernate to work
[09:50] <zey> HOW to make an assault cube LAN server???
[09:50] <ActionParsnip> zey: and tab complete nicks, it highlights the text
[09:50] <Toffe> I've tested     alias '&'='2> /dev/null &' , so that when I open a program, the errors aren't written in the bash
[09:50] <UncleD> What software do I need to login to my ubuntu server from Windows XP and see the "Windows" version of ubuntu rather than just the terminal prompt?
[09:51] <Toffe> but it doesn't work. I'm using zsh
[09:51] <glicks> starcannon, so if i have 2 gigs ram, 2048megs of swap should work right?
[09:51] <starcannon> UncleD you mean like a remote desktop client?
[09:52] <UncleD> stracannon; yes thats excatly what i mean
[09:52] <knoppies> glicks, you might want to leave some extra.
[09:52] <UncleD> stracannon i want to remote desktop from windows -> bunutu
[09:52] <starcannon> glicks yeah, make it 2096 to adjust for overhead and too help ensure that hibernate will work if you want it to
[09:52] <crankyadmin> Toffe, Don't use &, use AM and use alias -g AM='foobar'
[09:52] <UncleD> ubuntu rather
[09:52] <ActionParsnip> zey: i think you just run a game and select HOST rather than JOIN
[09:53] <WishingMaster> hi guys, please check this link as I want to know how to change RWIN http://www.speedguide.net:8080/
[09:53] <YazzY> kostkon: yes, it's there
[09:53] <starcannon> UncleD TightVNC will do the job
[09:53] <zey> action : no, i cannot do it
[09:53] <kostkon> YazzY, hmm ok
[09:53] <Toffe> ok, thank you. So I write, in .zshrc, alias -g AM='foobar' ?
[09:53] <starcannon> UncleD http://www.tightvnc.com/
[09:53] <Toffe> I'll try it now. Thank you
[09:53] <UncleD> starcannon, do i need to install tightvnc server on my ubuntu machine?
[09:53] <zey> i know if its should run assaultcube-server
[09:54] <zey> but i don't know how to configure it
[09:54] <ActionParsnip> zey: their may be an option for dedicated server in the app. Have you tried that?
[09:54] <starcannon> UncleD nope, it already has a vnc server and client, just install that to your windows machine, I recommend NOT running it as a service on your windows machine, just start and stop it when you need it.
[09:54] <WishingMaster> ActionParsnip, you gotta a moment ?
[09:54] <ActionParsnip> WishingMaster: sup
[09:54] <crankyadmin> Toffe, alias -g AM='2> /dev/null &'
[09:54] <Toffe> ah ok
[09:55] <UncleD> starcannon, ok what i'm saying is lets say my ubuntu server is ubuntu.com
[09:55] <WishingMaster> ActionParsnip, i want you to have a look at this http://www.speedguide.net:8080/
[09:55] <UncleD> your saying my ubuntu server is already running a vnc server?
[09:55] <crankyadmin> Toffe, then when you need it your-command-here AM
[09:55] <starcannon> UncleD heres a howto I wrote, I think it "should" get you setup they way you need to be http://www.mylinuxinstaller.com/Guides.html
[09:55] <Piet> Valentina: i see
[09:55] <ActionParsnip> WishingMaster: ok, do you use a router?
[09:56] <WishingMaster> ActionParsnip, i have a usb 3g modem
[09:56] <WishingMaster> ActionParsnip, i want to change RWIN
[09:56] <Toffe> Thank's a lot
[09:56] <ageeb> Action: got it figured out
[09:57] <UncleD> starcannon that howto just shows how to install tight vnc
[09:57] <ActionParsnip> WishingMaster: i have no idea about this stuff dude. Why did you ask me rather than asking the channel?
[09:57] <ActionParsnip> ageeb: always nice to hear a success story :D
[09:57] <UncleD> starcannon my question is once ive installed tight vnc, how do i log into my ubuntu box with it
[09:57] <r3za> hi guys , how can i convert many svg file to png ?
[09:57] <ActionParsnip> r3za: install imagemagick
[09:57] <ActionParsnip> r3za: then you can run:   convert input.svg output.png
[09:57] <crankyadmin> Toffe, np
[09:57] <WishingMaster> ActionParsnip, you have answered most of my issues in the past thats why i asked you
[09:58] <ActionParsnip> WishingMaster: ask the channel, if I know I reply. If not I don't
[09:58] <sam__> <ActionParsnip> I did what you said and it installed Sweet
[09:58] <ActionParsnip> sam__: nice
[09:58] <indus> ActionParsnip: :)
[09:58] <WishingMaster> ActionParsnip, okay
[09:58] <glicks> if running a netbook, should i turn on home folder encryption
[09:58] <glicks> what kind of performance hit will that be on a netbook?
[09:58] <llutz> WishingMaster: http://fasterdata.es.net/TCP-tuning//linux.html
[09:58] <glicks> will it be noticably slower?
[09:58] <starcannon> UncleD run the TightVnc Viewer from the Windows Applications menu, make sure you have the vnc server turned on in Ubuntu (System>Preferences>Remote Desktop)
=== DarK``__ is now known as DarK`
[09:59] <indus> glicks:just remember, in case of your sytem not booting, it is impossible to recover it
[09:59] <WishingMaster> llutz, let me check that brb
[09:59] <glicks> indus, can i add that option later?
[09:59] <starcannon> UncleD there will be a wizard that will let you put in the url of your Ubuntu box when you run the TightVNC viewer client
[09:59] <glicks> and remove it as well?
[09:59] <indus> glicks: hmm yes i believe
[10:00] <UncleD> starcannon: I it appears that I need to install vncserver on my ubuntu box though
[10:00] <indus> glicks: but i dont know how
[10:00] <Dravekx> so, 9.10 is crap????
[10:00] <alkisg> There's a GUI tool for editing policy kit authorizations, what is its name? I can't remember... :(
[10:00] <UncleD> starcannon because i hanvent setup vnc on my ubuntu box. ie. no password, no vnc server setup
[10:00] <starcannon> UncleD, it is already installed, you just have to enable it through System>Preferences>Remote Desktop
[10:00] <UncleD> ah
[10:00] <UncleD> thats what i was asking
[10:00] <johe|work> will there be an dist-upgrade from LTS to the new LTS, next year?
[10:01] <starcannon> UncleD look up a ways hehe, you missed my previous post on it :)
[10:01] <dutchbuntu> johe|work: yes
[10:01] <UncleD> starcannon: can i enable remote desktop remotely through the terminal prompt
[10:01] <UncleD> because im logged into my ubuntu server remotely right now via ssh
[10:01] <UncleD> im trying to set this all up remotely
[10:01] <UncleD> so that I can login to the actual machine
[10:01] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: you could always just configure the system via ssh
[10:02] <starcannon> UncleD you should be able to, that'd be a gconftool thing I'd think, or there are other ways of doing it; I have never tried that though
[10:02] <UncleD> where is it located
[10:02] <xterm> A friend of mine have spent several weeks of googling and reading to get 5.1 sound threw HDMI going on a atom330 based HTPC. I have also googled a bit on this and it seems as many have the same problem. Who owns this problem? Why is this a probem? Have anyone some input? Can you choose a better platform for a HTPC than atom330?
[10:02] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: or you could use X forwarding to enable the VNC service stuff
[10:02] <alkisg> Found it: polkit-gnome-authorization ==> but why isn't it installed in Karmic? Something changed?
[10:02] <UncleD> ActionParsnip how
[10:02] <WishingMaster> llutz, well i have performed the steps mentioned in http://fasterdata.es.net/TCP-tuning//linux.html      and looking for steps to change RWIN
[10:02] <Valentina> root will always be able tu execute scripts without changing permissions, or am I wrong?
[10:02] <Valentina> *to
[10:02] <Finnish> I'm making animation in GIMP, in Gif. Everything else ok, but why are my pictures overlapping in the animation, I want them to be just one pic and then the next
[10:03] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: if the client is windows based you will need to install xming and connect with: putty -x user@server
[10:03] <knoppies> Valentina, I wouldnt really know, But I think not.
[10:03] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: if teh client is a linux box with a  desktop you can simply run: ssh -X user@server
[10:03] <UncleD> I have putty
[10:03] <UncleD> and the client is windows based
[10:03] <starcannon> Valentina root can be exluded from permissions, though generally it's not
[10:03] <dutchbuntu> Valentina: no. file still needs to be executable through the permissions
[10:03] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: when you launch gui apps, they will be displayed on the desktop bt be running on the server side (like citrix)
[10:03] <UncleD> so i need to install xming on the server (ubuntu)
[10:04] <UncleD> ?
[10:04] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: then you need to install xming as windows does not have an x server
[10:04] <Valentina> starcannon: Ok, I chmod my script to 700 then user will have full privileges, but what about root?
[10:04] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: no, on the windows box, so the gui apps have an x server to stick to
[10:04] <UncleD> ah.
[10:04] <glicks> does anyone know how to add home encryption to ubuntu 9.10 after installation?
[10:04] <UncleD> so xming is a windows application
[10:04] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: what are you going to be doing on the server side once you get VNCd in?
[10:04] <starcannon> Valentina I just chmod +x somescript.sh
[10:04] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: yes xming is a windows application
[10:05] <Valentina> starcannon: I don't want everyone to be able to execute it.
[10:05] <johe|work> dutchbuntu, thx
[10:05] <Valentina> just my user and root.
[10:05] <UncleD> ActionParsnip: i just want to be able to login to my X ubuntu desktop
[10:05] <UncleD> rather than always having to just login to the terminal prompt via ssh
[10:05] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: but for what purpose? most apps have web interfaces or can be manipulated easily via ssh

[10:07] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: you may find VNC is a bit surplus if all you want to do is manage torrents when many torrent clients have web interfaces you can use instead (much lighter and way faster)
[10:07] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: as an example
[10:07] <UncleD> ActionParsnip: i just want to try it out.
[10:07] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: thats fine :)
[10:07] <UncleD> ActionParsnip: ive been using my ubuntu server remotely from a windows desktop for a few years as a terminal prompt
[10:08] <UncleD> and i'd like to vnc in.
[10:08] <UncleD> the other thing is.. my ubuntu server doesnt have a monitor, i always have to ssh into it from another machine
[10:08] <Valentina> starcannon: Yes, I know, chmod 700 won't let group and owner execute the script but my own user will. But what about root?
[10:08] <UncleD> so i want to see ubuntu's desktop
[10:08] <Dravekx> burning...
[10:09] <WishingMaster> hey guys! does anyone knows how to change RWIN as Default TCP Receive Window ? http://www.speedtest.net/
[10:09] <starcannon> Valentina I believe root should be able to, worst that happens is you have to chmod it again, or create a group just for the script and make sure to add it to root and userx
[10:10] <ActionParsnip> UncleD: cool, i'd stick with ssh if its a proper server
[10:10] <llutz> WishingMaster: see LINUX-part of http://proj.sunet.se/E2E/tcptune.html , all those parameter have to be changed for changing RWIN

[10:39] <rww> jrib: I believe he wants to make it so that users of his computer can't move or delete some applets.
[10:40] <Veovis_Muaddib> jrib: I'd like to be able to never let anyone delete certain panel applets, or even move them
[10:40]  * jrib doesn't understand why people don't ask their real questions
[10:40] <Veovis_Muaddib> Concker: That is wrong
[10:40] <Veovis_Muaddib> Concker: The rockbox suggestion
[10:40] <Concker> there must be some easier way then using virtual box
[10:40] <jrib> Veovis_Muaddib: visit library.gnome.org, read the admin guide about locking down gnome
[10:40] <furtano> why can i execute a bash script if chmod  rw- rights is set (excecute not set)
[10:40] <Veovis_Muaddib> jrib: thanks
[10:40] <jrib> furtano: you can't.
[10:41] <furtano> jiffe, if i make sh test.sh  it runs
[10:41] <llutz> furtano: starting it in a new shell (. script) will always work
[10:41] <Concker> im just looking for a easy to to use program,  not virtualbox etc
[10:41] <jrib> furtano: you're not executing test.sh.

[10:41] <llutz> furtano: just ./script won't without x
[10:41] <furtano> jiffe, oh ? whats executing
[10:41] <legend2440> fdsf:in terminal type      touch newfile.txt
[10:41] <jrib> furtano: what llutz just said
[10:41] <furtano> jiffe, oh ? thought that is it
[10:41] <jrib> furtano: you're executing "sh" and telling it to read commands from test.sh
[10:42] <llutz> furtano: you are not executing the script with "sh script", you execute a shell loading a script-file
[10:42] <bening> can use gppp?

[10:44] <cyaneo> I need gd imagerotate, but ubuntu does nor serve a fully php5-gd version. on dotdeb.org there is a full gd supported "dotdeb-php5-gd2" package BUT for debian lenny.
[10:44] <cyaneo> Q:
[10:44] <cyaneo> - is it safe to use the lenny package on ubuntu 8.04 LTS?
[10:44] <cyaneo> - should I switch my (new) server to debian so I can use this?
[10:44] <FloodBot2> cyaneo: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[10:44] <cyaneo> another option is, to compile the php for my needs - is this recommend?

I`m now on livecd and I get a really stupid bug when I try to install, right after I set up the partition. I get stuck at "removing conflicting operating system files". I notice that this happens only when I try to install with a separate /home partition. Any suggestions, please? Thanks.
[11:09] <sandhya> sisif: a fresh install?
[11:09] <sisif> sandhya : that`s what I`m trying to do right now
[11:09] <scarlet_falcon> sisif: you're trying to do a fresh install? did you format the drive

[11:18] <scarlet_falcon> ssif: did the install fail?

[11:18] <sisif> IS there any way to migrate from ext4 to ext4 without erasing all the data from hdd?

[11:18] <jrib> sisif: isn't that a no-op?
[11:19] <concker> ye but that require then connection on the ipod aswell right? if ssh works as in windows, atm im in some crappy motel and cant get a singal on my ipod
[11:19] <concker> therefor i need something witch goes true usb
[11:19] <sisif> scarlet_falcon : yes. I get an error at "removing conflicting operating system files". This only happens when I`m trying to install with a different /home partition (the old one, form 9.04)
[11:19] <jrib> concker: right, you can't afaik
[11:20] <jrib> sisif: so don't tell the installer about your separate home and edit your fstab later
[11:20] <concker> vinicius_mendes,  showed me this ifuse thingi, but i dident get it to work, followed the guide 100% etc but ipod still comes up as a digital photo unit
[11:20] <concker> but he seems afk atm
[11:20] <jrib> sisif: you "checked the cd for defects" from the boot menu right?
[11:21] <stickyboy> How do you kill X11 in 9.04?
[11:21] <farciarz84> The Composite extension is not available --9.10
[11:21] <jrib> concker: ah, that must be a relatively recent development
[11:21] <sisif> jrib : yes, i did. As I was saying, this happens _only_ when I try to install with the old /home
[11:21] <epinky> fdsf: check this http://www.serverwatch.com/news/article.php/1131431/Apache-Guide-Generating-Fancy-Directory-Listings-with-modautoindex.htm
[11:21] <jrib> sisif: so don't tell the installer about your separate home and edit your fstab later
[11:21] <scarlet_falcon> sisif: as long as you don't re-format that partition that could work
[11:22] <sisif> jrib : i was thinking like that .. but, later how will the user migrating will be done ?

[11:27] <katakbuta> piet *how do i write it if its just '55555' rather than -port 55555
[11:27] <jrib> sisif: no, you mount your partition on /home...
[11:27] <jrib> sisif: just like you are doing now
[11:27] <sisif> jrib : ah. I see :)
[11:27] <katakbuta> awk '55555/ ?
[11:27] <Valentina> Will */5 * * * * /home/scripts/myscript.sh run every 5th minute?
[11:27] <malice> sisif: jrib's solution would work as well
[11:28] <sisif> jrib : so all I need to to is edit /etc/fstab ?
[11:28] <Valentina> Cron job, I mean.
[11:28] <katakbuta> never mind. disregard that
[11:28] <Dravekx> if I have openssh installed, I dont want to install SSH do i? are they the same thing?
[11:28] <jrib> sisif: 1) create users so uid's match up (or don't care about uid and chown later) 2) boot into recovery mode 3) edit fstab 4) reboot
=== bryan is now known as Guest52850
[11:29] <Dravekx> nvm I got it :)
[11:29] <sisif> jrib : the user should habe the same uid (I think). I only have one, and it`s the same name / password / etc
[11:29] <leaf-sheep> Dravekx: ssh is a metapackage for openssh-server + openssh-client
[11:29] <sisif> jrib : should be 1000
[11:29] <jrib> sisif: then you can omit step 1
[11:30] <Piet> katakbuta: almost. it's:  awk '/55555/ { print $2}'
[11:30] <sisif> jrib : ok, let me  give it a try. Thank for all the help

[12:16] <leaf-sheep> xur1z: Speaking of USB, I'm doing it right now because I want to do this sometimes today for the other machine. I might as well do it now. ;)
[12:16] <AJIEXA> epinky: on my netbook I can't use last keyboard symbols - they are work like 123456 etc but the must work like jkliop
[12:17] <the_gamer> rofl
[12:17] <Zsoci> thank you so much
[12:17] <Jimi_Neutral> HI all, I have used clonezilla in the past, updated to koala latley.....ran the setup again for it and its not working anymore...keeps coming up with "init.orig: sreadahead main process (1557) terminated with status 1" anyone come across this before?
[12:17] <differentreality> hi, i am using ubuntu 9.04 and I would like to add on my deskto a gadget that will be a timeline and I will be able to write comments underneath each day or anyway something like that.. any ideas ?
[12:17] <the_gamer> AJIEXA, try staying away from numlock
[12:18] <leaf-sheep> differentreality: What is the purpose of this? By telling us what you specifically want out of a package is more difficult than tell us what you're looking for. ;3
[12:18] <zd>  /window splitv 33
[12:19] <dAnon1> I've got my /home folder separate with the /home partition, there is Tobi and Tobiasz folder, Tobi is my /home partition and Tobiasz is a standard /home folder on / partition
[12:19] <AJIEXA> the_gamer: I have't numlock on me keyboard - I just have "FN" botton and the must work like symbols by default
[12:19] <the_gamer> AJIEXA, don't lie
[12:19] <differentreality> leaf-sheep,  exactly what i said :)   I need a timeline... so that I can write down the course of a project I am running.  I just find it easier to be on my desktop (and not a program), is there such a gadget ?
[12:20] <dAnon1> how do I merge them into /home/Tobi so I can have my configuration and such .blahblah folders on the /home partition
[12:20] <AJIEXA> the_gamer: I can send you screenshort
[12:20] <sp4z> differentreality: is there one in windows? where did you get the idea for this gadget?
[12:21] <leaf-sheep> differentreality: I'm googling for something like that.
[12:21] <differentreality> well... i tried googling myself as well... maybe you get more lucky :)
[12:21] <xur1z> differentreality: my pal swears by the standard gnome organiser tool. haven't tried it myself.
[12:21] <dAnon1> anyone help?
[12:21] <dAnon1> I've got my /home folder separate with the /home partition, there is Tobi and Tobiasz folder, Tobi is my /home partition and Tobiasz is a standard /home folder on / partition
[12:21] <dAnon1> how do I merge them into /home/Tobi so I can have my configuration and such .blahblah folders on the /home partition
[12:22] <aindriu> anyone tried windows 7 yet?
[12:22] <leaf-sheep> differentreality: There are hamster-applet -- I don't know if that's what you want.
[12:22] <dAnon1> and not screw things up
[12:22] <leaf-sheep> differentreality: "Project Hamster helps you to keep track of how much time you spend on various
[12:22] <leaf-sheep>  activities during the day.  Whenever you move from one task to another, you
[12:22] <leaf-sheep>  change your current activity in the GNOME applet.'
[12:22] <xur1z> aindriu: it's on this netbook i just bought. kinda looks like gnome :)
[12:22] <differentreality> axm... xur1z what's the standard gnome organizer?!
[12:22] <differentreality> leaf-sheep,  well... i'll try it out
[12:23] <xur1z> i dunno, he was acessing it via the cal in gnome-panel
[12:23] <dAnon1> why does Ubuntu have graphical interfaces if they don't change anything and you need to turn terminal anyway
[12:23] <leaf-sheep> differentreality: Package --> gtg, I think.
[12:23] <leaf-sheep> differentreality: http://gtg.fritalk.com/pages/screenshots
[12:23] <skx> I suspect my disk to be failing, how can I verify this suspicion? It's a regular laptop 5400 rpm disk with encrypted lvm on it.
[12:23] <skx> dAnon1, it's to make you feel better :)
[12:23] <AJIEXA> the_gamer:  Oh my GOD  - I m SORRY I m really sorry  - you are right ..... how can I not see this ......  - may be it because I buy it over one month ......
[12:23] <dAnon1> I tried to change my home directory and never suceeded
[12:23] <leaf-sheep> differentreality: Yup. Looks like what you want.  gtg :)
[12:24] <skx> dAnon1, "change the home directory"?!
[12:24] <AJIEXA> it's really working  - THANK"S to ALL
[12:24] <Jimi_Neutral> aindriu, yeah i have, its good i think
[12:24] <dAnon1> I mean I created a /home partition for all my data
[12:24] <dAnon1> and / for Ubuntu
[12:24] <differentreality> leaf-sheep,  i'll look into it, thanks a lot
[12:24] <dAnon1> and I've got 2 folders in /home
[12:25] <leaf-sheep> differentreality: Actually, xur1z deserve the thanks. :)
[12:25] <Valentina> Why isn't shutdown -h 0 used in a script that's executed bya  root cron job?
[12:25] <dAnon1> instead of one partition there is a regular /home/username folder from / partition
[12:25] <Valentina> *by a
[12:25] <dAnon1> and my /home partition
[12:25] <skx> dAnon1, I don't understand the problem
[12:25] <Valentina> Why isn't shutdown -h 0 working in a script that's being executed as by root cron job?
[12:26] <differentreality> tnxxxx xur1z :)
[12:26] <dAnon1> where can I upload a screen shot for you
[12:26] <dAnon1> it's easy when you'll see it
[12:26] <aindriu> Can someone please tell me about the filesystem structure and what you'd expect to find where?
[12:26] <xur1z> good luck differentreality ... i'll check it out myself shortly
[12:26] <skx> dAnon1, dropbox, imageshack, whatever you like, adn try to write in one line using my nickname
[12:26] <skx> I suspect my disk to be failing, how can I verify this suspicion? It's a regular laptop 5400 rpm disk with encrypted lvm on it.
[12:26] <dAnon1> in my home folder there is /home partition mounted and a regular username folder which is / partition
[12:27] <dAnon1> I want it to be one folder all on /home partition
[12:27] <dAnon1> can't merge it :(
[12:27] <SwedeMike> skx: install smartmontools and use smartctl
[12:27] <dAnon1> don't want to screw things up
[12:27] <skx> SwedeMike, thank you, I am on it
[12:27] <catmando> hey all
[12:27] <catmando> quick question
[12:27] <bigmack83_> every since i upgraded to karmic (fresh install) k9copy hasnt worked properly. i cant use it to cut the chapters out of one of my dvd iso's to copy them onto a disc and compress them to fit if needed. it erorrs out every time. anyone else experience this?
[12:27] <leaf-sheep> skx: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Smartmontools
[12:27] <catmando> i'm trying to use port a standard apache conf over to ubuntu
[12:27] <steven__> What is the fastest desktop environment out there?
[12:28] <catmando> and it contains some mod_proxy directives
[12:28] <skx> leaf-sheep, I just need a keyword :)
[12:28] <zaggynl> catmando: I like LXDE/openbox
[12:28] <zaggynl> have it running on a P3
[12:28] <leaf-sheep> skx: Manuals are a bonus. :)
[12:28] <srepfler> bash
[12:28] <zaggynl> CLI>all ofcourse
[12:28] <catmando> installing mod-proxy-html doesn't seem to do the trick
[12:28] <catmando> any ideas?
[12:28] <skx> dAnon1, first, do not mount filesystems on not-empty folders
[12:29] <valberg> hi
[12:29] <dAnon1> but it was like that from fresh installed system
[12:29] <skx> dAnon1, umount /home (as root), move any files from away, remount, move the files back
[12:29] <valberg> i have a problem with netbook-launcher in UNR on my eeePC 1101HA
[12:29] <skx> dAnon1, I don't think so
[12:29] <catmando> specifically, it's complaining about ProxyRequests
[12:29] <ronald> hello there.,
[12:30] <valberg> every time i suspend or hibernate my computer, netbook-launcher has crashed when i start the netbook again, and there is no way to get it to work than to reboot the computer...
[12:30] <epinky> aindriu: check this http://www.comptechdoc.org/os/linux/usersguide/linux_ugfilestruct.html
[12:30] <ronald> how to install the ALSA?
[12:30] <valberg> anyone have a similar experience and/or know any fixes ?
[12:30] <skx> valberg, known issue ;\
[12:30] <dAnon1> skx it mounted like that from start
[12:31] <valberg> skx: but no fix?
[12:31] <skx> valberg, none that I know of, I have a link, gimme a minute
[12:31] <valberg> skx: cool :)
[12:31] <skx> valberg, 21 pages http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8284264
[12:31] <ronald> any one know how to install the ALSA driver?
[12:32] <bigmack83_> anyone else experience issues with k9copy after upgrading to karmic. it just doesnt seem to be able to copy or extract dvd/iso chapters anymore
[12:32] <skx> valberg, probably still no fix though ;\
[12:32] <skx> valberg, hibernation works... you can try that for now
[12:32] <andy> bandung
[12:32] <skx> ronald, alsa? you probably have alsa
[12:32] <falcokian> -
=== andy is now known as Guest77042
[12:32] <Valentina> I don't understand. Why is my shutdown script working when running it by: sudo ./myscript.sh but not when running it from a root cron job?
[12:33] <differentreality> by the way, is there some way for someone to easily create his/her own desktop applets/gadgets for Ubuntu ?
=== DaZ_ is now known as DaZ
[12:33] <valberg> skx: well, it is actually the same in my case
[12:33] <ronald> yeah..but my soundcard is not supported
[12:33] <leaf-sheep> Valentina: Use full path in your commands.
[12:33] <skx> valberg, paste the appropriate line from cron
[12:33] <Guest77042> bali
[12:33] <skx> Valentina, paste the appropriate line from cron
[12:33] <valberg> skx: appropriate line?
[12:34] <skx> valberg, it wasn't meant for you, sorry :)
[12:34] <Valentina> skx: Ok.
[12:34] <falcokian> hey..i'm ubuntu newbie
[12:34] <xur1z> valentina: ur script may depend on path vars being available which are set when logged in but not in cron
[12:34] <falcokian> nice O.S
[12:34] <xur1z> cus in cron ur notin a full shell
[12:34] <falcokian> its awesome..
[12:34] <valberg> skx: heh heh fair deal
[12:34] <falcokian> anyone here can help me..
[12:34] <leaf-sheep> falcokian: Ask away the questions.
[12:34] <skx> valberg, anyway, if you find a solution, feel free to msg me ;)
[12:34] <falcokian> about software...
[12:34] <ronald> skx:yeah..but my soundcard is not supported
[12:34] <xur1z> Valentina: you also can check the actual cron cmd being run by inspecting /var/log/*log for 'cron' (grep -i cron /var/log/*log)
[12:35] <gasull> Hi. There was a command for Ubuntu/Debian different than make install.  Does anybody remember it?
[12:35] <Valentina> skx: This is my cron job line: */5 * * * * /home/valentina/check_temp.sh
[12:35] <skx> ronald, give more details, or try ubuntu forums
[12:35] <falcokian> i mean.. PC mobile..
[12:35] <llutz> !checkinstall |  gasull
[12:35] <ubottu> gasull: checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall - Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page, and DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[12:35] <xur1z> Valentina: what file is ur cron job in pls? ur personal crontab or /etc/cron.*/*
[12:35] <skx> Valentina, try */5 * * * * /bin/bash /home/valentina/check_temp.sh
[12:35] <gasull> llutz: thanks
[12:35] <Valentina> Here is the script: http://paste.ubuntu.com/317637/
[12:35] <skx> Valentina, or whatever shell you like
[12:36] <skx> whichever&
[12:36] <valberg> skx: my problem is not that my computer doesn't start after a suspension/hibernation, but only that netbook-launcher is all crashed and there is no way of restarting that single app
[12:36] <falcokian> what software can call any mobile through PC using internet??
[12:36] <epinky> Valentina: and the user? "root"?
[12:36] <Valentina> It works just fine executed from Terminal by: sudo ./myscript.sh
[12:36] <falcokian> like IM skype.. but looking fir free...
[12:36] <skx> valberg, oh, then maybe there is a solution
[12:36] <ronald> skx: i use the 9.04.,then i don't have sound after i install the 9.04 ubuntu
[12:36] <valberg> skx: :)
[12:36] <Valentina> Eneloop: The script has got valentina as a user but is being run from cron job as root.
[12:36] <xur1z> Valentina: but ur not running sudo myscript.sh in cron, are you
[12:36] <leaf-sheep> Valentina: Replace "shutdown -h 0"  with "/sbin/shutdown -h 0"
[12:37] <Zsoci> good bye and thanks so much,have a nice day!
[12:37] <xur1z> Valentina: unless ur cron task runs as root anyway?
[12:37] <Valentina> The script is run by root cron job because I added a echo "test" > test.txt at the end of the script and the file was created during execution from root cron job.
[12:37] <NarbeH> hi
[12:38] <Valentina> xur1z: I have created the cronjob using: sudo crontab -e
[12:38] <falcokian> wow..awesome..
[12:38] <NarbeH> i have Dell XPS m1530, After upgrading 9.04 to 9.10 i don't have sound. what is the problem?
[12:38] <Valentina> xur1z: So I hope it's a root cron job, not auser cron job.
[12:38] <koppe> What is "the best" 3d Graphics Card I can get (allmost) full support for under Ubuntu?
[12:38] <storm_> when I install software by apt-get, ca-certificates-java errs:ca-certificates-java
[12:38] <storm_> E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[12:38] <ronald> skx: i use the 9.04.,then i don't have sound after i install the 9.04 ubuntu
[12:38] <xur1z> Valentina: should be. Might be easier to use /etc/cron.d/ for hte job than sudo crontab -e but that's a matter of taste really.
[12:39] <Dr_Willis> koppe:  i would check out the various nvidia cards/reviews   depends on your budget also.
[12:39] <eddym> hey all
[12:39] <storm_> hi
[12:39] <eddym> Dr_Willis, what audio prg do u use? banshee?
[12:39] <Dr_Willis> eddym:  none really
[12:39] <Valentina> Ok, well, maybe it's the path that is playing me a joke.
[12:39] <Valentina> I'll test to set full path to commands.
[12:39] <epinky> Valentina: try adding "root" before your command on the cron line
[12:40] <NarbeH> i have Dell XPS m1530, After upgrading 9.04 to 9.10 i don't have sound. what is the problem?
[12:41] <storm_> <unconvertable>
[12:41] <xur1z> Valentina: the first thing i'd test is whether the cmd is actually getting executed. grep -i cron /var/log/*log
[12:41] <Lexclu> bonjour les tapettes
[12:41] <Lexclu> quoi de neuf ?
[12:41] <Valentina> epinky: Ok, I thought it would be run as root if the cron job was created by: sudo crontab -e
[12:42] <Lexclu> parlez francais car je suis la
[12:42] <xur1z> that should show if the cron task is firignng

[12:43] <patchon> How can i make a screensaver be running as root, to be able to stop a user from killing it ? (or is that the wrong way of doing things, basicly i have a eventmanager that listens for certain events,  and locks the screensaver based on the event, however if i run this program as root, its not able to lock the screen of the current user, since the display is not available)
[12:43] <Valentina> xur1z: Yes, I think it is: /var/log/syslog:Nov 13 13:35:01 c-3e79e755 CRON[6918]: (root) CMD (/home/valentina/myscript.sh)
[12:43] <falcokian> sound problem..
[12:44] <Valentina> xur1z: Then I find the same line 5 minutes later and that seems to be correct.
[12:44] <xur1z> Valentina: ok cool. so then u know u just need to debug the SCRIPT, not CRON
[12:44] <xur1z> check paths in the script etc
[12:44] <xur1z> ur cron looks fine if what u say is true
[12:44] <JonNight> Hey everyone I just installed OzOs and have gotten almost everything working and happy. But for some reason I can not get my sound to work.
[12:44] <Valentina> xur1z: Yeah, I think so, I'll have to see if the full path will do the trick.
[12:45] <xur1z> debugging is a matter of choosing the test which will get u the most info
[12:45] <xur1z> it's a lot like 20 questions
[12:45] <xur1z> "is it cron or the script"?
[12:45] <JonNight> Its driving me crazy because with debian it worked just fine. with Satanic ubuntu it did not work and now with OzOs is does not work
[12:45] <JonNight> any suggestions
[12:45] <xur1z> "is it ____ or ____?"
[12:45] <mgv2> what can i do about that in evolution? http://img262.imageshack.us/img262/544/13664299.png
[12:46] <Valentina> xur1z: No, it was run as root right now. And it didn't shutdown. There is still something wrong with the script.
[12:46] <joshyfluff> does anyone know of patches for a HP un2400 Mobile Broadband Module Ethernet Adaptor?
[12:46] <xur1z> yes, but now you know it's the script for sure, not cron
[12:46] <xur1z> so u have 50% less possible issues to debug
[12:46] <epinky> mgv2: restart evolution?
[12:47] <mgv2> epinky, i did it already
[12:47] <TheSeeker1> Hello everyone!  I was wondering if anyone here is using Windows in Virtual Box and has tried any windows games through Virtual Box?  Does it work?
[12:47] <Dr_Willis> TheSeeker1:  will depend on the game.. and i imagine not very well.
[12:47] <leaf-sheep> TheSeeker1: If you really <3 Windows Games, you should opt for dual-boot.
[12:47] <mgv2> what is this vb?
[12:47] <epinky> mgv2: Karmic?
[12:48] <mgv2> epinky, yes
[12:48] <llutz> TheSeeker1: solitair works
[12:48] <JonNight> theseeker: I used suns virtual box with xp worked fine for me
[12:48] <falcokian> try fring software for that..
[12:48] <TheSeeker1> Dr_Willis:  Is that because of the virtualization?
[12:48] <epinky> mgv2: open a terminal and type : /usr/lib/evolution/2.28/killev
[12:48] <JonNight> any idea's on my problem?
[12:49] <TheSeeker1> JonNight:  What games did you play?  l'm not looking at anything graphic intensive maybe SimCity and others like that.
[12:49] <Valentina> Here is my "shutdown script": http://paste.ubuntu.com/317750/
[12:49] <JonNight> eve-online :)
[12:49] <forceflow> TheSeeker1: forget anything with Direct3D accelleration
[12:49] <Valentina> It will be executed as root from my root cron job BUT it won't shutdown as it should. It will work in Terminal by sudo ./myscript.sh
[12:49] <TheSeeker1> JonNight:  So I take it that eve-online is pretty graphically intensive?
[12:49] <JonNight> O.o
[12:50] <falcokian> anyone here..know what software.. for PC calling Mobile throught internet..for ubuntu?
[12:50] <falcokian> anyone here..know what software.. for PC calling Mobile throught internet..for ubuntu?
[12:50] <JonNight> lets just say it looks really pretty
[12:50] <mgv2> epinky, still the same
[12:50] <TheSeeker1> JonNight:  Did you do anything special to get it to run?
[12:50] <epinky> mgv2: :(
[12:50] <JonNight> Just learn how to config it.
[12:50] <Dr_Willis> TheSeeker1:  low end casual games can work
[12:50] <JonNight> once you get it going its normaly not to bad
[12:50] <mgv2> epinky, thanks
[12:51] <JonNight> just do not think to play doom 3 at full speed
[12:51] <epinky> Valentina: bettter use /etc/crontab
[12:51] <leaf-sheep> Valentina: Try and run the commmand "/sbin/shutdown -h 0" in the root.
[12:51] <JonNight> eve is a slow enough game I do not work about it
[12:51] <TheSeeker1> JonNight:  What kind of config are you talking about?
[12:51] <Dr_Willis> TheSeeker1:  check the wine app database - that will proberly give better preformance

[12:52] <TheSeeker1> Dr_Willis:  I will do that.  I just wanted to get away from dual booting with Windows.  There is still some Windows stuff I have to run and I thought I could accomplish to things by using virtual box.
[12:53] <DJones> Dr_Willis: The ip address was iraq
[12:53] <Dr_Willis> TheSeeker1:  many programs can work very well in Virtualbox in windows. Games are proberly best to use in wine.

[12:54] <Linux-IRC> geirha: Hi,
[12:54] <leaf-sheep> Valentina: I mean "sudo -i" -- then when you're in root shell, try the shutdown command. Also, you could use "/sbin/shutdown -h now"
[12:55] <Valentina> leaf-sheep: Ok
[12:55] <ShayMor432> Hello , how can i use ls to print the size of files in MB format ?
[12:55] <nonix4> How do I tell udev to put proper permissions for an USB UPS?
[12:56] <Valentina> leaf-sheep: The command worked like a charm from root prompt after first running sudo -i. No problem at all.
[12:56] <MenZa> ShayMor432: du -sh <file>
[12:56] <leaf-sheep> Valentina: You received the "echo" message in the log?
[12:57] <leaf-sheep> Valentina: Oh, run the command from the root too, using full path.
[12:57] <leaf-sheep> the script*
[12:57] <Vtec> Can anyone PERSONALLY teach me how to re-install grub after a windows 7 install? need help personally not some site with a guide, thanks
[12:58] <freeride> hello there
[12:58] <Valentina> leaf-sheep: I did try this at root prompt: /sbin/shutdown -h 0 and it worked without problems.
[12:58] <bazhang> Vtec, you mean grub2 with karmic?
[12:58] <leaf-sheep> Valentina: Okay. I'm thinking it's more of a script problem.
[12:58] <freeride> does anybody know where do i finde trash folder?
[12:58] <Vtec> well i updated from 9.04 to karmic yes, idk what grub came default with jaunty though
[12:58] <leaf-sheep> !trash | freeride
[12:58] <ubottu> freeride: The location of Trash has changed since 8.04, it is now located in ~/.local/share/Trash | Looking for the trash in previous versions: ~/.Trash
[12:59] <lithiumx> What sort of graphics card do I need to take full advantage of Compiz 3D effects, as well as playing HD movies? I'm not a heavy PC gamer, just the occassional OpenArena etc..
[12:59] <freeride> ubottu thanks a lot
[12:59] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thanks a lot
[12:59] <bazhang> Vtec, did you choose to go with the package maintainers version or not
[12:59] <icedwater> Any word on why the Trash location was changed?
[12:59] <Vtec> Bazhang, what is that? Ubuntu Jaunty didn't have any options like that
[13:00] <bazhang> Vtec, when you upgraded it gave you a choice
[13:00] <diddy> Does Ubuntu have anything similar to Window shadow copies?
[13:00] <Vtec> I don't remember that I upgraded from update manager a day before release, not a live cd
[13:00] <Valentina> leaf-sheep: I got the message from echo running it by sudo ./myscript.sh but it doesn't seem to work running it from root cron job. But the script was created a text file in valentina home folder when I put that line at the end of the script.
[13:01] <NarbeH> i have Dell XPS m1530, After upgrading 9.04 to 9.10 i don't have sound. what is the problem?
[13:01] <Valentina> leaf-sheep: Yeah, I think it's the script that's messing this up too.
[13:01] <Vtec> Bazhang, I don't remember that I upgraded from update manager a day before release, not a live cd
[13:02] <llutz> Valentina: place that script in /usr/local/sbin and try again (change path in cronjob too)
[13:02] <Valentina> llutz: Why do I have to put it there?
[13:03] <llutz> Valentina: just for testing
[13:03] <luist> hey... im using openbox and i added xcompmgr -cCfF -t-5 -l-5 -r4.2 -o.55 -D6 & to .bashrc and it works when i open terminator but gives me some errors and message: Another composite manager is already running
[13:03] <Valentina> llutz: Ok
[13:05] <Vtec> Can anyone PERSONALLY teach me how to re-install grub after a windows 7 install? need help personally not some site with a guide, thanks

[13:07] <icedwater> Vtec: you want someone to walk you through it?
[13:07] <Tuju> JasseT: because everything done personally and talked here is just plain noice for everyone else.
