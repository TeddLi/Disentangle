[04:06] <Adrenal> why can't you/
[04:07] <eyequeue> drspin: yours is just a different philosophy than the one i mentioned.  linux allows both :)
[04:07] <froust> "The X Server does not support the XRandR extension. Runtime resolution changes to the display size are not available."

[04:12] <Adrenal> also, there are bots for it
[04:12] <knghtbrd> the problem with jabber is that it is a jack-of-all-trades protocol without a serious following (or good clients)

[05:26] <Adrenal> farruinm: ubuntu-users?
[05:26] <farruinn> the mailing list
[05:26] <|QuaD-> Adrenal: if it had a G5 i would have gotten it
[05:26] <Adrenal> ah, k
[05:26] <|QuaD-> they just lowered prices today too :)
[05:26] <Adrenal> meh, i'm a pc man

[05:26] <|QuaD-> farruinn: its not really that cheap
[05:26] <melazyboy2> what mounts a firewire drive to /media/ieee1394disk; i don't know the name of the script responsible and i need to invoke it
[05:27] <|QuaD-> eyequeue: ubuntu-zaurus??? wtf?
[05:27] <farruinn> |QuaD-: it is in comparison to the rest of apple's line
[05:27] <Orbo> thanks for the upgrading help everyone
[05:27] <eyequeue> |QuaD-:  just dreaming
[05:27] <Orbo> I have another question as well

[05:27] <Adrenal> orbo:42
[05:27] <Orbo> yeah afaik
[05:27] <|QuaD-> farruinn: true, but i could get a pc for that price, probably cheaper with a 3.6 ghz processor

[05:31] <Adrenal> drsping: i would, but wrong country, if u wanna move though
[05:31] <Adrenal> just holler

[05:32] <Orbo> I know my monitor supports 1240x1024 screen resolution, why can't I choose that?

[05:33] <farruinn> estebandido: yeah, that's newworld, are you sure the disk has been burned correctly?
[05:33] <hams> is gDesklets included in warty? or is that something in need to install on my own?
[05:34] <|QuaD-> hams: install on your own
[05:34] <randabis-laptop> yes there are gdesklets
[05:34] <drspin> OS X is nice but it's REALLY slow except on G5
[05:34] <estebandido> it's the one i got from south africa
[05:34] <drspin> at least it feels slow
[05:34] <chrismurf> hams, gDesklets needs to be installed ,but is pretty bloated.
[05:34] <drspin> some higher powered G4 weren't so bad with LOTS and LOTS of RAM
[05:34] <|QuaD-> drspin: for the price they are charging, they should have a g5
[05:34] <farruinn> estebandido: what exactly is the error?
[05:34] <randabis-laptop> you have to install gdesklets, but it is in the universe repositories
[05:34] <estebandido> but, i have a problem... i have to tell gentoo where the kernel is every time i boot
[05:34] <eyequeue> okay, who has a favorite app i should look into?

[05:51] <kakalto> ohk
[05:51] <bob2> kakalto: er, grub installl disk image? what for?
[05:52] <geneo93> well i would recommend at least 256mb of ram
[05:52] <kakalto> bob2, I want to install grub to a certain partition, so it doesn't matter if I ever wipe any other partitions
[05:53] <Darcy> im using 224 now and it works ok
[05:53] <kakalto> Darcy; it REQUIREs 32MB RAM, and 1.8GB HDD space, or 350MB HDD Space for minimum install
[05:53] <Darcy> thanx dude
[05:53] <geneo93> well it should be enough but not for kde and OO
[05:54] <kakalto> but if your hardware is old, you can have troubles installing it, due to driver issues...
[05:54] <Darcy> what about cpu? any idea?
[05:54] <rob__> ive seen it work on pentium 1s Darcy

[05:54] <eyequeue> Darcy:  the default kernel is 386 at least

[05:55] <Darcy> i want to install it on p2-400 256mb ram and 32mb vid card
[05:55] <|QuaD-> Darcy: that will work
[05:55] <geneo93> thats fine
[05:55] <Darcy> only thing is its a compaq
[05:55] <Darcy> yeah, but for some reason live cd didnt worj
[05:55] <geneo93> more than enough
[05:56] <randabis-laptop> it didn't work? in what way?
[05:56] <rob__> that should be fine.  it will be  a bit slow unless you use something minimal like Icewm or whatever
[05:56] <Darcy> GUI stuffed up all fuzzy
[05:56] <Darcy> and wierd

[06:18] <Orbo> is there a was to see if the driver is even loaded?
[06:18] <geneo93> yeah right
[06:18] <drspin> lsmod
[06:18] <drspin> oops
[06:18] <drspin> wrong driver ;)
[06:18] <swj> I just installed ubuntu for the first time using expert. Just a few questions. :)

[06:19] <bitfoo> orbo: try running glxgear in a terminal to see what your framerates are :O

[06:21] <Orbo> bitfoo: 370fps
[06:21] <Orbo> sometimes jumping to 1170
[06:21] <bitfoo> :O
[06:21] <bitfoo> i get 1300fps with radeon 9700 mobile :/
[06:21] <K-Rich> Greets
[06:21] <HrdwrBoB> swj: change 'warty' to 'hoary' in /etc/apt/sources.list and either use synaptic of apt-get to upgrade
[06:21] <farruinn> Orbo: you could 'grep /var/log/[applicable X log here]  [driver name] '
[06:21] <Orbo> lsmod doesnt say anything ati related
[06:21] <geneo93> just change warty to hoary in sources
[06:21] <swj> thanks
[06:21] <HrdwrBoB> gamecat: what is your wireless problem
[06:21] <swj> I just want to see what happens :)
[06:22] <bitfoo> yeh do that
[06:22] <geneo93> repositories that is
[06:22] <farruinn> Orbo: that's because lsmod is for kernel modules
[06:22] <bitfoo> it would be XFree86-4.0.log for you i think
[06:22] <randabis-laptop> Orbo you should be using the fglrx driver for your card
[06:22] <swj> I like ubuntu overall but I would like more customization in terms of install base apps, (ex. no games and such)
[06:22] <bitfoo> so "grep /var/log/XFree86-4.0.log fglrx"
[06:23] <|QuaD-> swj: apt-get remove?
[06:23] <bitfoo> yeh just remove them :O
[06:23] <HrdwrBoB> swj: once you start including options like that, you lose the simplicity of the install
[06:23] <randabis-laptop> swj you should have been able to remove them in the beginning with aptitude
[06:23] <bitfoo> i didnt even see a choice to install for expert lol :X
[06:23] <swj> Quad thanks I am comming from fedora core..so I am new to apt (and linux) and not afraid to admit it
[06:23] <Orbo> randbis-laptop
[06:23] <farruinn> is that what "expert mode" or whatever does for you? puts you into aptitude?
[06:23] <Orbo> i am
[06:23] <randabis-laptop> also, the server option will only install the bare minimum system
[06:24] <|QuaD-> swj: there are great tutorials on ubuntuguide.org
[06:24] <swj> I'll check it out

[06:25] <swj> geneo93, yum is the default in fedora
[06:25] <swj> rpm

[06:27] <gamecat> okay, I need help from someone who has installed a new wireless card into an existing ubuntu box and then joined an existing wireless network.
[06:27] <gamecat> preferably one using an apple AirPort as the ap.
[06:27] <swj> if speaking about yast in terms of SUse..I was'nt impressed with suse
[06:27] <geneo93> sure better than yast or yum
[06:28] <randabis-laptop> gamecat there's entries in the ubuntu wiki on that subject
[06:28] <geneo93> suse's ok i needs some things
[06:28] <bitfoo> suse is PIMP for laptops though
[06:28] <gamecat> yeah... unfortunately, they have not gotten me where I need to be.
[06:28] <randabis-laptop> dang
[06:28] <gamecat> gleaned a lot from em tho.
[06:29] <randabis-laptop> how about the ubuntu forums?
[06:29] <farruinn> gamecat: perhaps you could ask a more specific question then
[06:29] <gamecat> enough that I bought a card with an atheros chipset so I could use the madwifi drivers.
[06:29] <gamecat> on it, farruinn.
[06:29] <gamecat> just sec.
[06:29] <swj> suse never detects my Lcd syncmaster monitors correctly (out of sync) oh irony.
[06:29] <geneo93> well what were u using before wireless
[06:29] <gamecat> yer basic 3com onboard ethernet.
[06:29] <gamecat> ok, here's the sich.

[06:31] <geneo93> swj:  i had it but rearanged things on this box so reinstalling now
[06:31] <randabis-laptop> drspin you'd need a fan controller of some sort, or a motherboard that does that
[06:31] <gamecat> HOWEVER, I can't connect to my housemates' network.
[06:31] <drspin> randabis-laptop: I just don't remember these fans being so loud when I was running windows

[06:31] <gamecat> I know the ESSID and the password/key
[06:32] <gamecat> but I don't know the channel, and I don't know how to work with scanning for networks.
[06:32] <swj> what I can't figure is the difference between a expert install and a straight install (auto) .. I suppose the partitioning for one?

[06:32] <gamecat> now, on winXP, which I'm using now, the network management ware will automatically detect networks in the area.
[06:32] <geneo93> use airsnort
[06:32] <gamecat> yeah?
[06:33] <gamecat> is that part of base install, or should I grab debs before booting back to ubuntu.
[06:33] <gamecat> ?
[06:33] <geneo93> no not partitioning
[06:33] <godsmoke> airsnort is a terrible way to 'detect' networks
[06:33] <gamecat> Okay.
=== drspin [~cole@ip68-2-119-141.ph.ph.cox.net]  has left #Ubuntu []
[06:33] <godsmoke> there is no good application with ubuntu packages to do that
[06:33] <HrdwrBoB> sudo iwlist eth1 scan
[06:33] <gamecat> god damn.
[06:34] <HrdwrBoB> where eth1 is your wireless device
[06:34] <gamecat> so what's my course of action? Do I need to ... hmm.
[06:34] <geneo93> well what other method u going to use then
[06:34] <godsmoke> HrdwrBoB: most chipset drivers in linux don't support that
[06:34] <HrdwrBoB> if you're using hoary, you can apt-get install netapplet
[06:34] <gamecat> godsmoke: atheros chipset; assume I'm using the madwifi drivers since it shows up as ath0.
[06:34] <gamecat> does that support it?
[06:34] <godsmoke> hrm ...
[06:35] <godsmoke> dunno
[06:35] <HrdwrBoB> gamecat: tryit and you will know :)
[06:35] <godsmoke> give it a try
[06:35] <geneo93> gee he needs net to get hoary
[06:35] <godsmoke> I don't use atheros
[06:35] <gamecat> what do you use?
[06:35] <|QuaD-> anyone here using a card with prism2 chipset?

[06:36] <|QuaD-> swj: you are new to debian, and going to hoary? not reccomended

[06:39] <swj> not really to deep...good overview

[06:40] <farruinn> you have to admit though that there are broken packages from time to time in unstable - I mean devel :P

[06:40] <swj> from what I've been reading about hoary...it will be nice when its released

[06:41] <randabis-laptop> farruinn that's the fun part

[06:41] <randabis-laptop> or fix it ourselves
[06:41] <gamecat> invalid project eyeque.
[06:41] <farruinn> if I had a second box I would install hoary on it

[06:42] <randabis-laptop> okay :) that's why the wiki hasn't changed then
[06:42] <swj> reason I don't like fedora anymore is the fact that there is too much outside interference with repos and such...no one can agree

[06:44] <swj> but there is indeed a root

[07:24] <Orbo> bzip2: (stdin) is not a bzip2 file.
[07:24] <eyequeue> Orbo:  that's gzip, not bzip
[07:24] <geneo91> maybe its not set to start at boot
[07:25] <froust> gen: it used to?
[07:25] <Orbo> so I cant use the tar tool?
[07:25] <eyequeue> Orbo:  i think you don't want that j in there, you want a g maybe?
[07:25] <hams> a configure script can't find the ncurses library, does anyone know why that would be the case?

=== froust [~liam@S0106000f6694d7bf.ed.shawcable.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:34] <melazyboy2> No compile anything in a debian derived system you will first need build-essential
[07:34] <melazyboy2> unless you want to do things the hard way, in which case you would probably be using gentoo
[07:34] <melazyboy2> apt-get install build-essential
[07:35] <Tomcat_> I love build-essential :o
[07:35] <melazyboy2> so do i
[07:35] <melazyboy2> getting make gcc glibc libgc6 etc etc etc etc gets v. old
[07:35] <Tomcat_> Damn... I thought it was an Ubuntu invention... but you just made me look in the Debain package db :)
[07:37] <melazyboy2> lol
[07:37] <Orbo> zsnes package tells me that I need a libpng upgrade
[07:37] <Orbo> how would I do this?
[07:37] <melazyboy2> if you apt get zsnes, and there is a libpng that satisfies it, it would get it for you
[07:38] <geneo91> hehe
[07:38] <melazyboy2> if your apt-getting or using synaptic and it bitches, there is nothign much you can do than either to -f (force) it or to msg the pkg maintainer
[07:38] <Orbo> so apt-get install zsnes?
=== aru [~aru@65-102-126-136.eugn.qwest.net]  has joined #ubuntu

[07:39] <randabis-laptop> I installed the xmms-crossfade package, but the plugin is not showing up in xmms...any thoughts?
[07:39] <melazyboy2> gsnes9x sounds like a more mature package off hand
[07:39] <randabis-laptop> I dunno, the zsnes packages works pretty well from my experience
[07:40] <melazyboy2> randabis-laptop: apt-get --purge remove xmms, get the plugin, let dpkg satisfy dependency by getting xmms also and then see if it works

[07:42] <melazyboy2> stick to zsnes, we all have our own preference im going soly on the desc, snes has more interfaces through x, opengl, gnome and gtk -- no to say zsnes doesn't i personally use zsnes on win32, but i also used gaim on win32
[07:42] <Orbo> E: Package zsnes has no installation candidate
[07:42] <Orbo> ??
[07:42] <Orbo> what does this mean?
[07:42] <Orbo> do I have to manually enter a server to get it from?

[07:42] <melazyboy2> orbo when you searched did it show up?
[07:42] <randabis-laptop> do you have universe enabled?
[07:43] <geneo91> prolly not
[07:43] <Orbo> melazyboy2: no,just drops to the next line
[07:44] <melazyboy2> randabis-laptop: geneo91 That is his problem -- but doing it for him won't really help him unless you want to admin his box.
[07:45] <melazyboy2> Orbo: Thats because apt will check your sources in /etc/apt/sources.list, and you are using the default which is Warty -- warty ensures that all software is time tested and secure, zsnes for some reason either didn't pass that or it has proprietary or non-free code in which case it would be in the 'multiverse'
[07:45] <geneo91> well he needs to read for 5 hours then
[07:45] <melazyboy2> so what you need to do is as root, edit /etc/apt/sources.list, and at the end add universe multiverse

[07:47] <newbie> argh
=== newbie is now known as daryn
[07:48] <randabis-laptop> heh purge removing xmms and installing the plugin with the xmms dependency didn't fix the problem
[07:48] <geneo91> well if he's new that'll take a while to find
[07:48] <melazyboy2> randabis-laptop: Ekk sorry to hear that, thats my only idea it worked once with a xine problem, you might have to consult the god of google
[07:49] <randabis-laptop> heh nevermind
[07:49] <randabis-laptop> I'm just stupid
[07:49] <randabis-laptop> I was looking for it in the wrong place
[07:49] <randabis-laptop> I was looking in effects plugins, but it's an output plugin
[07:49] <geneo91> well maybe its a fixed value

[07:50] <Orbo> melazyboy2
[07:50] <randabis-laptop> there's a package called flexold for old flex I think
[07:50] <melazyboy2> bitfoo: Go to their sites find their archive and download a copy
[07:50] <Orbo> k, I updated the source.list before and ran that command
[07:51] <bitfoo> oh so cant do it through apt? :(
[07:51] <Orbo> does that officially add the servers or something?
[07:51] <randabis-laptop> bitfoo there's an old version of flex in the repos
[07:51] <melazyboy2> Orbo: yes editing sources.list adds the servers, apt-get update, makes the computer aware of the change, and syncs your list with that of the server
[07:51] <geneo91> no
[07:51] <Orbo> melazyboy2: great!
[07:51] <Orbo> now I understand

[08:00] <daryn> I am looking at the CD and found a Samba folder
[08:00] <geneo91> dont matter if its bsd dhcp will give you what you need if you have windows broadcating dhcp
[08:01] <randabis-laptop> you don't need to browse the CD for anything

[08:05] <geneo91> are they shared sources

[08:05] <daryn> ok all i could mark it for was Reinstallation

[08:06] <randabis-laptop> hoary = ubuntu 5.04
[08:06] <Orcrist> anyone here use cedega?  I'm wondering if it has all the regular wine stuff plus extras... I want to run a few other windows apps besides games... can cedega handle those
[08:06] <Orcrist> ?
[08:06] <randabis-laptop> it should be able to run windows apps like wine
[08:06] <Orcrist> that's what I was thinking randabis
[08:06] <Orcrist> but wasn't sure
[08:06] <eyequeue> if 5.04 gets delayed until 5.05, will we therefore see 5.11 rather than 5.10?
[08:07] <coulix> like wine ? do u mean they are developing their own stuff ?
[08:07] <randabis-laptop> no
[08:07] <randabis-laptop> :/

[08:07] <FLeiXiuS> I'm under the expert install menu, and I'm asked for which type of partition I would like to choose.  I'm listed BSD, MSDOS, SUN, and a few others.  I'm not to sure as I am always receiving "Error 16" from grub.  Any ideas?
[08:07] <randabis-laptop> maybe I should have said like wine DOES
[08:08] <froust> Anyone really good with mounting things?
[08:08] <randabis-laptop> uh...you want your partition to be ext3 or reiserfs most likely...other options are jfs and xfs
[08:08] <FLeiXiuS> randabis-laptop, those are file systems, not partition table types..
[08:09] <geneo91> froust:  what do you want to mount
[08:09] <randabis-laptop> right
[08:09] <randabis-laptop> I haven't done an expert install so I dunno
[08:09] <geneo91> hehe
[08:09] <froust> geneo91: when i reboot with my usb flash drive plugged in, an icon shows up on my desktop and in my computer (same level as floppy, cdrom, filesystem, network in nautilus)
[08:10] <froust> hwo can i make it reappear when i just plug it in and mount it?
[08:10] <Orcrist> coulix, cedega is patched up wine that handles directx much nicer so you can play 3D games
[08:10] <daryn> randabis: i reinstalled that smbclient but no avail
