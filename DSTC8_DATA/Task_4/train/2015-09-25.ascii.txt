[09:22] <k1l_> saru_: we need to see the logs to get a clue what is going wrong on your system. so we need to see the "dmesg" and "Xorg.log" called logs which are placed in /var/log

[09:48] <blah-> what is the next step in order to change the theme?
[09:48] <vvH1p|a5h> thank you so much guys
[09:49] <auronandace> blah-: depends on what desktop environment the theme is designed for
[09:49] <blah-> gnome
[09:50] <auronandace> blah-: is that the current gnome-shell or the old gnome 2
[09:50] <blah-> auronandace,
[09:50] <blah-> this is the one
[09:50] <blah-> Aurora   3.16, 3.14, 3.12  Updated
[09:50] <blah-> GTK 3.x Theme/Style
[09:50] <blah-> i'm using ubuntu 14.04LTS
[09:50] <auronandace> blah-: good, in that case after you have put it in the .themes folder you then change the theme as you normally would through the settings
[09:51] <blah-> no need to install ubuntu tweak?
[09:52] <auronandace> blah-: not as far as i'm aware
[09:53] <blah-> ok, i open system settings
[09:53] <blah-> and click appearance right?

[13:22] <Anthaas> My internet has been fine so far. I have rebooted.
[13:24] <T3DDY> Does anyone know if I can get openvpn-as on an intel server
[13:25] <boichev> T3DDY: what is "openvpn-as" ? I know what is "openvpn" but I do not know what the "-as" stands for....
[13:26] <T3DDY> Access Server, I have asked in the server group but Im just curous if anyone else knows
[13:26] <boichev> T3DDY: I can see packages for ubuntu on the openvpn site, why do you expect problems ?
[13:27] <boichev> T3DDY: should be like any other installation
[13:27] <T3DDY> All I can find is packages for AMD servers but my servers are intel
[13:28] <boichev> T3DDY: there will be no problems use them
[13:28] <k1l_> T3DDY: the amd64 is the name for 64bit. the patent for 64bit is from amd. its not only for amd cpus.
[13:29] <T3DDY> Thankyou, I know now :P
[13:29] <boichev> T3DDY: Good luck and have fun :)
[13:29] <shambat> I have some dkms modules that are listed as "installed" in dkms status. How can I actually use these modules? the module I want to use is "ixgbe-zc" which is a network driver, while the driver in use (checked with ethtool) is "ixgbe"
[13:30] <boichev> shambat: lsmod
[13:31] <shambat> boichev: lsmod only lists "ixgbe"

[13:32] <utu8o> is it true the laptop battery life with Ubuntu is worse than Windows?
[13:32] <neogarfield> Hi... I just installed Kubuntu 15.04 on a Dell laptop, dual booting with Windows 10. However, I'm unable to see the Windows partition from Dolphin. Any help?
[13:32] <boichev> shambat: run it as root "sudo lsmod" it should return more than one
[13:33] <shambat> boichev: there is no difference unfortunately
[13:33] <k1l_> utu8o: that depends on the exact model. but for some models the battery life is worse than windows because the manufacturer doesnt provide the same drivers for better battery usage.
[13:33] <utu8o> neogarfield, did the grub pop up when you started the computer?
[13:33] <boichev> shambat: if it is hot there try loading it with "sudo modprobe ixgbe-zc"
[13:33] <neogarfield> utu8o: Yes, I can enter Windows or Kubuntu from grub
[13:34] <FenJai> My system is telling me that my cd drive is empty even though I just used the OS using it. Why cant I see the files on my CD ?
[13:34] <utu8o> idk
[13:35] <neogarfield> utu8o: The Windows partition is fine I can access it via Windows. But it is not listed on Dolphin to mount, like it generally is in Nautilus (on other systems).
[13:35] <shambat> boichev: so this is strange. modprobe returns that it can't find "ixgbe_zc" even though I asked it to use "ixgbe-zc"
[13:35] <shambat> boichev: don't you have to provide a .ko file usually?
=== me is now known as Guest65295
[13:36] <boichev> shambat: insmod requires a .ko file modprobe loads them from /lib/modules/(uname -r)
[13:37] <boichev> /lib/modules/$(uname -r)
[13:37] <shambat> ah
[13:39] <shambat> so dkms has built the module, and "installed" it, but modprobe can't find it
[13:40] <boichev> shambat: search for your .ko file in the system and see if it is in the right place, maybe if it is in the wrong /lib/modules/<kernel_version> you can not load, or the name of the module is different. When you use modprobe omit the trailing .ko
[13:42] <Anthaas> Ugh - I just reminded myself why I hate laptops.
[13:43] <Anthaas> I keep tapping the touchpad with my palm while typing
[13:43] <baffledbear> HAHA. I usually turn off the touchpad while I'm typing.
[13:43] <baffledbear> But your internet is working?
[13:43] <Anthaas> It is! :D
[13:44] <baffledbear> Now is the time for celebratory dance.
[13:44] <anony> I installed "Logical Volume Manager" (system-config-lvm) and It seems that I've got 4GB of swap. - The program randomly crashes though. - My initial concern came from 'System Monitor' which has SWAP marked as "Not Available"
=== Yukkii is now known as Dhs92
[13:44] <Anthaas> I wonder if there is a way to set a timeout on the touchpad so that it doesn't work until after 1 second after the keyboard stops being used.
[13:44] <baffledbear> That would be a nice feature.
[13:44] <Anthaas> Saying that baffledbear, I can't do two finger scrolling on this touchpad either.
[13:44] <Anthaas> No synaptic drivers :/
[13:44] <Anthaas> Well, none installed anyway
[13:45] <Anthaas> xinput list shows a PS/2 Generic Mouse installed, so if I do xinput list-props <id> here on that mouse I can see that it uses evdev instead?
[13:47] <baffledbear> Sorry, I can't help you there. I got my laptop from Puget Systems. They preinstalled Ubuntu and most of the drivers were already configured properly.
[13:50] <xela2244> hi, i need to restore my iphone, but i don't know icloud password
[13:51] <shambat> boichev: I tried intalling the linux headers for uname -r and doing a  dpkg-reconfigure on the dkms driver package, and it was reinstalled. Now a modprobe inserted the module and show up in lsmod
[13:51] <boichev> shambat: Good job :)
[13:52] <Anthaas> Hmm, found something in xinput list-props called evdev wheel emulation which was set to 0, put it to 1 and awaiting the results.
[13:52] <noahmg123> The locker for lexde doesn't work. If I put my laptop lid down until is suspends the session and then bring it up, I am greeted by a blank screen.
[13:52] <shambat> boichev: so now the next question is: how do I get the network interface to use the driver?
[13:52] <shambat> use thtool perhaps?
[13:53] <Anthaas> Hmm
[13:54] <Anthaas> Can someone help?
[13:54] <Anthaas> If I enter "xinput set-prop 11 276 1" and then restart, the change doesnt persist?
[13:54] <Anthaas> 11 being my touchpad, 276 being evdev wheel emulation
[13:54] <boichev> shambat: aaaa not really sure, check lspci there should be a row named "Kernel driver in use:" maybe.....
[13:55] <boichev> lspci -v
[13:56] <boichev> shambat: looking it again you can check even in lshw -C network and there is a "configuration" row and inside there is "driver=XXXXXX"
[14:03] <boichev> shambat: if the wrong driver is chosen I know that you can blacklist a module and see if the other module will be used, but the testing probably needs local access to the machine... because I just speculate  and never tried that
[14:03] <Anthaas> Has to be said that not having two finger vertical scrolling is the most annoying part of this laptop :(
[14:03] <Anthaas> I cant get the evdev configuration to work :(
[14:04] <shambat> boichev: yeah I have idrac available in case of emergency :)

[14:16] <phree_node> hi there. what utility should i use to backup my files, applications, preferences etc? i want to be able to recover them on a disk partition of larger size (i decided that when i first partitioned my laptop, i made the ubuntu side too small).
[14:20] <phree_node> So in Windows, I know I cant simply copy my "Program Files" folder over to other computers, because they;ll all be missing DLL files. What about with Ubuntu? If I backup packages and applications I stored in, say, /usr/lib, or /usr/share, can I simply copy them onto a removable device and restore them on another machine?

[14:28] <hexagonSun_> how to save my current nvidia config to my x config file doesn't seem like something that will take a lot of your precious time to answer
[14:29] <baffledbear> Hex: Apologies, I've never used an Nvidia card or hooked up to a TV or I'd try to answer. I'm not familiar with the Proprietary nVidia drivers.
[14:29] <boichev> Luyin: and after the first login if there is a man in the middle this hash will be different and you will know that you are not connecting to the right server
[14:29] <hexagonSun_> baffledbear: I assume most of the ones not answering is because of that, but I also assume I'm not the first person who uses the Nvidia X Server Settings on Ubuntu. thank you anyways.
[14:30] <baffledbear> That being said. Some information that might be helpful is what version of Ubuntu are you using? What card? What kind of connection? I do know that I had some issues with HDMI in 15.04.

[14:34] <hexagonSun_> nicomachus: I don't know, how can I check that? (if I am ussing it without knowing, is it something I shouldn't be doing?)
[14:36] <pbx> phree_node, you need to say what your needs are
[14:36] <nicomachus> well, if you're having to configure your display with every boot, then how are you configuring it?

[14:36] <bishops> boys and girls something is driving me crazy. When I wake my computer up or start it, my wireless goes offline for a bit then searches for a while, then connects to the network. is this something normal?

[14:37] <hexagonSun_> nicomachus: I'm using the Nvidia X Server Settings...
[14:37] <phree_node> pbx, I want to backup: *applications that I stored in various locations (/usr/share, /usr/lib, and so on), *system settings, *stuff I installed with apt-get, *python and java libraries, *personal files, *hardware drivers. But I can't make a complete image of the partition because I intend to restore it on a partition of a different (larger) size.
[14:38] <hexagonSun_> phree_node: Why don't you just enlarge your partition?
[14:38] <phree_node> hexagonSun, this will ruin my Win7 partition.
[14:38] <hexagonSun_> phree_node: that would be a good thing :p
[14:39] <phree_node> hexagonSun, that's so helpful to hear.
[14:39] <cfhowlett> eh?  resizing the ntfs partition is not a destructive act ... normally
[14:39] <jan_> s
[14:40] <phree_node> hexagonSun, don't get me wrong, I don't like Win7 that much, but I need it for certain things. I have grown to like Ubuntu very much and that's why I need more space on my Ubuntu partition. But unfortunately I still need to keep a Win7 partition. And Win7 was installed first, so messing with GParted will ruin the bootloader.
[14:41] <nicomachus> hexagonSun_: are you using the GUI to configure the X Server Settings or are you doing it manually?
[14:41] <cfhowlett> phree_node, assuming bootloader = grub, reinstall
[14:41] <hexagonSun_> phree_node: I'm not so sure about that last part, anyway, you don't have to explain yourself to random strangers on chats, I honestly couldn't care less what you like or not :p
[14:41] <hexagonSun_> nicomachus: the GUI
[14:41] <hexagonSun_> I got to go to class now, I will reconnect later, thank you!
[14:42] <phree_node> cfhowlett, so Win7 was installed before Ubuntu was installed. What does that mean for my bootloader situation? When my computer first switches on, I see GRUB, and it gives me an option to either load Ubuntu or Win7
[14:42] <nicomachus> "why won't anyone help me right nowwwww" - "ok fine I'll try" - "sorry gotta go now byeeee" ....
[14:43] <cfhowlett> phree_node, correct.  resizing shouldn't cause grub to lose the links, but if so, boot your ubuntu usb/cdrom and reinstall grub to fix.

[14:45] <phree_node> cfhowlett, I still don't understand. Resizing the Ubuntu partition will require that Win7 is resized, which will ruin it. Then I'll need to reinstall windows, which will later require reinstalling Ubutntu, no?
[14:45] <CodeChris> odd, does for me. You can pass commands though, check --preferances
[14:46] <cfhowlett> phree_node, false!

[14:47] <cfhowlett> phree_node, more precisely:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoResizeWindowsPartitions#Windows_Vista_and_Windows_7
[14:52] <k0mp0> think i found my answer : http://clintboessen.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/removing-nic-which-no-longer-exists-in.html
[14:53] <phree_node> cfhowlett - so is this right--- I can resize Win7 using GParted, running off an Ubuntu memory-stick. (I assume GParted will also resize the Ubuntu partition with no ill-effects). Then I will likely encounter "booting problems" in Windows. To fix this: plug in Win7 stick, in GRUB choose "boot Win7", it will load up the Win7 installation tool, choose "repair installation"  - this will reinstall the bootloader and make Win7 bootable a
[14:54] <mzaza> I have a server running Ubuntu which we host on a web application project. This project has many members working on it, sometimes on the same file at the same time. To avoid any problem that could occur incase if someone has comitted changes and the other hasn't seen them yet. Is that where revision control systems comes in handy?
[14:54] <cfhowlett> phree_node, if and only if the windows doesn't boot from grub.  my win7 didn't fail when I resized, but it did immediately demand a chkdsk
[14:54] <CodeChris> mzaza: yes, check out git
[14:54] <mzaza> CodeChris: Thanks
[14:55] <phree_node> cfhowlett - so you begain with Ubuntu, and made a Win7 partition? Instead of the other way round (which is supposedly easier)??
[14:55] <Geosearchef> Does anyone of you have some experience with nvidia optimus systems using bumblebee?
[14:56] <cfhowlett> phree_node, no I did it right.  windows + ubuntu.  I later realized I needed to re-partition to gain some extra space and add a dedicated /home.
[14:56] <phree_node> cfhowlett - oh like me
[14:56] <cfhowlett> phree_node, great minds ... :)
[14:56] <dpluth> cfhowlett: couldn't phree_node resize windows from within windows? I think it'd be a bit safer
[14:56] <nicomachus> dpluth: no..
[14:57] <cfhowlett> dpluth, I did advise him of that option via the link
[14:57] <phree_node> dpluth - Windows has Disk Management, but it only lets you resize Win7 partition a tiny bit normally - because Windows puts page files and other things at the very end of the partition table.
[14:57] <nicomachus> wait, what? You can resize a windows partition from within that partition...?
[14:57] <CodeChris> I think that improved a lot with W8 phree_node
[14:58] <phree_node> nicomachus - yes that's correct, using the "disk management" utility
[14:58] <nicomachus> windows is weird.
[14:58] <cfhowlett> never used it.  gparted = magic

[14:59] <phree_node> still though, the question was germane because it was about how to get Ubuntu and Win happily side by side, after resizing them both.
[15:00] <cfhowlett> phree_node, read the last link I sent, take your time, double check before you <return> and of course, do all your backups before you do any of the above
[15:01] <phree_node> let's imagine I choose to go the GParted route like cfhowlett suggested. Can I make a backup of my drivers before I take the plunge? Because after much tinkering and updating, things are finally running quite smooth - I'd hate to think how things would go after a total fresh reinstall.
[15:01] <xpl0iter> Why would this error come: sudo: unable to resolve host ip-172-31-129-114
[15:02] <CodeChris> You could run cloneziller phree_node  so you have an exact copy of your existing HDD
[15:02] <xpl0iter> When I type sudo with any command, this error comes
[15:02] <cfhowlett> phree_node, apt-get download will grab the .debs.  save those to a save spot and dpkg -i          should the need arise
[15:02] <cfhowlett> but yeah, cloning might just be the wiser option
[15:02] <phree_node> CodeChris yeah but that's no good because I'm resizing partitions.
[15:02] <CodeChris> Well, if it goes wrong you can start again
[15:02] <CodeChris> just put the backup back on the HDD and try again
[15:03] <phree_node> cfhowlett: sorry just to clarify - runing "sudo apt-get download" will download and store .debs of my drivers someplace? where?
[15:03] <cfhowlett> phree_node, where you decide
[15:03] <mustmodify> I doubled my RAM and now I'm having problems with networking and video issues. I looked through my syslog and found "BAD grad_size" ... could that be related?

[15:04] <cfhowlett> phree_node, and that's sudo apt-get download packagenamehere
[15:05] <cfhowlett> actually you need not sudo
[15:05] <phree_node> cfhowlett well how do I know what all my driver pakages are called?
[15:05] <lehzm> how do i search for an installed package at the cli?
[15:05] <lehzm> i want to purge an app but dont know its name
[15:05] <cfhowlett> phree_node, gotta research that one yourself.  what drivers are you referring to??
[15:05] <pbx> lehzm, what do you know about it?
[15:05] <lehzm> can i pipe an include or grep?
[15:06] <lehzm> its quake
[15:06] <lehzm> but dont know the exact pkg

[15:22] <gunfus> brothersome: right.. MBR(disk1 bootable) ---points to---> grub2 src files (disk2)..
[15:23] <brothersome> gunfus, Yes, and your grub2 files are in the filestructure of your Xubuntu
[15:23] <gunfus> brothersome: what I want to do now..is leave grub2 only on disk2, and create a new partition that I can use for adding storage to my LVM on disk1
[15:23] <gunfus> right
[15:24] <gunfus> brothersome: okay.. so maybe the solution is mount grub2 on disk1, then..

[15:25] <darkonlight> hi
[15:25] <darkonlight> one question. have wine and several program. how block out/in traffic from wine
[15:25] <darkonlight>  or program which work in wine
[15:25] <cfhowlett> !ufw | darkonlight,
[15:25] <ubottu> darkonlight,: Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has built-in firewall capabilities. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | GUI frontends such as gufw and ufw-kde also exist. | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo
[15:26] <brothersome> gunfus, ok, make a small linux partition on disk 1 (ext3/ext4) and copy the grub2 files there and use the repair disk for grub2 to see if you can change to point the MBR to the right grub2 files
[15:26] <cool_boy> hi, how do I access ftp on ubunutu terminal? I am trying like ftp local_ip_address_ftp_running_on:port
[15:26] <cool_boy> it doesn't connect me to ftp
[15:26] <brothersome> cool_boy, Why don't you use FileZilla?
[15:27] <cool_boy> brothersome: because I needing to test it on a linux server
[15:27] <gunfus> brothersome: hmm yeah.. the problem is that disk1 has barely any space.. thus the reason for trying to make a new partition on disk2..
[15:27] <gunfus> hmm
[15:27] <darkonlight> thanks
[15:28] <gunfus> brothersome: I think I am just going to have to bite the bullet and move files around..
[15:29] <brothersome> gunfus, I am serious about that repair disk - so you always have an option to repair
[15:29] <gunfus> brothersome: okay.. will do.. hopefuly I can put the repair disk stuff on a USB key or something.. who uses disks now a days..? I don't even have a CD-ROM on that unit
[15:30] <brothersome> cool_boy, So you are talking about Ubuntu-server edition without any gui
[15:30] <nicomachus> cool_boy: are you sure the FTP server is configured properly and is set to listen?
[15:30] <brothersome> gunfus, yes
[15:30] <gunfus> brothersome: cool thanks for the response.. that is whay I mostly needed a linux-buddy-to-talkt-to
[15:30] <cool_boy> brothersome: yes on filezilla it is listening and working well
[15:30] <cool_boy> brothersome: yes through terminal
[15:30] <albert> i'm using xubuntu and i cant restart the system but if i choose the poweroff option then it turns frezzie before off
[15:30] <albert> anybody knows how can i fix this?
[15:30] <nicomachus> "it turns frezzie"?
[15:31] <brothersome> cool_boy, I use openssh for my webserver - that works fine
[15:31] <albert> i can restart the system without problems (fixed) but i can not to poweroff
[15:31] <albert> because it turns frezzer
[15:31] <albert> freeze
[15:32] <albert> crash, break, blocked
[15:33] <nicomachus> albert: I'm reading some interesting threads... do you have AMD/ATI drivers installed?
[15:33] <albert> is a new installation
[15:34] <nicomachus> albert: ok, is there an AMD graphics card in the machine?
[15:35] <albert> i found a suposed solution and this consist to change the /etc/default/grub and add something like 'acpi=force' but it not works for me
[15:36] <nicomachus> what version of xubuntu?
[15:36] <albert> if i type the command 'lspci | grep AMD' it returns nothing
[15:36] <albert> the same if i try with ATI
[15:36] <OerHeks> lspci | grep VGA
[15:36] <albert> xubuntu 14.04
[15:36] <cool_boy> brothersome: thing is I am working on a document management software which implements ftp, I am able to get it working using filezilla would like to get it working through command line so I can test it on server as locally
[15:36] <nicomachus> albert: some solutions here you may try: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2217602
[15:37] <geosearchef>  How do I install a driver for a dedicated graphics card on an optimus laptop (haswell + gt 740m)? When using optirun i just get the error: "Cannot access secondary gpu". (dmesg: http://paste.ubuntu.com/12555400/)
[15:38] <cool_boy> brothersome: I need to pass username of ftp user(which is not a system user but only a user in a database)
[15:39] <Bundestrojaner> any idea how i can fix this error while installing gdb-arm-none-aebi:
[15:39] <Bundestrojaner> dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/gdb-arm-none-eabi_7.6.50.20131218-0ubuntu1+1_amd64.deb (--unpack):  trying to overwrite '/usr/share/man/man1/gdb.1.gz', which is also in package gdb 7.7.1-0ubuntu5~14.04.2

[15:39] <crayolarx> albert: what does your /var/log/syslog say it is hanging on when you try to restart?
[15:40] <brothersome> coolboy, not the same as ssh? open user@localhost ?
[15:41] <nicomachus> Bundestrojaner: try sudo dpkg --configure -a
[15:41] <jpds> Bundestrojaner: Remove gdb?
[15:43] <Bundestrojaner> nicomachus: and than try again?
[15:43] <nicomachus> then try sudo apt-get install -f
[15:45] <cool_boy> brothersome: I found it thanks, while specifying port it takes space not ':', what I was trying
[15:45] <cool_boy> thanks
[15:46] <Bundestrojaner> nicomachus: http://paste.ubuntu.com/12555638/ it didn't install it...
[15:46] <Bundestrojaner> the listed packages for autoremove are the dependencies
[15:47] <albert> crayolarx: nothing is working
[15:47] <nicomachus> autoremove, and then try re-installing gdb-arm-none-aebi
[15:50] <Bundestrojaner> nicomachus: same problem. shall i try to remove gdb? but i think it's not unusual to have dgb for more than one architecture?
[15:51] <Bundestrojaner> so i have no idea why the packages block each other
[15:51] <nicomachus> purge them all and then reinstall the ones you need I guess.

[15:53] <cfhowlett> xela2244, only one. Ask APPLE not ubuntu
[15:53] <crayolarx> albert: so you only have issues with restarting?
[15:54] <xela2244> i tried using idevicerestore
[15:54] <albert> i dont understand nothing........ now is working well in anyway....
[15:54] <cfhowlett> xela2244, you are in the wrong channel.  we can't help you. ask apple
[15:55] <xela2244> well, does someone know how to install idevicerestore?
[15:55] <albert> crayolarx: restarting runs correctly since the first moment, the problem was when i choose 'shutdown' option (Apagar in spanish)
[15:55] <cfhowlett> xela2244, you are trolling us, right?  ha ha not funny.  go to apple.
[15:55] <xela2244> apple tells me that i need icloud password
[15:56] <albert> lol
[15:56] <cfhowlett> and now you are ignored.  later
[15:56] <nicomachus> xela2244: there is nothing we can do for you.

[15:57] <ubottu> mikkqu "easily" ????: The core of Ubuntu is the Linux kernel: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel - You shouldn't have to compile your own, and if you need to troubleshoot issues, you can try a !Mainline kernel instead, but if you insist, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile (see also !Stages)
[15:57] <mikkqu> i've tried the way from the faq, but it failed at "apt-get source linux-image-`uname -r`"
[15:57] <mikkqu> i got the following messages: Picking 'linux-lts-raring' as source package instead of 'linux-image-3.8.0-19-generic'

[15:58] <xela2244> https://github.com/libimobiledevice/idevicerestore
[15:58] <mikkqu> is it okay, if I just take vanilla kernel from git? 3.8.0-19?
[15:59] <mikkqu> i don't want unexpected effects, so I would like to use the same version that I have now, just with changed option
[15:59] <mikkqu> and i can't figure out why apt-get suggesting me to get "lts-raring" src instead of what i'm currently use
[15:59] <MonkeyDust> mikkqu  there's also #ubuntu-kernel

[16:02] <h00k> xela2244: if it's something you need to compile, you might need build-essentials (sudo apt-get install build-essentials)

[16:10] <atdiehm> Hey guys, got a machine in my office here that kernel panics... the girl said he was giving her fits last week, too, but she'd reboot it and it'd be fine.  (3 beeps from the tower, and then kernel panic ) ... I booted onto the live cd, ran fdsk, it said there were errors, but it didn't seem to say anything needed repairs.  Any thoughts/ideas?

[16:12] <nicomachus> atdiehm: in my experience, kernel panics are always untraceable. However, the first thing to check is usually hardware. HDD, HDD cable, RAM. something is pushing out corrupt bits.

I want to know what terminal my ruby application is running in because of discrepencies between SGR codes. I want certain SGR constants in my application to be different based on the terminal the program is running in. Now, ENV['TERM'] for a gnome terminal in Ubuntu returns "xterm". I was hoping for "gnome 6.1.3" but is "xterm" all I need? Gnome is a sor
[16:13] <atdiehm> I flipped out the ram... I'm assuming the disc has some errors, but I was confused that fsck didn't ask me to fix anything
[16:13] <bazbing80> I thought this was the Ruby channel :P But as you can see it's mostly an Ubuntu question
[16:13] <atdiehm> i guess I was hoping fsck would fix things, and I could reboot all happy-like
[16:14] <zathras> atdiehm, try smartmon-tools
[16:14] <zathras> also memtest86
[16:14] <atdiehm> smartmon-tools is something on the live dvd then?
[16:15] <zathras> no idea. I rarely use ubuntu.
[16:15] <zathras> it probably is
[16:15] <zathras> also check dmesg
[16:15] <atdiehm> I would have run memtest, but as I mentioned since I flipped out ram with another machine and got the same 3 beeps and kernel panic, I figured it was safe to say the ram isn't an/the issue
[16:15] <nicomachus> atdiehm: SMART disk check is on the live disk, yes.
[16:15] <zathras> you are probably right, yet assumption is the mother of all all f*ck ups
[16:15] <nicomachus> that'll check your HDD
[16:16] <atdiehm> kk
[16:16] <atdiehm> kuz if I can run ubuntu fine off the DVD... that seems like a solid indication that the issue is storage related, eh?
[16:19] <bazbing80> Are all terminals based on xterm the same? Are all sgr codes, for example, the same between gnome and another terminal based on xterm?
[16:22] <zathras> How can I fix (in Ubuntu Precise): perl : Depends: perl-base (= 5.14.2-6ubuntu2) but 5.14.2-6ubuntu2.4 is to be installed

[16:53] <cfhowlett> lehzm, but the clever folk install ONE ubuntu, add virtualbox and test ... whatever they want to test in the box
[16:53] <cfhowlett> nicomachus, false.  12.04 and 14.04 are both available and supported

[17:48] <genii> CreativeWolf: So your kernel is 32bit, binary is 32bit. Although according to uname, it's running on a 64 bit machine. It makes the "exec format error" very odd, that's usually what you see when trying to run a binary of a different platform than the kernel

[17:50] <C_minus> hello can I check if I've understood something correctly? Problem: I have dual boot Win7 and Ubuntu, but I made the Ubuntu partition too small. Solution: Use my Ubuntu installer mem-stick to open GParted, shrink the Win7 partition and grow the Ubuntu partition. Confusing part: I may encounter problems booting into either OS, because of bootloaders being erased. In this case, I must use the Win7 and/or Ubuntu installer sticks to repa

[18:02] <C_minus> sorry got cut off there
[18:03] <parapan> MonkeyDust: with that procedure you can reset the root password ?
[18:03] <parapan> or you have to have a different than root username ?
[18:04] <genii> CreativeWolf: Yeah, that output looks fine, although you do still have legacy location of just /lib/ instead of the current location of /lib/i386-linux-gnu/
[18:04] <CreativeWolf> genii, hmmm
[18:06] <k1l_> C_minus: just from resizing the partitions (and not changing the amount or the sporting of them) should not interfer with the bootloader
[18:07] <genii> CreativeWolf: Do the files listed on the ldd output which are in just /lib/  ( libip4tc.so.0  libip6tc.so.0 and  libxtables.so.10 ) also exist in the /lib/i386-linux-gnu/   directory?
[18:07] <C_minus> k1l so is this just a kind of disclaimer about something that MIGHT happen, but shouldn't normally?
[18:08] <k1l_> C_minus: its murphys law. if you dont have backups of the important files things will go wrong :)
[18:09] <genii> CreativeWolf: Because it might be a case where it's using the ones in /lib/ first where it finds them but later editions in the other one might be what's needed

[18:12] <k1l_> C_minus: well. i never heard of that issue mentioned there. also i always suggest to use the resize tools from inside windows system settings to resize the windows. but gparted does the job, too

[18:16] <C_minus> IS this how GRUB works: Small bootloader that allows each OS to keep its own bootloader in its own partition (chain-bootloading?)? So Win7 has it's own one, Ubuntu has another one... No?

[18:31] <C_minus> Why do people say it's easier/better to begin with Win7 and then install Ubuntu?
[18:31] <C_minus> (rather than the other way round)?
[18:31] <Finetundar> C_minus: because, 7 will override grub
[18:31] <MonkeyDust> C_minus  because windows ruins the grub menu
[18:32] <Finetundar> C_minus: Trust me, I've done it too many times
[18:32] <C_minus> But then can't I just run the Ubuntu installer stick and hit "repair"?
[18:32] <genii> C_minus: Windows only wants it's own bootloader to be installed and doesn't play nice with other ones
[18:32] <k1l_> C_minus: the windows install will override all bootloaders and doesnt care about other OS
[18:32] <MonkeyDust> C_minus  yes, you can repair it, if you like to fix things
[18:33] <k1l_> C_minus: of course you can. but its kind of doubled work.
[18:33] <k1l_> C_minus: and windows wants to sit in the first partitions in most times.
[18:33] <MonkeyDust> some people actually like to break and fix things
[18:33] <C_minus> So it's actually pretty easy - just more work/sitting around waiting for progress bars to fill up?

[18:33] <Finetundar> C_minus: no
[18:34] <C_minus> what else do you have to do besides running the Ubuntu rpair stick then? Because that sounds pretty easy
[18:34] <Finetundar> C_minus: Unless things have changed there's a lot of terminal work required to restore grub
[18:34] <k1l_> C_minus: the easiest way is to install windows and then ubuntu. the other ways do work but need more work. that is way most guides and people say: do it the easy way

[18:37] <C_minus> what kind of things in terminal? if I need to run the Win7 bootloader repair tool, will that mess up the Ubuntu bootloader/GRUB?
[18:39] <Finetundar> C_minus: almost guranteed. I have a bunch of guides bookmarked on my computer at home. But why do you want to install windows after installing ubuntu?

[18:40] <k1l_> C_minus: you are making that a lot more complicated than it should be
[18:40] <Finetundar> ^^
[18:41] <C_minus> I already have Win7 and Ubuntu. But Ubuntu needs to gro, Win7 needs to shrink.

[19:13] <Rimann> SCHAAPI137 WINE does this often? installation was going well until workspaces froze my pc and I had to reboot
[19:13] <Rimann> Finetundar reinstall WINE?
[19:13] <b-yeezi> I've been banging my head on this issue for a while and can't seem to find an answer
[19:13] <Finetundar> Rimann: no, no, just the .NET 4 component

[19:18]  * m3n3chm0 nasZ
[19:18] <reisio> Uhtred: what're you able to do?
[19:20] <Uhtred> After following a few sites and this one in particular (http://hgdev.co/installing-ubuntu-15-04-on-the-dell-xps-13-9343-2015-a-complete-guide-update/) I am still only getting to "No bootable device found."
[19:21] <Finetundra> Rimann: so open a terminal and type" winetricks --gui"
[19:21] <Rimann> Uhtred: are you able to get into BIOS? I have to specifically command my pc to boot Ubuntu due to some changes i made in the boot order while installing.
[19:21] <Rimann> Fintundra: ok
[19:22] <Uhtred> Rimann: I do have access to the BIOS.
[19:22] <Finetundra> Rimann: is it up?
[19:23] <Rimann> Finetundra yes it warned me about being in 64 bit
[19:23] <Rimann> but its up
[19:23] <Finetundra> eh, doesn't matter
[19:24] <Finetundra> so, tick Select default wineprefix cand click ok
[19:24] <MannyLNJ> I'm trying to setup a PPPTP VPN comnnection into my home network. When I try to add the connection it's greyed out
[19:24] <Rimann> Uhtred try looking in your boot options, sorry thats all the help I can give you. Its how i do mine and im new to this
[19:25] <Rimann> Finetundra ok complete
[19:25] <Uhtred> Rimann: I have tried to set the UEFI to the grub but it will not allow me to apply the change. I have full admin control of the BIOS as well.
[19:25] <Finetundra> ok now tick install a windows dll or component and click ok
[19:26] <Rimann> done
[19:27] <Finetundra> now go tick the box that says dotnet40 and click ok and then follow all the instructions it throws up. It may provide warnings but ignore those
[19:28] <Rimann> error this package does not work on 64 bit package: should I just reinstall wine on a 32 bit package?
[19:28] <Finetundra> Rimann: yeah
[19:28] <Rimann> Finetundra thank you I will do that and hopefully it will resolve the problem
[19:29] <Finetundra> Rimann: the 32 bit version of wine usually works much better than the 64 bit.
[19:30] <CarlFK> system settings, time and date, clock, [x] time in other locations, Choose Locations....  Where are those stored?
[19:31] <Rimann> Finetundra: awesome good to know
[19:31] <garle> hi
[19:31] <Finetundra> Rimann:  WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=/home/<yourusername>/.wine/
[19:31] <CarlFK> I can't add any.  if it is a text file I'll just add a text file.
[19:31] <Finetundra> Rimann: that;ll wipe and replace the 64 bit prefix
[19:31] <b-yeezi> I just figured it out. ufw was blocking the vpn
[19:32] <Finetundra> Rimann: run in terminal
[19:33] <quants_> guys im wanting to improve security on my system, any advice?
[19:34] <SCHAAP137> in which aspects quants_ ?
[19:34] <Rimann> Finetundra: Nice thats  much simpler than what I was just about to try
[19:34] <Finetundra> Rimann: :)
[19:34] <quants_> SCHAAP137 i want to ensure im safe while online
[19:34] <SCHAAP137> quants_: in a software sense?
[19:36] <Finetundra> Rimann: you'll find that you can have more than one wineprefix and different versions per prefix. It can get crazy
[19:36] <Bashing-om> !virus | quants_
[19:36] <ubottu> quants_: Antivirus is something you don't need on !Linux, except where files are then passed to Windows computers (perhaps using Samba). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus
[19:37] <quants_> <Bashing-om> why dont i need protection?
[19:37] <wileee> quants, your question is rather vague, safe is your definition, you're the safe factor in the end, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicSecurity
[19:39] <Bashing-om> quants_: If this is a stand-alone system. uninx is a cloased system and nothing can get to the 'root' of the system unless YOU do something that is ILL advised . Presently there are no known viruses in the wild that will effect linux .

[19:40] <Uhtred> Needing help installing Ubuntu on Dell XPS 13 (9343) Developers Edition. After install I am not able to boot to the new install. After following a few sites and this one in particular (http://hgdev.co/installing-ubuntu-15-04-on-the-dell-xps-13-9343-2015-a-complete-guide-update/) I am still only getting to "No bootable device found."
[19:40] <SCHAAP137> Uhtred: have you tried entering the UEFI boot menu? there might be an entry for Ubuntu in there
[19:41] <quants_> <Bashing-om> i am using Ubunto 14.04 lts
[19:41] <nicomachus> I thought the XPS 13 came with it preinstalled?
[19:41] <Uhtred> SCHAAP137: I have and I am not able to apply the change so it is lost as soon as I exit the BIOS.
[19:42] <Bashing-om> quants_: The distro and release makes no difference so long as it has continued support . If this is a stand-alone system you have nothing to fear .
[19:42] <SCHAAP137> Uhtred: similar issue is described here: http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/os-applications/f/4613/t/19631468
[19:43] <SCHAAP137> about not being able to change UEFI boot order
[19:43] <quants_> <Bashing-om> stand alone??
[19:43] <SCHAAP137> Uhtred: it could be that "Secure Boot" is playing a part in this
[19:44] <Uhtred> SCHAAP137: I have checked that as well and it is disabled. It was disabled by default since this Laptop came with Ubuntu installed on it.]
[19:44] <SCHAAP137> ah okay
[19:44] <Bashing-om> quants_: This system is not  part of a larger LAN or working in a server environment. ( linux can be a carrier to Windows of a virus ) .
[19:45] <quants_> <Bashing-om> no, its a personal laptop
[19:46] <MannyLNJ> Any CLI tools to help me figure out why my VPN won't connect?
[19:46] <SCHAAP137> Uhtred: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[19:46] <SCHAAP137> maybe this could work
[19:47] <Uhtred> SCHAAP137: Thanks, I will give these a shot and come back with my results.
[19:47] <SCHAAP137> Uhtred: read the link i sent you, i got it from there
[19:47] <Bashing-om> quants_: Then, you have nothing to worry about, and nothing to do . Until such time as you open the system up to the outside world what is impemented on the system ( all ports closed by default ) nothing will get to the operating system .
[19:48] <michele_> http://xdcc_CANCEL_X1443117480
[19:48] <reisio> cute
[19:49] <SCHAAP137> that looks like a script failing
[19:49] <arooni> how do i bind a bash script to a particular hot key ?  (ubuntu 14.04)
[19:52] <SCHAAP137> quants_: just keep your packages and system up to date
[19:52] <SCHAAP137> it checks for updates automatically, it's easy
[19:54] <quants_> <Bashing-om> thanks for the information, can you tell me how to hide myself online, hide my ip address
[19:54] <quants_> <SCHAAP137> thanks
[19:55] <BadDream> hmmm such issues
[19:56] <akik> quants_: you can hide your ip address by not connecting anywhere :)
[19:56] <SCHAAP137> haha, true
[19:56] <akik> also tor, vpn
[19:56] <SCHAAP137> it's the network that makes the machine unsafe
[19:56] <surfer> whats the best way to consume DMT?
