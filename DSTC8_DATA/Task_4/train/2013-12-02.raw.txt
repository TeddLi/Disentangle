[14:34] <hassen> impradeepy, i see
[14:34] <gvo> hassen: sudo apt-get remove webcamstudio
[14:34] <hassen> so what doesn "apt-get" do? install and uninstall softwares?
[14:35] <gvo> Yes
[14:35] <hassen> i see.
[14:35] <k1l> hassen: apt-get ist the command behind the softwarecenter
[14:35] <gvo> man apt-get
[14:35] <hassen> k
[14:35] <hassen> k1l, i see
[14:38] <impradeepy> hassen, i will suggest you to install less 3rd party apps always try to find package in synaptic manager
[14:39] <hassen> impradeepy, lately being downloading and installing softwares exessively,and now i feel that i'm getting ubuntu unstable
[14:39] <hassen> moved recently from win7 :)
[14:39] <d0pzinger> hello
[14:39] <gvo> hassen: that's why impradeepy made the suggestion.
[14:40] <d0pzinger> does anyone of you know if it's ok to install ubuntu on a partition that already has some stuff on it?
[14:40] <d0pzinger> not windows though
[14:40] <impradeepy> hassen, then you should first read basic about linux
[14:40] <gvo> d0pzinger: not recommended.
[14:40] <BluesKaj> hassen. why , aren't you checking the package manager for the apps first
[14:40] <gvo> d0pzinger: Depending on what's there, it might work.
[14:40] <hassen> BluesKaj, package manager?
[14:41] <BluesKaj> ubuntu software center , hassen
[14:41] <impradeepy> hassen, google it give some time u ve just moved from windows do not be in hurry
[14:41] <ikonia> hassen: try reading https://help.ubuntu.com to learn the basics of how to use ubuntu
[14:42] <hassen> BluesKaj, ah yes,sure i do,but many other softwares that i want to install only exist within ubuntu forums and google code
[14:42] <hassen> e.g WebcamStudtio
[14:42] <impradeepy> hassen, ubuntu comes with complete package you just need to know about it so read it from ubuntu.com
[14:43] <xangua> hassen: why didn't you just add the getdeb repository for it then¿
[14:43] <hassen> so shouldn't I mess with softwares not beeing mentioned in in ubuntu center?
[14:43] <impradeepy> yes
[14:44] <impradeepy> be careful on system apps
[14:45] <hassen> thought i'mm find an app for streaming media over rtmp though,as i used to di in win7
[14:45] <hassen> *i'll*
[14:46] <impradeepy> open sources always has much and more softwares than windows
[14:46] <oshera> When someone gets the chance, could you help me format this flash drive and use Unetbootin/Gparted to put Kali Linux + Persistance? Keeps failing when I try, so I'll need help :P
[14:46] <impradeepy> format it with fat32
[14:47] <oshera> I thought I would want to format it ext4 ?
[14:48] <oshera> Unetbootin keeps giving a space error when it's a 4GB flash drive ..
[14:48] <impradeepy> oshera: use fdisk -l
[14:48] <impradeepy> then unmount ur drive
[14:49] <impradeepy> umount/dev/urflasdrive
[14:49] <oshera> One sec gotta re download again I accidently deleted the wrong one .. and kept the 23mb mini 64bit version
[14:49] <impradeepy> then mkfs.vat/dev/flasdrive
[14:49] <impradeepy> ok

[14:57] <axizor> hi, could someone please help me setup my samba server permissions? i'm not able to get write access and I don't know why
[14:57] <axizor> i made sure read only was a no in the .conf and set up a user account
[14:58] <axizor> my phone requires a login but no write access, win 8 requires no login and no write access
[14:58] <axizor> not sure what the problem is
[14:58] <impradeepy> axizor you want to share ur files?
[14:58] <axizor> yes
[14:58] <axizor> im only getting read only atm
[14:59] <impradeepy> form ubuntu to win8?
[14:59] <axizor> or any win version yes
[15:00] <axizor> when i was on ubuntu i didn't have a problem, switched to lubuntu and for some reason the sharing options were removed from the context menus from the folder so i had to do it through command line
[15:00] <axizor> maybe im doing something wrong, i dont know :\
[15:00] <impradeepy> well for windows settings lets open window dialogue not here
[15:00] <impradeepy> pm me
[15:01] <axizor> ok
[15:05] <shanahan> anyone one here use tmux a lot?
[15:05] <koyetsu> sorry no.
[15:05] <hydra7> someone please guide me to dual booting
[15:06] <mostly> !grub
[15:06] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
[15:06] <shanahan> basically my question is about why this keybinding won't work: http://i.stack.imgur.com/XWd5V.png    maybe it's the wrong command?   but "tmux" starts tmux in gnome-terminal..
[15:07] <zykotick9> shanahan: try #tmux
[15:08] <koyetsu> is there any reason that the nfs server daemon would cause dhcpd to stop working?
[15:08] <hydra7> anyone?
[15:08] <shanahan> hydra7,  running windows 7?
[15:09] <hydra7> yes shanahan
[15:09] <koyetsu> the isc-dhcp-server is running and i didn't change the config, but suddenly it isn't handing out ips
[15:10] <somsip> shanahan: what's the question?
[15:10] <Brandano> hydra7: as long as you install ubuntu after Windows 7 was already installed it should give you the option to dual boot right in the installer
[15:10] <koyetsu> hydra7 wants someone to walk him through a dual boot setup
[15:10] <shanahan> hydra7, download the latest 64 bit or 32 bit, whichever applies by googling: "download ubuntu"  you'll probably want the LTS.  so you'll get a file that is "ubuntu 12.04.1 amd .iso"   then google how to burn an ISO to a usb or disk, then boot from that disk or usb
[15:11] <shanahan> then select "install side by side "  or whatever.
[15:11] <hydra7> let's discuss in message shanahan
[15:11] <wingnut2626> I am trying to install a new version of ndiswrapper after a failed attempt from a previous version.   Here is what is happening after a make clean and a make : http://paste.ubuntu.com/6509668/
[15:11] <wingnut2626> any ideas?
[15:11] <shanahan> dude google it, there is a plethora of resources.  sorry i gtg hydra7
[15:12] <k1l> !dualboot | hydra7 see this howto and say where you have problems
[15:12] <ubottu> hydra7 see this howto and say where you have problems: Dual boot instructions: x86/AMD64: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DualBoot/Windows - Macs: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro https://help.ubuntu.com/community/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot
[15:12] <shanahan> but what i said is the general idea, find a program to burn ISO to usb.  like LiLi or...  uNetBootin
[15:13] <wingnut2626> i dont want to compile a new kernel i know theres an easier way
=== yourname is now known as jweez
[15:13] <hydra7> i am writing this message via live usb disk of Ubuntu 13.10
[15:13] <shanahan> o.O
[15:13] <koyetsu> honestly hydra if the directions you were offered don't make enough sense to you then you probably shouldn't dual boot. for users with lower levels of technical proficiency i recomend installing linux into a VM either by vmware player or virtualbox
[15:15] <hydra7> koyetsu i know most part of the dualboot but get stuck in the things like partitioning
[15:15] <xangua> wingnut2626: an easier way to what¿
[15:15] <hassen> anyway,the most of software i search for are gained by googling then downloading them from open source sites and linux forums,rather than finding them in ubuntu software center,which puts me in the situation i've mentioned gentlemen.
[15:16] <hydra7> http://imgur.com/SO3cAbT this is how i partitioned my disk
[15:16] <hydra7> in windows7
[15:16] <wingnut2626> to install ndiswrapper 1.59 after 1.57 failed and i attempted a
[15:16] <wingnut2626> 'make clean'
[15:16] <wingnut2626> http://paste.ubuntu.com/6509668/
[15:17] <jhutchins> I thought we had pretty much eliminated any real need for ndiswrapper...
[15:18] <Brandano> hydra7: you either let the installer to manage your partitions, or edit all partitions and mountpoints by hand, which requires a fair bit of knowledge of what each partition does. If you are not using an SSD, the first option is usually best
[15:18] <hassen> is launchpad an alternative place of free softwares of ubuntu center ?

[15:19] <MonkeyDust> hassen  https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/
[15:19] <hydra7> Brandano: what confuses me is the primary and logical partition
[15:19] <Brandano> hydra7: the installer should detect the unused space and propose it as destination, IIRC
[15:20] <Brandano> Windows needs to be installed on a primary partition. AFAIK Linux only needs the boot partition to be primary
[15:21] <Brandano> and the swap partition to be swap
[15:21] <Brandano> all the rest can be primary or extended, the important thing is that they should be mountable
[15:21] <hydra7> Brandano: clear me one thing. the max no. of primary partition we can have is 4
[15:21] <Brandano> yep. And Windows will only see the first, AFAIK
[15:22] <hydra7> does it mean both os can have 4/4 primary partition?
[15:22] <Brandano> nope
[15:22] <k1l> hydra7: 4 primary is a bios limitation. not a OS limitation
[15:22] <Brandano> the limit is due to the drive structure. You can only have 4 primary partitions on a device
[15:23] <hydra7> okay this hampers my planning then
[15:23] <geirha> It's a limitation of the msdos partition table
[15:23] <k1l> hydra7: just make some unused space to a extended one and put the ubuntu partitions in that extended one.
[15:23] <Mississauga> I installed a package, how to find the icon to run it?          sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install arduino arduino-core
[15:23] <k1l> ubuntu doesnt care if its on primarey or extended partitions.
[15:23] <hydra7> i thought of using 2 primary partitions in windows and other two for ubuntu
[15:23] <Brandano> or any linux distribution
[15:24] <gvo> Mississauga: Just type "arduino" on a command line.
[15:24] <Brandano> Well, that will work, but why?
[15:24] <hydra7> but seems windows has made two primary partitions already
[15:25] <bhavesh> Mississauga, or search for arduino in the dash
[15:25] <Brandano> The real spoilsport as far as partitions are concerned is Windows. Since it presumes to be the only os on the machine it has a pretty limited idea of what the allowable partitioning structure is
[15:25] <Mississauga> ok, works ty
[15:25] <hydra7> that system reserved ruined my planning :(
[15:25] <Brandano> hydra7: you don't need to have a primary partition for Ubuntu. It will run just fine in an extended
[15:26] <Brandano> that system reserved partition is your windows 7 recovery partition
[15:26] <Brandano> better leave it there
[15:26] <hydra7> that is the separate primary partition and will be counted by bios right?
[15:28] <Brandano> yes. But why would you need more primary partitions?
[15:28] <Brandano> there's no particular advantage to a primary partition
[15:28] <hydra7> okay
[15:29] <Brandano> except that the bios can access it to boot the system. But since you'd be going through the boot manager, that's not important
[15:29] <hydra7> Brandano can you tell me why there is 5mb unallocated space here http://imgur.com/SO3cAbT
[15:30]  * Brandano has 4 different Linux distributions installed on a laptop
[15:30] <Brandano> hydra7: rounding errors by the partition manager
[15:30] <hydra7> gparted or from windows
[15:31] <Brandano> it depends on the size of cylinders and sectors. For performance reasons the partition manager tends to align the edges to nice "round" numbers
[15:31] <Brandano> probably windows, though gparted also leaves space unallocated at times
[15:31] <lvleph> I would like to run calendar-indicator but I am not using unity. Normally I would just run the command and everything would be fine, but there doesn't seem to be an associated command for calendar-indicator. Anyone know what is run so this runs in unity?
[15:31] <Brandano> normally a few mb at most
[15:31] <hydra7> can't i just join two unallocated spaces
[15:32] <Brandano> Not worth it. Neither for the recovered space, nor for the time, nor for the risk of losing data
[15:32] <Brandano> any time you play with partitions there's a risk of data loss. Make sure you have your backups
[15:33] <hydra7> i have nothing to lose Brandano have my backups which have a size of mere 1 GB
[15:33] <lvleph> Okay, maybe someone can answer this. Where is the location of the power-indicator app
[15:34] <hydra7> something strange Brandano there's sda1,2,3 and 5 not 4 why?
[15:35] <axizor> do you guys know where the samba gui is located
[15:35] <Kruppt> hydra:leave the unallocated space after your two primary partitions alone
[15:36] <hydra7> left that already Kruppt :D
[15:36] <Brandano> I think the extended partition could be stretched to the end of the drive and logical partitions added?
[15:37] <Kruppt> hydra:because it was the first available primary available after the two primary partitions for the extended primary partition
[15:37] <hydra7> okay got it Brandano
[15:37] <hydra7> thanks everyone
[15:37] <Brandano> But really, I'd leave the installer to choose how to partition stuff
[15:38] <Brandano> you'll get to repartition everything by hand in a couple of years time anyway
[15:38] <lvleph> Is there a way to use power-indicator in a non-gnome WM?
[15:38] <hassen> is even getting free softwares from http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/  unrecommended?it's derectly related to ubuntu as ubuntu software center does
[15:38] <BluesKaj> Brandano. by making partitions logical they automaticlly become part of an extended partition IME,
[15:39] <Brandano> BluesKaj: yes, but the extended partition must be wide enough to contain them, right?
[15:39] <Brandano> IIRC one extended can contain many logical. And there's a relatively big large unallocated space there
[15:40] <Brandano> though I'd have espected the extended to contain one ntfs formatted partition
[15:40] <BluesKaj> Brandano. , it automatically includes the logical partitions yes , including swap
[15:41] <Brandano> I am referring to hydra7's setup, he posted a screenshot of gparted here: http://imgur.com/SO3cAbT
[15:42] <Brandano> if the extended is empty I'd either delete it, or stretch it to the end of the drive and create a smaller NTFS partition in it for the Windows7 OS to use

[16:01] <gvo> hydra7 to recap what others have said you can only have 4 prmary partitions.  Sounds like you're using all 4.
[16:02] <hydra7> gvo there are currently 2 primaries one extended which contained some data Brandano

[16:04] <Brandano> installing dual boot on a windows 7 machine with 100mb recovery(primary), win7os(primary), 299mbextended, 250mb unallocated
[16:05] <gvo> What I suggest it you create your three primary partitions, or in your case leave two alone and create a single primary.  Then add an extended partition to fill the rest of the space.  Then add secondary partitions to the extended as you wish.
[16:05] <gvo> At least that's what I'd do if it were my computer.  ;)
[16:05] <zykotick9> gvo: ahhh that 4 primary limit rule - applies to extended as well, so max would be 3 primary and 1 extended...
[16:06] <impradeepy> only 250MB unallocated and 299MB extended??
[16:06] <gvo> zykotick9: Yes, an extended partition is a primary partition.
[16:06] <gvo> However the extended partition can contain many secondary partitions.
[16:07] <zykotick9> gvo: sorry, upon re-reading your post, it makes sense.  sorry.

[16:09] <hydra7> right
[16:10] <impradeepy> hydra: how many drives you have on win?
[16:10] <gvo> hydra: why do you have a ntfs partition in the extended part?
[16:10] <hydra7> single
[16:10] <impradeepy> hydra: first shrink your volume make it two drive including C

[16:12] <gvo> I lost my win7 system that way.
[16:12] <impradeepy> hydra7: follow it i tested it my self
[16:12] <gvo> Couldn't even recover.
[16:12] <jhutchins> Of course we always make bacups before we mess with a partition table.
[16:12] <koyetsu> gvo that is why i always tell ppl to just use vm if they need to stick multi os on 1 box
[16:13] <impradeepy> gvo;why  no backup?

[16:15] <impradeepy> hydra7: do not worry just insert your installation media
[16:15] <gvo> hydra7: Do you expect to use it.
[16:15] <GeekGirlGabriell> so i tried

[16:16] <koyetsu> or=of
[16:16] <hydra7> gvo here's what i was planning 1 primary and 1logical for windows and same for ubuntu
[16:16] <Brandano> impradeepy: sorry if I butted in, it's just that you normally shrink to free up space, and this was not the problem here
[16:16] <impradeepy> hydra:7 boot from installation media
[16:16] <MonkeyDust> koyetsu  pxe, i failed to create it, how did you do it?
[16:16] <impradeepy> brandano: just wanna create two drives thats all
[16:17] <koyetsu> you have to do everything in a specific order. if you want i can walk you through it
[16:17] <gvo> GeekGirlGabriell: Also try chmod 1770
[16:17] <Brandano> yep. I suspect the installer sees the extended partition and tries to install there
[16:17] <hydra7> impradeepy: doing
[16:17] <impradeepy> select something else
[16:17] <GeekGirlGabriell> ok thanks gvo i'll try
[16:17] <hydra7> wait
[16:17] <MonkeyDust> koyetsu  can you put the walk through in a pastebin?
[16:18] <Brandano> What I would do is to stretch the extended (and the primary that contains it) to the whole drive. Then create a logical one in it for Windows, and install Ubuntu in the rest of the extended
[16:18] <gvo> GeekGirlGabriell: I also think you'll need to be root.
[16:18] <GeekGirlGabriell> i'm on the root terminal
[16:18] <hydra7> done impradeepy
[16:18] <impradeepy> click on unallocated space assign 50 or 70 gigs
[16:18] <koyetsu> i'm not to that point yet hehe, though i am planning on setting up a walkthrough and file structure tutorial when i've got it all figured out

[16:19] <impradeepy> hydra7: yes just for swapping
[16:19] <GeekGirlGabriell> i'm on a debian actually but i figured ubuntu user would  be able to help me :$
[16:19] <Brandano> Same thing
[16:19] <impradeepy> like you got system reserved on windows automatically

[16:28] <MonkeyDust> koyetsu  tnx
[16:28] <Chorca> maybe if i just link the 3.0 to 4.0

[16:37] <Brandano> xtalmath: I don't think Linux has a concept of a floppy as a special storage device. that's a Windows thing
[16:38] <zykotick9> xtalmath: ahh, ISO is not actually specified with that command...
[16:38] <gvo> TimR: use the mount command but first use the fdisk command to see what partitions might be there.
[16:38] <TimR> whats the mount command
[16:38] <xtalmath> Im just trying to follow James Molloy's mini kernel tutorial, and I need to give bochs a fake floppy

[16:40] <gvo> OerHeks: Good intro, thanks.
[16:40] <BluesKaj> TimR. once you know which drive , then, mount -o remount,rw /path/to/drive
[16:40] <TimR> well see im adding drives to owncloud
[16:41] <Brandano> Personally i prefer the partition info as presented by parted -l
[16:41] <gvo> BluesKaj: I suspect if he didn't know what a mount was, it's a stretch to think he might know how to translate the output of fdisk to /path/to/drive.  Just sayin'
[16:42] <gvo> Brandano: Except parted sometimes can't figure out disk configurations when fdisk can/
[16:42]  * hassen has begin getting errors and stuff at ubuntu's startup,so from now on,he won't get third party packages from ubuntu forums and open source sites
[16:42] <TimR> gvo you dont need to be rude
[16:42] <zykotick9> Brandano: plus parted supports GPT ;)
[16:43] <hassen> *begun*
[16:43] <TimR> I know what mount is
[16:43] <BluesKaj> gvo. seems simple enough to me mount -o remount,rw /dev/sdX
[16:43] <gvo> timr Sorry didn't mean to be rude.
[16:43] <TimR> I just really never mounted an other hard drive to the system
[16:43] <gvo> OK my mistake.
[16:43] <TimR> i just dont want to redo the server with the new hard drive
[16:44] <Brandano> TimR: man fstab too
[16:44] <DonkeyHotei> nobody?
[16:44] <gvo> I took your response to mean you didn't know what a mount command is,  I see you meant what's the specific command.
[16:44] <rhumbot> hi all, i am looking for a solution to synchronize an ubuntu calender with my android phone ... ?
[16:44] <TimR> that is correct gvo
[16:44] <ddssc> when including migration files in version commits, which files should be included? all of them? without initial.py?
[16:44] <ddssc> south migrations btw
[16:45] <Brandano> TimR: are you mirroring the drive to a new one?
[16:46] <DonkeyHotei> rhumbot: google calendar should do it automagically
[16:46] <TimR> from what I was told from owncloud forum is that I can just add hard drives to add for more space
[16:47] <Brandano> oh, yes. But you either find them mounted in /media/<mountpoint>, or you have to alter the way your partitions are mounted in fstab
=== GTB3NW_AWAY is now known as GTB3NW
[16:47] <Brandano> and in the second case it gets a whole level more complex
[16:47] <Brandano> though it's the most "unixy" way to do things
[16:48] <Brandano> TimR: where do you need that space?
[16:48] <TimR> http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/admin_manual/configuration/custom_mount_config_gui.html
[16:48] <aarontc> anyone know how to get ubuntu server to install using GPT instead of MBR on a non-EFI machine?
[16:48] <TimR> see I already have 160gig hard drive and want to add couple more hard drives like 3 1tb hard drives
[16:49] <TimR> which that 160 gig hard drive have the server and owncloud installed on
[16:49] <Brandano> yep. If it's just to store data, just mount them in their mountpoint in /media/
[16:50] <wavedigit> hi I couldn't find anything on google about this - I added a user with adduser as root, filled everything in as I was supposed to do and now I want to su to that new user using my unprivileged account (using sudo). Strangely though it doesn't switch user, the prompt just stays the same and whoami tells me that I'm not the new user.
[16:50] <TimR> so whats that command to due that Brandano if I may ask
[16:50] <zykotick9> aarontc: does the ubuntu server install, offer an "expert" mode?  that was the only was i was able to do it on debian...  i'm guessing ubuntu might not offer that feature - but only a guess.  good luck.
[16:50] <wavedigit> I also did this using root but got the same results. Does this have to do anything with SELinux? I'm running Linux version 3.8.0-33-generic (buildd@toyol) (gcc version 4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) ) #48~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 24 16:28:06 UTC 2013
[16:50] <zykotick9> s/was i/way i/
[16:50] <aarontc> zykotick9: it might, but I don't know how to get there if it does :) thanks
[16:51] <DonkeyHotei> i have a problem. i want a machine to run headless, but it won't boot unless i have a display attached, freezes enumerating physical memory map, running LTS
[16:51] <wavedigit> also I tried doing sudo -i -u newusername but that didn't work as well
=== dziegler is now known as dziegler_off
[16:51] <Brandano> if it's to extend stuff like adding more space to /usr/share/, then you either symlink stuff from the mountpoint in /media/, or replace the /usr/share/ with your new drive specifying it in fstab. but for the moment, just create a mountpoint in /media/ and mount there
[16:51] <TimR> alright thanks brandano
[16:52] <Brandano> TimR: for mount options better check man for the specific filetype
[16:53] <Brandano> TimR: err, for the specific filesystem, sorry

[16:56] <Dudytz> hi all! how is the right place to configure the dnsmasq "fallback" dns server in a dhcp connection? (I am using ubuntu 13.10 + network manager + dnsmasqd)
[16:57] <Brandano> Kijutsu: try just running an apt-get install --reinstall ircd-hybrid ? not sure it will fix things, but shouldn't hurt
[16:57] <aarontc> Dudytz: the normal DHCP protocol specifies a list of DNS servers, I don't know if there is a special option you can add to mark one as a "fallback" -- most DNS resolvers will use servers in round-robin fashion
[16:58] <Dudytz> ok, but I want to configure the google dns in replace of the dns server provided by the dhcp connection
[16:58] <Dudytz> without dnsmasq I utilize the dhcp.conf ... but in this case I have dnsmasq in middle
[16:58] <Brandano> Dudytz: I set it up on the router
[16:59] <Kijutsu> Brandano: already nuked a stale pid file there
[16:59] <aarontc> Dudytz: are you trying to configure an override on the client, rather than changing the server itself?
[16:59] <Dudytz> dhcp.conf has an option to "prepend dns server"
[16:59] <Dudytz> but I do not change the server, I have access only to the client
[17:00] <munz> Dudytz: network settings > select your if > click options > ipv4 tab > set to dhcp address only
[17:00] <Brandano> If the client fails to grab the DNS server from DHCP it probably failed the rest of the network configuration too
[17:00] <munz> then set your netmask gateway dns etc
[17:00] <Dudytz>  this setting is right for the dnsmasq too?
[17:01] <munz> *should*
[17:01] <Brandano> Dudytz: what is dnsmasq doing in this case, just acting as caching dns server? Or is it the DHCP server for the network?
[17:01] <Dudytz> better: dnsmasq get the server dns from this setting (if is setted)?
[17:01] <Dudytz> yes
[17:01] <Dudytz> caching server
=== Scrash is now known as Skyrax
[17:01] <Dudytz> only caching (and have a dev tld)
[17:01] <Dudytz> (no dhcp server)
[17:02] <Brandano> then leave it as it is, assuming it works, and alter the DHCP server to provide the google dns servers as fallback
[17:02] <Skyrax> Hello, i need one person that can speak spanish
[17:02] <Dudytz> great!
[17:02] <Brandano> the dhcp server being your router
[17:02] <Dudytz> with dig I can see that the google dns is the fallback server?
[17:02] <Brandano> well, it's "one of the servers"
[17:03] <Brandano> though you could consider it fallback since the machine will latch on the first to reply

[17:04] <Brandano> Dudytz: this is assuming you have control over your LAN. Otherwise yes, you'll have to play with the local dnsmasq settings I guess

[17:15] <lass> I need to add an additional user to my pc for someone else to work but I want the newuser to have less priviledge than me. Is it possible to restrict admin right of the new user?
[17:16] <gordonjcp> lass: yes, don't put them in the sudoers group
[17:16] <gordonjcp> lass: which is I believe the default
[17:16] <lass> gordonjcp, is it standard user?
[17:16] <Brandano> Balzy: won't it be enough to add it to the skel directory that is used to create user profiles?
[17:17] <lass> I want the user to be able to install program (sudo apt-get install ..)
[17:17] <Brandano> lass: add it to the sudoers group
[17:18] <Brandano> lass: Hmm, if he can install stuff he can't have fewer privileges than you
[17:18] <Brandano> best you can do is either run him in a virtual machine or in a chroot

=== pako is now known as Guest14472
[17:19] <Enigma_> not taking it i meant
[17:20] <lass> Brandano, basically I don,t want the guy to access to a hardrive can I add a protection like when someone needs to mount it, he needs to enter a password?
[17:20] <lass> the password that I set for it
[17:21] <fishcooker> how to test ssd drive
[17:21] <Brandano> you can encrypt it so that only your profile can mount it
[17:21] <lass> can you hint me what tool/command should I look at?
[17:21] <Brandano> I am fairly happy with truecrypt, but there's inbuilt tools as well, i think?
[17:22] <lass> Brandano, I will look at it, thank you
[17:22] <Brandano> But really, encryption is the only way you can safely restrict access to files from someone with root privileges
[17:23] <Brandano> unless he installs a keylogger
[17:23] <Brandano> then you are back to square one
[17:24] <Rory> Brandano: Boot-time full-disk encryption
[17:24] <Rory> Brandano: However that won't protect against hardware keyloggers
[17:24] <Brandano> but then you can't give access to the other user at root level
[17:24] <Brandano> which is what lass was asking
[17:24] <lass> Brandano, I installed ubuntu via wubi, the harddisk that I would encrypt is the part where windows 7 installed. do you know if windows 7 would have trouble to boot/access any file in case I encrypt that harddrive via truencrypt,
[17:25] <Brandano> yes, it definitely would
[17:25] <Brandano> you'd need to have windows 7 set up to boot from full disk encryption before even installing ubuntu
[17:26] <Brandano> and I am not sure you even can have full disk encryption and the boot manager living along each other
[17:26] <lass> I see, I guess the best is to backup files then delete them
[17:26] <lass> thanks for the help
[17:28] <Brandano> Well, the situation you describe is a bit hard to find a solution for. And even with the machine as it is, an user could boot it from a liveusb and read its entire content, if it's not already encrypted
[17:28] <Brandano> the windows password is a joke of a protection
[17:29] <Brandano> so is PAM, if it's not backed up by encryption at least of the home folder

[17:31] <bjrohan> Hey everyone. Ihad the good fortune of picking up a new A/V receiver over the weekend that is DLNA capable with wifi. I am looking to stream my mp3 from an ubuntu system to the receiver over the network, any suggestions? I tried XBMC, however it doesn't allow me to access all the mp3's from the receiver, nor playlists.

[17:31] <Teleport> hi, how can I change midi maps, ex. change a bang button to a toggle one
[17:32] <Teleport> ?
[17:32] <impradeepy> bye @ all
[17:32] <lass> wubi is very nice but it allows to access all the window's file
[17:32] <impradeepy> lass: use seperate partitions
[17:33] <jhutchins> lass: Sudo can be used to restrict which root-privileges a user can use via the name of the command, but you have to trust them not to deliberately try to hack the system.
[17:33] <lass> in that case, I need to install ubuntu again, right?
[17:33] <Brandano> impradeepy: that won't stop the other user from mounting the windows partitions to read them, though
[17:33] <jhutchins> lass: Linux can read and write NTFS partitions.
[17:34] <impradeepy> can later change in privacy settings
[17:34] <jhutchins> lass: NTFS being what Windows uses.
[17:34] <Brandano> if the other user is malicious he will find a way
[17:34] <Brandano> then again, I am paranoid
[17:34] <lass> sure
[17:34] <impradeepy> but windows cant read/write ext4
[17:34] <jhutchins> impradeepy: It can, but it takse some work and some extra software.
[17:34] <Brandano> impradeepy: actually, it can, but baddly, and with 3rd party drivers
[17:34] <hydra7> impradeepy: check pm
[17:35] <impradeepy> i will never suggest you to try 3rd party apps
[17:35] <saliak> I have dhcpd on a linux server running shore wall as my firewall/dhcp server.  I want to be able to access services on my firewall with my WAN dyndns name (rather than having to use IP address in my subnet)  how to I make everything on my local network resolve my dyndns domain to my server local ip rather than trying to come in through my wan IP (through normal DNS resolution)?
[17:35] <lass> I don,t think the guy will work on my laptop will try to hack my files but I just want to leave them open access
[17:35] <Brandano> only reads it as ext2, so no journaling
[17:35] <Teleport> hi, how can I change midi maps, ex. change a bang button to a toggle one
[17:35] <impradeepy> for general windows user its impossible to do that
[17:35] <jhutchins> saliak: Run an internal DNS server that resolves those names to local hosts.
[17:36] <jhutchins> saliak: Or just put them in your /etc/hosts file.
[17:36] <impradeepy> without much knowledge of file systems
[17:36] <Brandano> saliak: you don't. You only NAT those services that must be published to the web, and access the rest either via VPN or SSH tunnel
[17:37] <impradeepy> brandano: can you tell me how will he get root priveldge
[17:37] <impradeepy> ??
[17:37] <impradeepy> as to access ext4
[17:37] <Brandano> impradeepy: for starters lass wants him to be able to install software
[17:37] <jhutchins> lass: While it's not easy to do it within an NTFS system (assuming you stick with wubi), you can encrypt a partition so that it will require a password to mount/access/read the partition.
[17:37] <Brandano> impradeepy: on ubuntu, not on windows
[17:37] <Brandano> the new user is an ubuntu user
[17:38] <jhutchins> lass: I believe it's difficult to do with data already on the partition, the usual setup is to encrypt the blank partition, then copy the data.
[17:38] <saliak> Brandano: hrm.. so my issue is that shore wall won't let me access my service locally when I use my dyndns name that resolves to the WAN IP.
[17:38] <saliak> Brandano: this has always confused me
[17:38] <Brandano> saliak: your router is forwarding the ports to your machine?
[17:38] <impradeepy> brandano:thats two diffrent topics b
[17:38] <lass> jhutchins, I can do that, thanks for the suggestion
[17:39] <lass> I need to boot my laptop to boring windows
[17:39] <lass> thanks for the advices
[17:39] <Brandano> saliak: assuming your machine is answering to queries from LAN, btw
[17:39] <saliak> Brandano: my router is my server.  i'm running asterisk on it as well.  trying to get phones to just use the dns name, rather than my local ip hone they're in my local network
[17:39] <saliak> Brandano: yes
[17:39] <Brandano> so the modem is controlled directly from your server?
[17:40] <jhutchins> saliak: Did you see my earlier response?
[17:40] <wheatthin> saliak, can you connect using the external ip of your dns server?
[17:41] <saliak> jhutchins: there's no hosts file for my phone.
[17:41] <wheatthin> saliak, the only way is to create your own internal dns
[17:41] <icewalker> can surface pro 2 works with ubuntu like the old surface pro model?
[17:42] <Brandano> oh, got it. wheatthin is right
[17:42] <OerHeks> icewalker, i read issues with network adapters, so try your model in live mode
[17:42] <Brandano> because you will need to resolve your ip differently when on the LAN than when on the WAN
[17:43] <wheatthin> I had to do the same on my hackintosh :)
[17:43] <Brandano> essentially you need your dns server to resolve your domain and forward all other requests
[17:43] <icewalker> i want to make sure it works before i buy  surface pro 2
[17:43] <OerHeks> icewalker, one way to find out
[17:43] <wheatthin> icewalker, then you must lookup the different chipsets, I'm sure it's supported
[17:43] <Brandano> Well, I did the same but on OpenWRT, since the router is a SOHO dsl router
[17:44] <icewalker> i find articles on installing ubuntu on surface pro but nothing on surface pro 2
[17:44] <wheatthin> Brandano, not the same I"m afraid. Your openwrt router is only forwarding packets from the router itself. Unless you have bind running, it won't be the same
[17:45] <Brandano> I have dnsmasq running on it
[17:45] <Brandano> and bind
[17:45] <wheatthin> and did you setup bind for internal dns records?
[17:45] <ciccio> irc://irc.oltreirc.net/puffolandia
[17:45] <icewalker> don't want take a chance if no one able to get surface pro2 so i might just have to buy the older model.
[17:46] <rwc2> hi, i think i might have a partial incomplete install or setup for my ati/amd proprietary driver downloaded from ati/amd website.  i'd like to simply revert back to default kubuntu 13.10 driver.  how easy is this
[17:46] <wheatthin> icewalker, go lookup the chipsets man. Most likely it's supported as it doesn't use state of the art graphics. The thing I'd make sure to check up on, is the wifi
[17:46] <icewalker> ok
[17:49] <Brandano> wheatthin: I set it up so that any machine on the lan will both resolve to <machinename> and <machinename>.<localdomain>, except for those services I explicitly forward to some machines, like http that points to a machine alias
[17:49] <Brandano> but using the openwrt interfaces, so I am not comlpetely sure of how the innards do work. The machine registers its hostname via dhcp
[17:50] <Brandano> but I didn't set things up so that I could redirect subdomains to a dmz, I have no need for it yet. It is possible, though
[17:50] <wheatthin> Brandano, and does it resolve with nslookup?
[17:50] <Brandano> from the lan, sure. From the wan, nope. Only www and mail do
[17:51] <Brandano> and the domain, obviously
[17:51] <Brandano> internally the dns acts as a dns server
[17:52] <wheatthin> Brandano, then your external dns must have a wildcard
[17:52] <Brandano> www is registered and handled by a dns provider. mail has its mx record, and that's it
[17:53] <Brandano> to resolve other subdomains I'd have to take over the record and assign it to another registrar. I'll probably do it too
[17:53] <wheatthin> Brandano, yes, but it must be setup to use *.domain.com for example
[17:53] <Brandano> not right now. But it could, and then it would be up to the router to handle it
[17:54] <wheatthin> no, it'll forward the request to your router-to your internal dns server, then it gets resolved.
[17:54] <vooze> Hey, I just rebooted my Ubuntu 13.10 and after my HDMI monitor (connected to laptop) just stopped working (I've screen and the screen is fine, it works with other computers.. also running ubuntu) What could I have done wrong? Its not in the monitor options :/
[17:54] <Brandano> exactly
[17:55] <wheatthin> which is how it works, then you setup individual domains in apache for all the different web subdomains
[17:55] <wheatthin> but it each alias also must be in dns configs
[17:55] <Brandano> if you need them for the web. Or reroute to separate machines
[17:55] <wheatthin> Brandano, negative, I had to do the same thing.
[17:56] <wheatthin> as my router/modem combo doesn't allow me to connect to my external IP
[17:56] <wheatthin> it must be setup to use internal only
[17:56] <Brandano> you can also use namebased virtual hosts and have different domains for the same static ip or ip pool
[17:57] <Brandano> wheatthin: have a look at OpenWRT. For small setups is pretty nifty
[17:57] <rwc2> hi, i think i might have a partial incomplete install or setup for my ati/amd proprietary driver downloaded from ati/amd website.  i'd like to simply revert back to default kubuntu 13.10 driver.  how easy is this
[17:57] <wheatthin> bind is bind basically :)
[17:58] <wheatthin> rwc2, did it fail during installation? if not try sudo aticonfig --initial
[17:58] <Brandano> yep. but having bind, dnsmasq, iptables and the like on an appliance is neat
[17:58] <saliak> wheatthin: ok, that's what I thought.. i was hoping there was a simpler option
[17:58] <wheatthin> Brandano, I hear you, which is why I have osx server :P, but that's not for here, but bind is bind
[17:59] <rwc2> wheatthin, no, it didn't fail, seemed ok.  but kubuntu says its not activated.  i think i'd like to just use the default kubuntu driver, but dont have the installation disk around
[17:59] <saliak> Another question, anyone had luck with a way to repeat multicast packets (from iTunes home sharing primarily) from one adapter to a VPN?
[18:00] <Brandano> rwc2: did you try to activate it?
[18:00] <wheatthin> rwc2, then i'd suggest trying  sudo aticonfig --initial  and have another go
[18:00] <diceboy321> wazzup
[18:00] <diceboy321> xubuntu is best
[18:01] <wheatthin> all of ubuntu is nice, nothing is more or less better, just more or less suitable.
[18:01] <diceboy321> its my opinion
[18:01] <wheatthin> well keep it to yourself :) unless you are helping someone
[18:02] <rwc2> how do i load 'Additional Drivers' dialog as sudo?  no luck as user
[18:02] <wheatthin> rwc2, you do that command in the console/terminal
[18:02] <rwc2> wheatthin, what is the commnad
[18:02] <Brandano> gottago, bye all
[18:02] <wheatthin> rwc2, for the fourth time   sudo aticonfig --initial
[18:03] <wheatthin> rwc2, then   sudo service lightdm restart

[18:05] <bekks> linuxuz3r: In the source repos in your repo lists. To install them, change to a work directory, and run apt-get source packagename
[18:06] <diceboy321> reinstall your ubuntu
[18:06] <rwc2> diceboy321, only way huh
[18:06] <diceboy321> no
[18:06] <rwc2> only easy way?
[18:06] <diceboy321> idk other ways ask som experts
[18:06] <bekks> rwc2: Just uninstall the drivers in question.
[18:06] <wheatthin> rwc2, yes there is. lol

[18:11] <wheatthin> well then you have your answer. What do you have starting? dmesg will show.
[18:11] <jhutchins> diceboy321: Compared to what?
[18:12] <diceboy321> ?
[18:13] <wheatthin> the answer is repair boot will not help. lol You must see which init process is taking up too much time to load during boot.

[18:59] <zerowaitstate> designbybeck: on 13.10, dnsmasq has its cache-size set to zero, so it never caches
[19:00] <zerowaitstate> designbybeck: dnsmasq is a dns resolver that listens on 127.0.0.1, which is what your /etc/resolv.conf is pointed to, if you noticed

[19:50] <urielvigilant> IS a friend of mine laptop.
[19:52] <urielvigilant> where said can please read cant . typing mistake
[19:52] <BluesKaj> urielvigilant. if the usb doesn't work try a dvd
[19:52] <sagotsky> Hawkerz, did I miss any logs?
[19:53] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, no, you have a problem with the gnome power manager
[19:53] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, which release are you using?
[19:53] <sagotsky> 13.10
[19:53] <Hawkerz> when did you upgrade?
[19:53] <sagotsky> about a week after it came out
[19:53] <urielvigilant> BluesKaj do you think it could be about trying in Usb ? so that mean a full instal could work even with usb ?
[19:54] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, which window manager/desktop env do you use?
[19:54] <sagotsky> xmonad
[19:55] <parapan> hi fellows > networking problem ...cannot access 192.168.0.1 the router config page via LAN cable; it's working on the wireless but not within the LAN . . ..
[19:56] <BluesKaj> urielvigilant. sometimes usb installs have problems that cd or dvds don't have ...usbs are buggier
=== AEM` is now known as aem`
[19:57] <urielvigilant> BluesKAj: that means usb could work very well on my laptop or on another desktop , but could fail on another laptop ?

[19:58] <marko-_-> hello. How would i say mail from my gmail account from terminal? I followed 3 tutorials and none work
[19:58] <marko-_-> s/say/mail
[19:59] <ResQue> how can i install hwinfo? i tried apt-get install hwinfo but it says no such package
[19:59] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, are you trying to run xmonad in a gnome session?
[20:00] <sagotsky> no, I have a separate sessoin file somewhere that runs my .xsession
[20:00] <parapan> hi fellows > networking problem ...cannot access 192.168.0.1 the router config page via LAN cable; it's working on the wireless but not within the LAN . . ..
[20:00] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, ok, it seems like it's a gtk2 bug from looking at it... do you have the multiarch libs for gtk2 installed?
[20:01] <sagotsky> on this machine I can't remember
[20:02] <sagotsky> I have libgtk2.0-0:i386
[20:02] <sagotsky> all my other installed gtk packages either don't specify an arch or are amd64
[20:03] <sagotsky> nom
[20:03] <sagotsky> doh
[20:03] <stijndg> ResQue, i cannot install that one either but i use Sysinfo wich works fine as well
[20:04] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, is your laptop a nvidia optimus laptop?
[20:04] <glitsj16> ResQue: hwinfo is no longer in the 13.10 repos, i assume you're running that version of ubuntu?
[20:04] <ResQue> stijndg: thanks i will try that, it seems its been removed. whats the best way to check framebuffer info so i can config grub?
[20:05] <sagotsky> Hawkerz, not positive.  I have a dell e6420.  Some of them have optimus, but I can't tell if it's universal.  (It's owned by work so I haven't paid its hardware too much attention)
=== krankokat_ is now known as krankokat
[20:06] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, you have an optimus configuration, it's the same machine I'm on and you have the same proprietary video card
[20:06] <Hawkerz> drivers, rather
[20:06] <sagotsky> ah, cool
[20:06] <glitsj16> ResQue: either install hwinfo (and libhal1 + libhd16 dependencies) from raring --> via packages.ubuntu.com .. or get to a grub prompt at boot and use the vbeinfo command to get framebuffer availability
[20:07] <sagotsky> I'm using standard nvidia drivers from apt.  I didn't do any of the optimus specific stuff
[20:07] <ResQue> glitsj16: i will use vbeinfo thanks
[20:07] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, (npviewer.bin:3874): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "murrine",
[20:08] <glitsj16> ResQue: many guides still refer to hwinfgo .. too bad it's no longer there, but vbeinfo still gives you the same info, yw
[20:08] <Hawkerz> ^ This is known to cause errors with gtk when you are not using gnome, having gtk searching for a theme where it can't locate one seems to cause some weird segfault
[20:08] <ResQue> glitsj16: thanks for the headsup
[20:08] <parapan> hi fellows > networking problem ...cannot access 192.168.0.1 the router config page via LAN cable; it's working on the wireless but not within the LAN . . ..
[20:09] <sagotsky> And you think that'll affect my mouse and keyboard?
[20:09] <Ilmen> Hello
[20:09] <Hawkerz> probably, since it's segfaulting the gnome power management daemon (are you manually killing gnome in your xsession file?)
[20:10] <sagotsky> not killing it, but not starting it up either
[20:10] <sagotsky> what starts the power management daemon?  gnome-settings-daemon?
[20:13] <Ilmen> I just installed Ubuntu 13.10 on a UEFI computer with pre-installed Windows 8; apparently Ubuntu has been installed in Legacy mode, and Win8 is no longer bootable, so I downloaded boot-repair. It's asking me "The boot of your PC is in Legacy mode. You may want to retry after changing it to EFI mode. Do you want to continue?"
[20:13] <Ilmen> Do you think I can safely continue?
[20:13] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, [   28.020410] init: gdm main process (1248) killed by TERM signal
[20:14] <sagotsky> Hawkerz, that was probably me restarting X without waiting for the whole system to restart
[20:14] <sagotsky> It's not doing that automatically as far as I'm aware
[20:15] <sagotsky> I wanted to see if some settings changes let me type in the login manager or not
[20:15] <Hawkerz> ok, and you are using usb keyboard an mouse? or trying to I guess?
[20:16] <sagotsky> correct
[20:17] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, do your USB ports work when you plug other stuff into them?

[20:23] <nsql>  llutz, if I do ls /home/user, I can see all my files. I don,t know what I did wrong. what I did is to run 'chmod 750 $HOME' on the terminal,
[20:23] <nsql> llutz, ls -al shows 'drwxr-x---' for the other accounts home directory
[20:23] <llutz> nsql: you are "user"? sure you can see your own home then
[20:24] <jhutchins> nsql: In order for you to see your own home directory, you need to be able to see the directories in /home/.  You should not be able to read the other users's directory or it's subdirectories.
[20:25] <llutz> nsql: 'drwxr-x---' is 750. what are you trying to achieve?

[20:28] <nsql> lltuzö jhutchins: let me try to explain it again, maybe I use wrong terminology. I have a user, say user1 and created a new user account called user2. on user1's command prompt I run 'chmod 750 $HOME' then logout and log in to user2. on user2's command prompt, when I run 'ls /home/user1' I can see the all directories, like /home/user1/Desktop and sub folders
[20:29] <nsql> how can I prevent user2 to see any file, subdirectories under /home/user1 ?
[20:29] <llutz> nsql: you shouldn't see the contents. what group owns /home/user1? and is user2 member of that group?
[20:30] <Kartagis> nsql: chmod 700 /home/user1
[20:30] <nsql> they are both administrative accounts
[20:30] <nsql> I will try 700 now
[20:31] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, can you show me your xmonad/xsession configs?
[20:31] <llutz> nsql: "ls -ld /home/user1   && id user2"

[20:32] <knight221> Hello, Can someone recommand me on good code revision control for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS which have aslo windows clients?
[20:33] <sagotsky> Hawkerz, http://paste.ubuntu.com/6511103/ that's xmonad, then .xsession, then ls from my .xsession.d.
[20:33] <sagotsky> anything interesting in .xsession.d can be found in https://github.com/sagotsky/.dotfiles/tree/master/scripts
[20:34] <sagotsky> I am deliberately killing notification-daemon and notify-osd.  Not sure if that could be related to the power manager segfaulting?
[20:34] <rypervenche> knight221: git
[20:34] <sagotsky> (I've been doing that for quite a while, so I don't think that's it, but it couldn't hurt to mention)
[20:34] <renebarbosa> hey folks

[20:36] <renebarbosa> k1l, okay
[20:36] <jhutchins> nsql: The "execute" flag on a directory determines whether the directory listing can be read.  If a user is a member of a group that has x permissions then that user can list the contents.
[20:37] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, https://gist.github.com/minhajuddin/2156485 <- this is an example I found (I don't really use xmonad, but I looked around a bit)
[20:37] <jhutchins> nsql: Since there is no such thing as an "administrative account" in *nix, I'm presuming that you mean that they are in a group that has some special privileges.
[20:37] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, it looks like you need to manually ensure that gnome-keyring-daemon, gnome-settings-daemon, and gnome-power-manager are all running (see the first file on that page)
[20:38] <knight221> Does someone know if Ubuntu 10.04 LTS have a package for Perfoce server (https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/perforce-version-management/)? if not does it possible to install it from the 12.04-13.10 package?
[20:39] <sagotsky> Hawkerz, happy to give it a try.  I don't have a gnome-power-manager bin though.  Just reinstalled from apt.
[20:40] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, the long and short of it though, is that power management, GSD, and gtk are not getting loaded
[20:40] <Hawkerz> well, I'm not really sure if there is an equivalent or whatever
[20:41] <sagotsky> That definitely gives me some stuff to try.  I'll see if I can figure out what replaces gnome-power-manager.  No change just running gnome-settings-daemon.
[20:41] <kingplusplus> please how do know which partition my os is installed /dev/sb1 or 2
[20:41] <sagotsky> Hawkerz, that was some fantastic support even if we didn't get to the bottom of it today.  I really appreciate it.
[20:43] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, sure thing, there are a lot of random things being reported, but i mostly think it's power management
[20:43] <Hawkerz> that was my first instinct
[20:43] <Hawkerz> and googling seems to reaffirm it a bit anyway
=== xubuntu is now known as Guest49079
[20:43] <sagotsky> Cool
[20:44] <sagotsky> That's dfeinitely something I can keep googling.  I don't often use this machine as a laptop so I haven't paid as much attention to power services as I should.
[20:45] <Hawkerz> meh, power management sucks....I only ever get it to break things
[20:45] <sagotsky> Heh
[20:45] <kingplusplus> hello how can i delete stuff in my root?
[20:46] <goose_> quit
[20:46] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, the gist of what I saw online was that it could be any number of things from power management to graphics drivers to missing gtk2 libraries
[20:47] <Hawkerz> evidently, 13.10 still has several known issues...have you used Mir at all?
[20:47] <sagotsky> Interesting.  I was assuming it was something lower level than gtk2 since it was failing before I even got to X.
[20:47] <sagotsky> Haven't tried it
[20:47] <Hawkerz> oh, so you are trying to move away from gdm to x?
[20:48] <sagotsky> I don't mind the login manager, I was just trying to rule out whether it was an xorg config problem
[20:48] <mikodo> kingplusplus, in terminal <df -h>
[20:48] <sagotsky> Not being able to type in ctrl-alt-f1 led me to believe the problem was happening outside of x
[20:48] <Hawkerz> well, if you switched login managers that could easily be the cause
[20:48] <sagotsky> haven't recently
[20:49] <sagotsky> just restarted it a few times for debugging
[20:49] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, but you were using GDM at some point and now you are not?
[20:49] <sagotsky> I'm on lightdm right now
[20:49] <Hawkerz> oh
[20:49] <sagotsky> I think that's the default
[20:49] <sagotsky> Not something I have strong opinions about so I don't pay it much attention
[20:49] <Hawkerz> yes, it is...that's the important thing here
[20:50] <sagotsky> ok
[20:51] <Hawkerz> the login manager, if misconfigured, can break everything....
[20:51] <sagotsky> it looks like I tried to tell it to autologin at some point
[20:51] <sagotsky> my name is in there
[20:51] <Hawkerz> it's only the USB keyboard that doesn't work, right? you can still ctrl+alt+f1 from the native keyboard?
[20:51] <sagotsky> but I don't think that's ever worked
[20:51] <sagotsky> correct

[20:52] <sagotsky> Hawkerz, the native keyboard works fine.  I haven't found anything it does wrong.  gnome-settings-daemon sometimes eats my xmodmap settings, but that's another matter.

[21:15] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, as a final point, I don't actually think it's a problem with GTK, but I do think it is a problem with power management...still, hard to say
=== Ajar is now known as Ajarm
[21:16] <sagotsky> I think I agree.  I've had no noticeable errors from gtk - errors aside, everything runs smoothly and looks purty.  But there's a ton of power management stuff that doesn't work.  Like rebooting.
[21:17] <juboba> how can I upgrade from 12.04 to 13.04 or 13.10? I'm running "update-manager -d" and it is offering 14.04.
[21:17] <Sian> apt-get install ffmpeg asks me to install nvidia drivers when I do not own a nvidia card(obviously isntalling them means crashing at reboot), what can I do?some of the packages have xedgers in the name that most likely come from the zord-edgers ppa, but I already purged it, I even re-added it to purge it again but those packages keep appearing
[21:18] <k1l> jubba: you need to update to 12.10 first.
=== peter is now known as Guest80479
[21:18] <k1l> jubba: set the release prompt to regular (from LTS). then it should say 12.10 for "update-manager"
[21:18] <aebonyne> How do I get my computer to not shutdown when pressing the power button (I'd like it to either ask or sleep/hibernate)? Computer is a Surface Pro if it matters. I've disabled the settings to shutdown on power button press in the Gnome and XFCE power managers as well as in /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh, which is as far as Googling the topic got me.
[21:18] <juboba> k1l, how should I proceed?
[21:19] <aebonyne> Sian: Installing drivers for hardware you don't have shouldn't cause problems...
[21:19] <juboba> k1l, how do I change the release prompt?
[21:19] <k1l> juboba: go to the systemsettings and then to updates and sources. then set the updates to regulear (3rd tab iirc)
[21:19] <shanahan> are there any good alternatives to 'jockey-gtk'?  or the additional drivers window?  mine's a bit glitchy.
[21:19] <Sian> aebonyne, but 1, it does, as it crashes my system at reboot. and 2, I have a 80GB hdd, I don't want to install more than necesary

=== krankokat is now known as baordog_
[21:21] <shanahan> woha
[21:21] <Sian> not only that, but the other packages of the ppa aren't shown by my system, so nvidia drivers seem to be the only packages from there that are actually showing. NO idea why
[21:21] <aebonyne> Sian: Saving space is a good reason. In general, you can avoid installing packages by postfixing their name with a minus sign in the apt-get install command: apt-get install ffmpeg nvidia-glx-
[21:21] <juboba> k1l, would you recommend to upgrade to regular from LTS (this is my home computer, no server)
[21:22] <aebonyne> Sian: If the package doesn't like that idea, it will show dependency errors.
[21:22] <clynamen> I'm supposed to install watchdog kernel module or they are often already in the kernel ?
[21:23] <Sian> aebonyne, it won't let me
[21:23] <k1l> juboba: the non-lts are stable too.
[21:23] <Sian> q
[21:24] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, I think I know the problem
[21:24] <sagotsky> Oh?
[21:24] <juboba> k1l, ok so I have to 12.10 -> 13.04 -> 13.10 to get there?
[21:24] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, I think you are encountering an error with ureadahead (if /var or /run are on their own partitions)
[21:25] <Hawkerz> this thread seems to have some useful info on that: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1423305
[21:25] <Eagleman> Which ports need to be open to be able to connect to a NFS server?
[21:25] <aebonyne> Sian: Odd. If you removed the repository and have updated since then... maybe try a clean so previously downloaded packages are gone, too? Really, I'm out of ideas.
[21:26] <sagotsky> that's definitely a new one for me
[21:26] <aebonyne> Sian: That's apt-get clean, deleted all downloaded packages. Saves space and forces apt to redownload packages, perhaps in your case from the right repository.
[21:26] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, check the output of mount
[21:26] <Sian> aebonyne, autoclean says there are 0 bytes to be freed
[21:27] <Sian> aebonyne, it just ocurred to me, maybe is another ppa using zorg edgers packages?
[21:28] <Eagleman> Which ports need to be open to be able to connect to a NFS server?
[21:28] <aebonyne> clean deletes more stuff than autoclean, although it shouldn't actually affect whether stuff works.
[21:28] <sagotsky> Hawkerz, here's mount http://paste.ubuntu.com/6511323/
[21:29] <aebonyne> Possible, I was trying to see if there's a way to check what repo an archive comes from, but apt-cache show doesn't tell you.
[21:30] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, looks like you're suffering from a problem with ureadahead, which runs during boot to speed up the boot process (but when /var is mounted on its own partition, apparently this breaks in some circumstances)
[21:31] <sagotsky> Seems likely.  How exactly did you find that?  I would have reinstalled long before reaching that point.

[21:32] <aebonyne> Sian: Ah, apt-cache showpkg ffmpeg will tell you where it's getting the ffmpeg package from.
[21:33] <SerGiles> hello, I have an issue with unity side bar, that is to say I cant scroll it with my mouse wheel in 13.10 like I could in 12.04. Is there a fix for this?
[21:36] <Sian> aebonyne, this is what I get http://paste.ubuntu.com/6511357/, I am either looking at the wrong place or it's using official ubuntu repo
[21:38] <odium> anyone familiar with the ubuntu 11.10 bug that arbritrarily ruins luks partitions?
[21:38] <bekks> odium: 11.10 is out of support already.
[21:38] <juboba> k1l, ok so I have to 12.10 -> 13.04 -> 13.10 to get there?
[21:38] <Beldar> odium, Is this relevant in a supported release?
[21:38] <odium> oh, I am running 13.10
[21:39] <odium> but still lost my data
[21:39] <odium> I stopped mounting this entier drive while I worked on a new ssd
[21:39] <aebonyne> Sian: The top option is a PPA.
[21:39] <Beldar> odium, Are you sure it was not user error, are you linking these loosely is the question?
[21:39] <odium> and when I went back to mount it again, using time tested methods it is no longer a valid luks partition
[21:39] <odium> I am not 100%
[21:40] <odium> but it's either this that or the nsa
[21:40] <odium> so I backed up the 1TB drive
[21:40] <odium> but I am at a loss for recovering this one.
[21:40] <Beldar> odium, Or user error be being backed up is the best answer in ythe end.
[21:40] <aebonyne> Sian: "ppa.launchpad.net_rebuntu16_pcsx-reloaded-svn". The ffmpeg from the PPA is apparently depending on packages you don't want?
[21:41] <odium> too bad the disk was full.
[21:41] <aebonyne> ... probably indirectly because nothing there mentions nvidia.
[21:41] <Beldar> odium, You can clone anything including encrypted partitions as long as you have the key file to get back in.
[21:41] <odium> If I have other volumes with identical headers can I try to back up one of them and then apply their header to the disabled volume?
[21:41] <Sian> aebonyne, the packages I don't want are the nvidia drivers. Well i'll have to use the normal pscx to aovid this
[21:42] <Sian> thanks
[21:42] <odium> Beldar, I have the key file and know the 20 digit password by heart
[21:42] <aebonyne> Sian: Glad I was able to be somewhat helpful. gtg, bye
[21:42] <odium> but I've googled and googled for an instructional.
[21:42] <Hawkerz> sagotsky, I saw a weird error in one of your logs, right around the same place your usb stuff disconnected
[21:42] <Beldar> odium, but do you have a clone/copy if it?
[21:42] <odium> I used dd to make an image
[21:43] <odium> what's a clone?
[21:43] <Hawkerz> or connected, rather
[21:43] <Beldar> odium, clone is a standard term it means what it means.
[21:43] <odium> i copied just the partition to one image and the entire disk to another.
[21:44] <Beldar> odium, All with dd?
[21:44] <odium> yes
[21:45] <odium> I want my movies back. :(
[21:45] <Beldar> odium, Not sure to be honest any copying can have mistakes, dd is problematic if it does not save the original but just transfers it, if there is a mistake.
[21:45] <nwzqqwr> rapbrain
[21:46] <Beldar> odium, Best circumstances are a copy that can be confirmed to be good before the loss of the original.

[21:47] <odium> Well, I understand the risk..
[21:47] <odium> it's just 1TB of movies.
[21:47] <kevin> what risk is that?
=== kevin is now known as Guest35688
[21:47] <odium> next time I will attempt to backup my stuff.
[21:48] <odium> at the time, I didn't have enough space to backup a TB
[21:48] <Beldar> Guest35688, What is your question referencing?
[21:48] <Jordan_U> odium: Backing up the LUKS header is also usually a good idea.
[21:48] <Guest35688> Guest35688 works just fine for me
[21:48] <nwzqqwr> trying windowsXP
[21:48] <odium> Jordan_U there is a backup
[21:49] <odium> it's somewhere in /etc/ I think
[21:49] <nwzqqwr> need audio software
[21:49] <odium> just can't locate it again.
[21:49] <aaronn23> hello guys. how does ubuntu works on mac?

[21:50] <neighborlyfriend> how do I ssh into a local host server.  password was setup. Wouldn't ssh username@localhost work.  or is it ssh user@127.0.0.1:22    and is the :22 necessary?
[21:50] <ubottu> aaronn23: For help on installing and using Ubuntu on a mac, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages
[21:50] <Jordan_U> odium: How did you backup the LUKS header?
[21:50] <Beldar> and don't just randomly comment with knowledge of context Guest35688
[21:50] <odium> uhh, I can't answer that.
[21:50] <nwzqqwr> sh has to be the same version
[21:50] <nwzqqwr> recompile from scratch
[21:50] <Beldar> without*
[21:51] <Jordan_U> odium: Why not?
[21:51] <aaronn23> thank you @xangua @ubottu
[21:51] <nwzqqwr> chech in to google check-in and "get da hook-up"
[21:51] <Guest35688> I'm trying to setup Gnome-Dictionary so that I can use it offline
[21:51] <Guest35688> any takers on that?
[21:51] <odium> Jordan_U I don't remember doing it.
[21:51] <odium> it's in /etc/lvm/archive I think
[21:51] <nwzqqwr> did sacha conan baron get a shotgun to the head?
[21:51] <odium> oh, that's not a header after all.
[21:51] <Guest35688> That would be a good iea
[21:51] <Guest35688> idea*
[21:52] <SkyCaptain> Hey chan, I like the way Nautilus automatically mounts my external hard drives when I click on them. This is the only feature that still requires me to start up X on my server. Is there any way to maintain this same functionality without starting X and Nautilus?
[21:52] <Beldar> !ot | nwzqqwr
[21:52] <odium> sorry, Jordan_U that's just lvm data

[21:52] <jhutchins> SkyCaptain: Perhaps autofs would do what you're after.
[21:53] <neighborlyfriend> what's the proper way to ssh into localhost. password was setup.
[21:53] <nwzqqwr> ato everything
[21:53] <nwzqqwr> auto everything
[21:53] <nwzqqwr> cpuDan
[21:53] <nwzqqwr> its all auto
[21:53] <xangua> Guest35688: Stardic can do that, it can even store wiki articles if I remember; haven't used it in a long time
[21:53] <SkyCaptain> hmm, I will look into that. Is it simple to just add fstab entries for every attached drive?
[21:54] <Jordan_U> SkyCaptain: udisksctl mount --block-device  /dev/foo

[21:54] <nwzqqwr> or who is controlling the netBSD algrithms
[21:54] <neighborlyfriend> help. how do I ssh into local host properly with password?
[21:55] <Jordan_U> neighborlyfriend: Why are you trying to ssh into localhost? "ssh username@localhos" should do it, but still why?

[21:58] <NHR9K> i have nearly converted all of my family to linux but the last link is my uncle he is in love with win8 metro ui, is there a dm/de that will break his attachment to windoze?
[21:58] <ikonia> NHR9K: it's called "windows"
[21:59] <mrwappie> sup
[21:59] <neighborlyfriend> i though it would all be debian right. ubuntu based on debian. it's a general terminal question on most linux's i figure.
[21:59] <ikonia> neighborlyfriend: try #debian
