<s> nginx is a web server ..... </s>

<s> <user> : start with telling which kind of binary ? is it a web service ? </s>
<s> okay so i compiled nginx from source , and did make install </s>
<s> when i type " nginx " in the command line it says you can install nginx using the following command </s>
<s> the program <unka'> can be found in the following packages : * <unka-> </s>
<s> is there a specific reason that you would want to compile it from source ? </s>
<s> ln -s DIR/where/ <unka/> DIR/it/ DIR/is/ <unka/> DIR/to/ DIR/nginx/ DIR/bin/ DIR/nginx/ </s>
<s> ya i need to add <unka> module to it </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s> any idea how to figure out where it installed </s>
<s> <user> : you compiled it - you should know where you put it </s>
<s> apt-get install locate && updatedb && locate nginx </s>
<s> it really sounds like you should n't be doing this </s>
<s> no , that wo n't work </s>
<s> it will only work if you 've put it in the search path locations </s>
<s> ah i see </s>
<s> so it would be in the folder where it was compiled ? in <unka> ? </s>
<s> <user> : depends on how you compiled it </s>
<s> <user> : have you actually looked if you can make the module you want work with the ubuntu install ? </s>
<s> <user> : just as a <unka-> . apache can be much more convenient when plugins are needed . no need for manually compiling </s>
<s> URL/https:/ <unka./> <unka/_> </s>
<s> just from the official source seems thats how they do it </s>
<s> <user> _ is now known as <user> </s>
<s> <user> : it really sounds as if this is n't something you should be doing with your current understanding </s>
<s> <user> , you know that nginx 1.10 ? is in our repos </s>
<s> <user> , i guess he specifically wants this plugin . </s>
<s> <user> : i think the build options do n't contain the modes he wants </s>
<s> ya i need <unka> , otherwise i would install from the package manager </s>
<s> is compiling from source that complicated that i shouldnt even bother ? </s>
<s> <user> , you can add that module also building the official ubuntu source : URL/https:/ URL/www.howtoforge.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> <user> : i'd certainly question it with your current understanding </s>
<s> after i run make install is there a way to undo that ? </s>
<s> some packages have make uninstall </s>
<s> which version of ubuntu would you think would run ok for firefox browsing with some html5 ( e.g . youtube ) on an 32-bit intel core duo 1gb ram laptop ? </s>

<s> kk </s>
<s> perhaps catch some dust </s>

<s> lol maybe ill wipe the server and start over after </s>
<s> god knows </s>
<s> once i figure out how to get this setup proper </s>
<s> <user> : i personally do n't like running from pendrives , so i'd give you an personal opinion rather than what you want </s>
<s> <user> , do you know when we are losing 32 bit support . soon i think . </s>
<s> <user> : i do n't to be honest , </s>
<s> understand <user> , was n't using it to run any other <unka/> ... <user> is that for all versions of ubuntu ? <unka> eta ? some of the lts looks to be for a few more years . </s>
<s> <user> , a lts has 4 or 5 years support ? then he is good until at least 2020 </s>
<s> <user> : the fact that it needs to run from ram and swap out the file system on the usb is not a method i like , i like it even less on lower spec machines </s>
<s> <user> , i agree , pendrive and persistence sounds like a way to kill some flash drives </s>
<s> ??? </s>
<s> <user> , only when the persistence fills up then you have to wipe the drive and start over </s>
<s> at least three linux distros have already quit releasing 32-bit versions , and ubuntu seems to be standing in line to do the same . is the end at hand for 32-bit mainstream distros ? </s>
<s> <user> , i have flash drives with persistance that have been running for years </s>
<s> <user> : yes </s>
<s> <user> , i was trying linux mint mate just from a few days back with a similar usb setup ... and was curious to see if <unka/> would run slightly differently ( possibly , a little more smoother ?) you make a good point nevertheless on reasons , did n't consider the drawbacks on even lower <unka'> machines . </s>

<s> and the biggie .. google chrome is to drop support for all 32-bit linux distros from march , 2016 </s>
<s> oh yeah ? </s>
<s> seems odd to say " is to drop " for something > year ago </s>
<s> well , we are getting towards the point where most 32-bit only machines cannot reasonably run the software provided in your average desktop distro , so it will probably not cause much disturbance . </s>
<s> old article for reference </s>
<s> thats one of the things you should compile by <unka> </s>
<s> well chrome i remember stopped vista windows support much earlier than their windows eol .... </s>
<s> <user> - is now known as <user> </s>
<s> <user> , good point </s>
<s> beyond hardware limitation itself , there 's no reason to run 32-bit anymore afaict </s>
<s> when did they stop making 32bit x86 ? <unk#-> years ago ? </s>
<s> <user> : on the application i could only set the email <unka-_> <unka.@_> </s>
<s> they drop 32 bit support and no one noticed </s>
<s> <user> : how many apps do you have that require 3 gigs of ram per process ? </s>
<s> interesting enough , that article says to edit the rules , but in the rules they are telling me to edit do not exist lol </s>
<s> <user> - oracle java on systems with less that 4gb ram would be one reason </s>
<s> not so much memory for me , as the computational limits of the cpu are the problem </s>
<s> <user> : oracle java is not an ubuntu package :) </s>

<s> interestingly , i think a lot of people are still running <unk#a-> on 64bit systems no ? </s>

<s> firefox 2017 strategy & roadmap ( correct title to mozilla wiki link above ) </s>
<s> <user> : to me 32-bit vs 64-bit question is of no value . we used 32-bit for a long time , we 'll use 64-bit for a long time </s>
<s> hmm <unk#/> the installer is aware of 64bit ... </s>
<s> have ubuntu started providing 64-bit firefox by default for compatable releases ? i remember having trouble getting hold of 64-bit firefox a while ago . </s>

<s> i wonder how our <unka-> are going to play with this .... </s>

<s> <user> , and if they say " green is now blue " - is it ? </s>
<s> <user> : no idea what you're talking about ? </s>
<s> <user> : makes sense , since we will take a long time to commonly saturate the memory limits of 64 bit , besides , in my normal use of a system , the cpu becomes a limit for most tasks even before i am using 4gb of ram , and that is on a fairly power 64 bit cpu . </s>
<s> joseph is now known as <user> </s>
<s> <user> , the y can print what ever on a ebook . if his local laws allow him to do it then he can do it - besides that he can do it and live with the <unka> . that its not allow to discuss here , totally understandable </s>

<s> <user> no , but just so you know how to handle such questions next time . i did n't ask for a legal advice :) </s>
<s> <user> : what some people do n't know is that you can have more than 4 gigs of memory on a x86 system . it just limits the per process memory usage </s>

<s> okay guys . power users , whats your partition scheme for installing ?? which directories do you give their own partition on the hdd and how big ? </s>
<s> but just to make sure we both understood each other correctly . we are talking about a + b and not a or b . </s>
<s> ty <user> </s>
<s> <user> , taking a look at it as well . </s>
<s> <user> : that 's entirely unnecessary . pam lets you do this without any code modifications . </s>
<s> <user> : one big partition and a small one for swap . </s>

<s> no DIR/boot/ no DIR/tmp/ </s>

<s> <user> , i hope the answer to my question is yes . now if i understood <unka> correctly , the steps are . </s>
<s> <user> : then , boot to single user mode , erase everything in DIR/tmp/ ( do n't delete DIR/tmp/ itself , though ). </s>
<s> does that mean that all temp files in the whole system get <unka> through that ram disk ? </s>
<s> 1 : create DIR/var/ DIR/lib/ <unka/> DIR/passwd/ and DIR/var/ DIR/lib/ <unka/> DIR/shadow/ and copy set up second password there . </s>
<s> <user> : no , most things do n't use DIR/tmp/ . like browser caches are in DIR/~/ DIR/.cache/ . </s>

<s> <user> : usually `sudo service whatever start` </s>
<s> <user> : that way the extra passowrd only applies to 'normal' users and you have root as an escape hatch if you screw up :) </s>
<s> <user> : yes , if the caching is done well . i 'm not sure how to set that up , though . </s>
<s> <user> : says not found . i can use `systemctl --user ... ` as the user , but when i `sudo su` to root , i ca n't interact with it </s>
<s> but that you will do in common auth </s>
<s> <user> : sorry , not sure then . </s>
<s> which sudo will also inherit . </s>
<s> <user> : depends on where you want this . could be in common-auth , could be in sshd ... </s>
<s> so maybe , i should do that for mdm & login </s>
