[02:04] <tmccrary> hi, out of the blue my x server has started crashing anytime I run an OpenGL program. It's started doing this ever since the last Xorg upgrade (I think the one involving the remote Xorg exploit).

[02:12] <the_mr_bong_show> it might be
[02:12] <tmccrary> Briguy: pray, but even that is futile because it probably won't work right
[02:12] <lufis> So kernel already has firewall included, right? So there's no need for another program?
[02:13] <Briguy> tmccrary: 1) praying is never futile 2) I just need to kill the sound server and start it up again...

[02:13] <tmccrary> You still need userspace apps to control the firewall
[02:13] <lufis> Tmccray, right, but it's on automatically?

[02:14] <Briguy> fine how can one kill all the events that are using the sound server atm?

[02:18] <fourat> do u have it on ur desktop ?
[02:19] <the_mr_bong_show> is linx better than windows
[02:19] <ShellMaza> is OpenGL installed by default?

[02:20] <lufis> Seraphim, alright, thanks
[02:20] <tmccrary> the_mr_bong_show: Depends on what you're doing. Linux has a much better feature set as far as administration and software installation. Windows has a much better user experience (for the first few weeks at least) and has far better hardware support.

[02:24] <tmccrary> I'm just afraid I'll upgrade and my whole system will die
[02:24] <roy> :O
[02:24] <cge> roy: because the kernel is in panic.
[02:24] <_jason> Cody`: what ornage are you talking about exactly?  I change to clearlooks and can't find anything right away
[02:24] <roy> yeah but why?
[02:24] <Cody`> if I change to clearlooks
[02:24] <roy> how do i fix that?
[02:24] <tmccrary> roy: Kernel panic is Linux's version of the bluescreen of death
[02:25] <Cody`> the title bar is still this fugly orange
[02:25] <Cody`> _jason: if I change the thing to any clearlooks theme, the title bar and controls stay orange. No change

[03:07] <NoUse> pip` linux won't install to FAt32, you have to delete it
[03:07] <pip`> then why doesnt ubuntu say that ?
[03:07] <bbrazil> pip`: fat32 and linux don't work too well together
[03:07] <bbrazil> pip`: for installing on that is
[03:07] <tokeman> because
[03:07] <OneTruth> ok installation is complete, but why is everything caps in my console?
[03:07] <NoUse> pip` why would Linxu install to a Microsoft filesystem?
[03:07] <tokeman> lol
[03:08] <pip`> why doesnt ubuntu tell me the problem is it cant handle fat32, dont other distros handle fat32 ?
[03:08] <tokeman> put it this way ford parts don't work on a chevy same thing with windows/linux
[03:08] <NoUse> pip` you are misunderstanding, linux can read FAT32, it can't install to it

[03:08] <Austin_powers> i am logging in under norm mode
[03:08] <tokeman> lol

[03:50] <BlueSwirl> QMario: have you tried kino?
[03:50] <apokryphos> pip`: kubuntu's the best :P
[03:50] <spikeb> pip`: it has kde instead of gnome.

[03:50] <greyhill> wre see www.winehq.org

[03:51] <QMario> Yes, but it is unable to open my .avi media files.

[03:53] <_jason> the man page for wget (specifically options -A and -R) refers to ``@pxref{Types of Files}''  What does that mean?  Where can I find that?

[03:53] <wy> I can't find openssl-dev from apt-cache search. why?
[03:53] <tovella> QMario: cinellera is a more capable video editor, but you won't find it in the ubuntu repositories.
[03:53] <eggzeck> wre, assuming you installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu and erased the entire windows partition
[03:54] <wre> i can't even get into my DESKTOp
[03:54] <greyhill> wre in windows, right?
[03:54] <LinuxJones> HIGH-FREQ: the ubuntu kernels use an initrd so most of the things like ide support are built as modules.

[04:18] <roger_mudd> Ahhh.... Are they're necessary? This post http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=89491&referrerid=48700 seems to indicate that they are not.
[04:18] <roger_mudd> "Are they"
[04:19] <wre> norm recover and memtest86+
[04:19] <bongshoe> so aparently the latest kernel basically doesn't work with SCSI drives.. how nice of the installer to inform me of that before i wasted 5 hours on this PoS
[04:19] <bongshoe> goodbye ubuntu
[04:19] <tanq> i thought i read that in linux magazine.
[04:20] <greyhill> roger_mudd I guess if you find every module you need and write it into /etc/modules you'd be okay.
[04:20] <tanq> or that may have been the article on 64 bit ubuntu.
