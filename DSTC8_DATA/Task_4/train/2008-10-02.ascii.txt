[05:11] <Shak--> usser: but this is fine now, for some reason I kept getting kernel panics with that other module I compiled, and they increased in frequency over time
[05:12] <hosstest> bobertdos: are you suggesting that flash 10 is the resolve?  And if so where can I get it?
[05:12] <bobertdos> bjb1959: Goll, you know, this has been happening to a lot of people ever since hardy came around. I have no idea why.
[05:12] <dan_> HELP: I'm having trouble with disk space -- applications are complaining of no space on device. How do i start the investigation process !!???
[05:12] <mefisto__> abe3k: is there a disk in it to mount?
[05:12] <sdwrage> Hey all.. where is php.ini usually?
[05:12] <usser> Shak--, yep same problem for me here panics with the newer kernel
[05:12] <abe3k> mefisto__ : yes
[05:12] <bjb1959> but why would it happen with pclinux0s 2008 which is Mandriva?? they have nothing to do with hardy
[05:12] <usser> Shak--, also heavy cpu usage when connecting to networks to the point where computer becomes unusable
[05:13] <usser> Shak--, many ppl report that
[05:13] <Slaj_R> Anyone?  Once again, what's the fix for this error:
[05:13] <usser> abe3k, hm weird... ls /dev/dvd*
[05:13] <Slaj_R> E: /var/cache/apt/archives/samba_3.0.28a-1ubuntu4.5_i386.deb: subprocess new pre-removal script returned error exit status 102
[05:13] <sdwrage> Can anyone tell me where php.ini is usually on ubuntu?
[05:13] <Shak--> usser: Im not sure if its the newer kernel or that specific wifi module, because if I used the machine with networking disabled it never paniced
[05:13] <l3d> here is a odd ? the term app mpg123 is there a way to set the volume for that. Like a separate volume control from the main volume.
[05:13] <bobertdos> hosstest: The first thing I tell people is to purge flash 9 and libflashsupport. Flash 10 can then be found at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html
[05:13] <abe3k> usser : "ls: cannot access /dev/dvd*: No such file or directory"
[05:13] <raDeon> how to make irssi seperate nicknames from the chat text
[05:13] <usser> Shak--, i suggest go back to hardy stock kernel 2.6.24-19 and install backports module
[05:14] <sdwrage> Can anyone tell me where PHP.INI is located on ubuntu?
[05:14] <usser> Shak--, backports is 1.2.25 and as i said its been stable for me
[05:14] <usser> abe3k, thats weird
[05:14] <Shak--> usser: I still have that kernel, I'd just have to go back and reconfigure my xorg.conf
[05:14] <jim_p> goodmorning guys. its about 7.15am here, it a cold morning, so please be patient with me :P
[05:14] <jasuus> sdwrage : use the phpinfo()
[05:14] <hosstest> bobertdos:  Thanks
[05:14] <Shak--> usser: but i'll see if this gives me anymore trouble first
[05:14] <abe3k> usser : I mounted cdrw and it went perfectly
[05:15] <usser> abe3k, so you can see the contents and all?
[05:15] <abe3k> usser : yes , but still its not DVD
[05:15] <sdwrage> jasuus. I really cant do that right now... you dont know a common place where its usually installed?
[05:15] <abe3k> usser : can't use dvd player
[05:15] <bjb1959> guess no one has a clue. thanks though
[05:15] <usser> abe3k, well try to insert a dvd data disk and mount the same way u did just now

[05:18] <eligos> hello to all
[05:18] <bullgard4> I had my T42 Ubuntu 8.04.1 in a local computer club. Back at home in a LAN behind an ADSL router I cannot obtain Internet access. ifconfig returns "inet addr: 192.168.178.11." ping 192.168.178.1 functions. ping 192.168.178.10 functions. ping www.google com does not function. How to obtain Internet access?
[05:18] <eligos> anyone know why fire fox crashes after a few youtube videos?
[05:18] <usser> bullgard4, did u ping google.com's ip
[05:19] <test> bobertdos: how to show a windows that show some script are completed...
[05:19] <bobertdos> eligos: What version of flash?
[05:19] <usser> bullgard4, ping 72.14.207.99
[05:19] <abe3k> usser :"/dev/scd0: No medium found"
[05:19] <adjioev> eligos: i have simular problem, if i listen music with totem i can then hear sound in youtube videos, have to restart firefox...
[05:19] <bullgard4> usser: No, I did 'ping www.google.com'.
[05:19] <test> bobertdos: with command
[05:19] <usser> bullgard4, try to ping the ip i gave you
[05:20] <kaushal> hi
[05:20] <slagpit> I accidently ran "sudo chmod -x +777 /*/*", is there any way to fix that?
[05:20] <kaushal> when i do aptitude update
[05:20] <abe3k> usser : its still telling me that everytime I want to mount
[05:20] <r00tintheb0x> slagpit, are you serious?
[05:20] <kaushal> i get W: A error occurred during the signature verification.
[05:20] <bullgard4> ussr
[05:20] <slagpit> r00tintheb0x: yes, I am serious
[05:20] <bullgard4> usser: "ping 72.14.207.99" functions.
[05:20] <r00tintheb0x> slagpit, what would possess you to run something like that...
[05:21] <usser> bullgard4, so you dont get the correct dns server
[05:21] <eligos> bobertdos, it says: shockwave flash 9.4 r124
[05:21] <slagpit> the same thing that posses people to have accidents
[05:21] <Carefree> rawr
[05:21] <slagpit> *possesses
[05:21] <jasuus> sdwrage : you there?
[05:21] <bobertdos> eligos: Do you have libflashsupport installed?
[05:21] <r00tintheb0x> slagpit, when you do a "ls -al /" are all your directories there with permissions "drwxrwxrwx"?
[05:21] <mefisto__> slagpit: so what did you WANT to do?
[05:22] <usser> bullgard4, do sudo gedit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
[05:22] <r00tintheb0x> brb
[05:22] <Carefree> is there any gui's for apache?
[05:22] <jasuus> sdwrage: /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
[05:22] <bullgard4> usser: I agree. But the other laptop in my LAN gets the correct DNS server.
[05:22] <eligos> adjioev, I hear that happens because alsa can't work with two different progrmas at the same time, but my problem is firefox actually crashes when I load another video
[05:22] <slagpit> if I try to boot ubuntu I get a busybox shell (guessing grub got destroyed)
[05:22] <slagpit> mefisto__: why does that matter?
[05:22] <usser> bullgard4, still lets try a public dns why not?
[05:22] <bullgard4> usser: I do use fixed addresses in my LAN, no DHCP.
[05:22] <usser> bullgard4, oh even better
[05:23] <eligos> bobertdos, yes, it's already at it's newest version according to my console
[05:23] <usser> bullgard4, sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf and add nameserver 4.2.2.1 comment out all other nameservers
[05:23] <kindofabuzz> some reason I'll get logged out and taken back to the gdm screen. any ideas?
[05:24] <abe3k> usser : maybe I have to restart
[05:24] <kindofabuzz> like X is crashing or something
[05:24] <usser> abe3k, try it
[05:24] <abe3k> usser : ok
[05:24] <bobertdos> eligos: I hate to keep suggesting flash 10 to people, but that's what I've been doing. It's pretty stable now (especially with FF 3.03 out now), and it doesn't need libflashsupport. libflashsupport is actually the unstable part of it all.
[05:25] <Slaj_R> Anyone available to answer a package management question?
=== dmsuperman_ is now known as dmsuperman
=== Indoctrine is now known as Doc|Afk
[05:25] <eligos> bobertdos, you mean to install flash from the adobe website directly?
[05:25] <dmsuperman> How can I run fsck on /?
[05:26] <bobertdos> eligos: Well, yeah, flash 10 is in RC2 status right now. It's in their labs.
[05:26] <adityag> <unconvertable> how to do i add myself into this group? "www-data" ???
[05:26] <danbh_intrepid> !fsck | dmsuperman    I think this is it
[05:26] <ubottu> dmsuperman    I think this is it: fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot
[05:26] <dmsuperman> adityag: adduser
[05:26] <dmsuperman> danbh_intrepid: I know how to fsck, I want to know how to / I can't run it on mounted filesystems and I can't start linux without mounting it
[05:27] <bullgard4> usser: I have edited " sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf" and put in that file " nameserver 4.2.2.1" (This file was empty.)
[05:27] <bullgard4> usser: What should I do now?
[05:27] <samsss> im using gnome-main-menu like opensuse menu, and i dont see a tab showing other applications but favourite apps... any idea how to have that tab to change between other apps??
[05:27] <danbh_intrepid> dmsuperman: from the message that ubottu just sent you, to the whole room: The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check
[05:27] <usser> bullgard4, cool sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[05:27] <orbisvicis> any reason why gnome-system-monitor show drstically different memory usage than snmp/free, i.e 380Mb vs 1.93Gb out of 2Gb ?

[05:28] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about audacious
[05:28] <usser> !info audacious | curz0r

[05:28] <ubottu> curz0r: audacious (source: audacious): small and fast audio player which supports lots of formats. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.5.0-2 (hardy), package size 1111 kB, installed size 3784 kB
[05:28] <curz0r> usser: completely? they just released a new version on Nov 16th, 2007

[05:41] <bobertdos> hosstest: Now something I give to people when flash 10 works out: http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/ -- This is pretty much the "official" blog that tracks its development for Linux.
[05:41] <bullgard4> usser: Ok, I have clicked on 'manual configuration'.
[05:41] <savage--> jim_p, it was working fine earlier today but somehow I think I messed it up when I copied into that other lib directory :-(
[05:41] <FAJ> zeus:  sudo srm -r <path to file>  ......................

[05:42] <jasuus> toshiba: www.google.com
[05:42] <FAJ> toshiba:  this is really not the right place to talk about hacking.

[05:43] <jenny> hello guys can someone help me with a sound problem?
[05:43] <zeus> How do I access an inaccessible file due to I/O error?
[05:43] <danbh_intrepid> toshiba: all hacking discussion should go to #ubuntu+1 or #ubuntu-dev

[05:43] <toshiba> ok guys thx
[05:43] <zeus> How do I access an inaccessible file due to I/O error?
[05:43] <FAJ> !patience
[05:43] <ubottu> The people here are volunteers, your attitude should reflect that. Answers are not always available. See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[05:43] <toshiba> i love guys :)
[05:43] <eligos> jenny, what's your issue?
[05:43] <jenny> <unconvertable> hello guys can someone help me with a sound problem?
[05:43] <jenny> oh k
[05:43] <usser> bullgard4, are any of those sound familiar?
[05:44] <jenny> ummm i upgraded to hardy and the sounds doesnt seem to be working,...for youtube cds or anything
[05:44] <shogran> jenny : did you download aoss yet?
[05:44] <jim_p> savage--: dont you remember the file you copied?
[05:44] <jenny> yes i did shogran...
[05:44] <eligos> jenny, but it was working properly in previous versions of ubuntu?
[05:44] <usser> bullgard4, remove all those and add dns's i gave you earlier and search domains just add anything: workgroup for example
[05:45] <zeus> How do I access an inaccessible file due to I/O error?
[05:45] <jenny> the problem is the sound not just the browser
[05:45] <Hackerlife> hi fdisk and df -h are giving me different reports of my system file sizes.  I am trying to use gparted, but it says that the drive i want to shrink (which is /) is 30 gbs, while i know i only have about 2 gbs of stuff in it.  i need some help thanks.
[05:45] <shogran> jenny:i see,, hmmm. do you have it all set up in your sound settings as oss or alsa?
[05:45] <Ishnu-> Does anyone know of a way to activate a program when a specific folder is opened?
[05:45] <savage--> jim_p, Yes.. it's right there in /lib/libgcc_s.so.1
[05:46] <savage--> jim_p, I'm not sure why these programs can't find it...
[05:46] <jim_p> savage--: well they may need it somewhere else
[05:46] <jenny> i have it set to alsa shogran..but ive tried all of them...i can even make beeps or any sort of test noise
[05:46] <savage--> jim_p, do you have that in /usr/lib32?
[05:47] <shogran> Jenny: damn... what soundcard are you using?
[05:47] <savage--> jim_p, interesting, so I copied that file from /lib to /usr/lib32, and now when I run firefox I get: ./firefox-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libgcc_s.so.1: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
[05:47] <jim_p> savage--: yea mine is in /lib
[05:47] <bullgard4> usser:  208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 are not familiar to me.
[05:48] <jenny> ummm let me check shorgran
[05:48] <firestorm> oh ya
[05:48] <jim_p> savage--: do not copy files here and there lol
[05:48] <firestorm> i cant see my shares on my windows pc on my network
[05:48] <firestorm> the other pcs on my network work
[05:48] <savage--> jim_p, yes I've learned that the hard way :)
[05:48] <firestorm> but not mine
[05:48] <jenny> i can remeber the command that will tell me...do u know it?
[05:48] <kaushal> can any one help me here
[05:48] <tritium> savage--: what are you doing moving system files like that?
[05:48] <jim_p> firestorm: do you use samba?
[05:48] <usser> bullgard4, thats from a company called opendns that provides publicly accesible dns servers
=== dmsuperman_ is now known as dmsuperman
[05:48] <bullgard4> usser: I do not understand your message: " remove all those and add dns's i gave you earlier and search domains just add anything: workgroup for example."
[05:48] <firestorm> default ubuntu 8.4
[05:48] <tsukasa1105> so like i screwed up my apt-get packages somehow, like, mplayer is installed but libavcodec isnt, and i manually install the dependency for libavcodec which then makes apt-get uninstall mplayer since it depends on that but it wasnt installed and it just realized that
[05:48] <firestorm> im gonna say ya
[05:48] <tritium> jenny: lspci -v may help you find it
[05:48] <NiKeCRu666> hello people.can someone help me with this please? how can i configure my 3D aceleration?
[05:48] <tsukasa1105> so how do i fix it
[05:49] <savage--> jim_p, is there a way I can restore the /usr/lib32/ directory to how it was before when I first installed 8.04?
[05:49] <jenny> tritium...i remember someone told me some other command.
[05:49] <usser> bullgard4, in the DNS tab under DNS servers remove whatever is there and add 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220
[05:49] <jim_p> savage--: the whole directory? no
[05:49] <jenny> a short comman like that one
[05:49] <bullgard4> The search domains  alien.c-base.org, cbrp3-base.org, c-base.org are from my local computer club, and I am now at home.
[05:49] <usser> bullgard4, under search domains add workgroup
[05:50] <shogran> hmmm...
[05:50] <tritium> savage--: ?
[05:50] <usser> bullgard4, right it happened because you set the ip manually, those settings are usually obtained from dhcp server
[05:50] <savage--> tritium, I accidentally copied /lib into /usr/lib32
[05:50] <jenny> i rmember someone told me what to type to find it...it listed a bunch of things but i found it ...
[05:50] <usser> bullgard4, since you dont use dhcp at home they didnt get updated
[05:50] <bullgard4> usser: I have done " in the DNS tab under DNS servers remove whatever is there and add 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220."
[05:51] <savage--> tritium, so then I just did a find for the most recently modified files (to find the ones I copied over) and then removed them.
[05:51] <usser> bullgard4, and so you are unable to resolve domain names because the dns server from computer club cannot be contacted
[05:51] <usser> bullgard4, cool
[05:51] <savage--> tritium, and now it seems that certain things aren't behaving properly
[05:51] <firestorm> so ya why cant i see my windows shares on my pc, other xp machines have no problem seeing them, and my linux can see hte other machines shares fine
[05:51] <tritium> savage--: if you must, reinstall, libgcc1
[05:51] <usser> bullgard4, under search domains remove everything and add workgroup
[05:51] <savage--> tritium, ok let me try that... can I do it via apt-get?
[05:51] <tritium> savage--: yes: sudo apt-get install --reinstall libgcc1
[05:52] <tritium> savage--: note that you need that file at /lib/libgcc_s.so.1
[05:52] <tritium> (where the package provides it)
[05:52] <bullgard4> usser: I have done " under search domains remove everything and add workgroup"
[05:52] <usser> bullgard4, cool now close network manager and try ping google.com
[05:52] <savage--> tritium, ok it's there.... and I tried running the program again but I still get error while loading shared libraries: libgcc_s.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[05:52] <savage--> tritium, is a reboot required?
[05:52] <Thanatos> Anyone here have able to access a windows network share from hardy? If so, how?
[05:52] <jenny> does antyone know the command to get my audio cards or driver to be displayed????
[05:53] <firestorm> Thanatos, i can
[05:53] <usser> Thanatos, the trick is to provide full path to the share
[05:53] <firestorm> but not on my pc
[05:53] <tritium> savage--: ldconfig may need to be run
[05:53] <FAJ> hi fdisk and df -h are giving me different reports of my system file sizes.  I am trying to use gparted, but it says that the drive i want to shrink (which is /) is 30 gbs, while i know i only have about 2 gbs of stuff in it.  i need some help thanks.  and when i click on properties of filesystem it only shows 12 gbs for both home and root, not the 36 it should.  any help please
[05:53] <danbh_intrepid> jenny: you could try lshw
[05:53] <tritium> savage--: try sudo ldconfig -v, and then run your program again
[05:53] <usser> Thanatos, theres a bug in gnome-vfs that prevents gnome from displaying shares when you just open smb://servername
[05:54] <firestorm> when i go to mitch-pc(my pc) its just blank in there
[05:54] <bullgard4> usser: I have done "close network manager and try ping google.com". It responds 0% packets lost.
[05:54] <usser> Thanatos, you have to use smb://servername/sharename
[05:54] <firestorm> but other computers on the network work
[05:54] <savage--> tritium, ok, just ran ldconfig but still same error -- it's really strange because it's right there in /lib
[05:54] <usser> bullgard4, paste the whole line
[05:54] <firestorm> usser why does it work with some computers but not others for me
[05:54] <savage--> tritium, could it be a path thing perhaps?
[05:54] <tritium> savage--: you get this error when?
[05:55] <usser> bullgard4, line after --- google.com ping statistics ---
[05:55] <bullgard4> usser: What whole line should I paste?
[05:55] <activeuser> ?
[05:55] <savage--> tritium, when I try to run the firefox executable
[05:55] <Thanatos> usser, i'm trying that now. thanks
[05:55] <FAJ> !ch | activeuser
[05:55] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ch
[05:55] <shogran> i gotta go jenny, please get better soon. im sorry your sick
[05:55] <savage--> tritium, when I run ldconfig -v I can see it first loading up libraries from /lib
[05:55] <FAJ> !ja | activeuser
[05:55] <ubottu> activeuser: <unconvertable> #ubuntu-jp <unconvertable> #kubuntu-jp <unconvertable>
[05:55] <usser> firestorm, beats me... i have same problem it works on some computers
[05:55] <usser> firestorm, but not the others
[05:55] <tritium> savage--: I'm not sure, then
[05:56] <activeuser> china
[05:56] <savage--> hmmm
[05:56] <bullgard4> usser: I have got now Internet access to http://www.google.de!
[05:56] <eligos> ok, I downloaded the tar.gz, now how do I install it?
[05:56] <physically_fit> !cn | activeuser
[05:56] <ubottu> activeuser: For Ubuntu help in Chinese : #ubuntu-cn <unconvertable> #ubuntu-tw  <unconvertable> #ubuntu-hk
[05:56] <usser> bullgard4, cool. so it was incorrect dns settings
[05:56] <FAJ> hi fdisk and df -h are giving me different reports of my system file sizes.  I am trying to use gparted, but it says that the drive i want to shrink (which is /) is 30 gbs, while i know i only have about 2 gbs of stuff in it.  i need some help thanks.  and when i click on properties of filesystem it only shows 12 gbs for both home and root, not the 36 it should.  any help please
[05:56] <firestorm> so wait usser how do i see the one htat doesnt work? in the gui
[05:56] <bullgard4> usser: Please be more specific: What DNS setting was wrong with me?
[05:57] <usser> firestorm, specify the full path ie if on windows machine you have a share named Share then in file manager type smb://serverip/Share
[05:57] <r2s> is there a paid service in google that will rank up your website in search results for a specific keyword?
[05:58] <jenny> what does it mean if it says i should run this command aas a super user?
[05:58] <usser> firestorm, ip would be better because it will definitely work as opposed to hostname which ubuntu fails to resolve oftentimes
[05:58] <FAJ> !sudo | jenny
[05:58] <ubottu> jenny: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (Gnome), or !kdesu (KDE)
[05:58] <savage--> tritium, could I use the synaptic package manager to reinstall all of my installed packages?
[05:58] <firestorm> ok how do i set the path in the gui like i would windows
[05:58] <danbh_intrepid> dmsuperman: did it work?
[05:58] <usser> bullgard4, the addresses that u added in manual configuration in network manager. the one u had before were not up to date.
[05:59] <FAJ> hi fdisk and df -h are giving me different reports of my system file sizes.  I am trying to use gparted, but it says that the drive i want to shrink (which is /) is 30 gbs, while i know i only have about 2 gbs of stuff in it.  i need some help thanks.  and when i click on properties of filesystem it only shows 12 gbs for both home and root, not the 36 it should.  any help please
[05:59] <kristjan_> what's this ".gvfs" thing in $home?
[05:59] <eligos> can any one tell me how to install a tar.gz ??
[05:59] <FAJ> eligos:  you have to extract it and compile it:
[05:59] <FAJ> !compile | eligos
[05:59] <ubottu> eligos: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first)
[06:00] <tritium> savage--: yes, but that would take a very long time.
[06:00] <firestorm> usser im new to ubuntu how do i set the directory path in the file window
[06:00] <FAJ> any help anyone?
[06:00] <savage--> tritium, i'm trying it now:-)
[06:00] <bruenig> firestorm: type it
[06:00] <tritium> savage--: I'd advise against it
[06:00] <dmsuperman> danbh_intrepid: I restarted into recovery mode and did it
[06:00] <dmsuperman> danbh_intrepid: The problem was that wasn't it
[06:00] <Ishnu-> <unconvertable> Is there a way to view all folders open? lsof lists all files open, and I want something like that, but with folders.
[06:00] <dmsuperman> danbh_intrepid: And those errors I was getting can't be found in my syslog anywhere
[06:01] <bullgard4> usser: Thank you very much for your help.
[06:01] <usser> firestorm, click on little icon to the very left of address bar
[06:01] <eligos> FAJ, but there's no code, just a file called "flashplayer-installer"
[06:01] <usser> firestorm, that should turn it into text field in which u can enter the address
[06:01] <FAJ> eligos:  then just double click on it?
[06:01] <Thanatos> usser, I'm trying to access my windows share. In nautilus I'm putting "smb:///desktop/d/" where d is a folder that I am sharing. and it says "couldn't find ....."
[06:01] <firestorm> ah ic thanks
[06:02] <eligos> FAJ, I did, nothing happened
[06:02] <FAJ> eligos:  have you installed flashplugin-nonfree yet?  that may be what you are looking for
[06:02] <brian_> has anyone ever heard of kubuntu killing HDDs?
[06:02] <FAJ> !flash
[06:02] <ubottu> To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash (a recent version for !Dapper is available in !backports) - See also !Restricted and !Gnash
[06:02] <brian_> on a desktop
[06:02] <usser> Thanatos, try to substitute desktop for the actual ip address of your windows machine
[06:02] <firestorm> hm
[06:02] <firestorm> i think i see why
[06:03] <FAJ> hi fdisk and df -h are giving me different reports of my system file sizes.  I am trying to use gparted, but it says that the drive i want to shrink (which is /) is 30 gbs, while i know i only have about 2 gbs of stuff in it.  i need some help thanks.  and when i click on properties of filesystem it only shows 12 gbs for both home and root, not the 36 it should.  any help please
[06:03] <firestorm> in the other pcs on my network the password was just blank
[06:03] <trollboy_> what's up with W: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/f/firefox-3.0/firefox_3.0.2+build6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1_all.deb
[06:03] <firestorm> but on mine i had to enter the actual user password
[06:03] <firestorm> but you dont have to do that on xp
[06:03] <firestorm> so i dunno why the settings are different
[06:04] <firestorm> also whats the best music player i guess most similar to wmp11
[06:04] <usser> firestorm, i dont think such an abomination exists on linux
[06:04] <Thanatos> usser, It's still not finding it. It's so frustrating, cuz it worked in Gutsy.
[06:05] <dmsuperman> firestorm: You might want to try amaroK
[06:05] <usser> firestorm, try rhythmbox amarok but they would be more similar to itunes
[06:05] <dmsuperman> firestorm: Exaile is a more basic one
[06:05] <usser> Thanatos, hm can you ping the ip?
[06:05] <Thanatos> firestorm, vlc media player works just fine
[06:05] <firestorm> ok how do i get those
[06:06] <jenny> does anyone know the command to run to get my sound card name?? still trying to figure it out
[06:06] <firestorm> ya i know vlc would work but i want like an organized list of my music
[06:06] <firestorm> playlists etc
[06:06] <firestorm> whats the apt get command for those players
[06:06] <firestorm> i also need to get mp3 support
[06:06] <Thanatos> usser, Ping returns a surprisingly long time of about 900ms, but it works
[06:06] <mefisto__> jenny: asoundconf list
[06:06] <tritium> firestorm: for your benefit, learn to search for them in synaptic, and install them from there
[06:06] <gbear14275> does gparted support jfs partitions?
[06:06] <tritium> !mp3 | firestorm
[06:06] <ubottu> firestorm: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[06:06] <usser> Thanatos, thats weird providing the whole path always worked for me. are u sure you got the name of the share right? in windows you can set it to whatever you want it doesnt have to necessarily be the same as folder name
[06:07] <gbear14275> I am trying to create one as a logical drive but the option does not seem to be available
[06:07] <usser> Thanatos, oh my... on a local network?
[06:07] <samsss> http://primates.ximian.com/~jpr/Screenshot-gnome-main-menu-1.png       can someone check this image, im missing the "show:" tab--- pleease
[06:07] <lliw00> is there any reason i would be getting a socket error when using xsupplicant/
[06:07] <Thanatos> usser, make that .900 ms
[06:07] <randancing> Jenny. I tried the command that tritium gave you and it works on 7.10. Give it a try.
[06:07] <jenny> im on 8.04
[06:07] <usser> Thanatos, hehe thats a big difference :)
[06:07] <tritium> jenny: it will still work
[06:07] <firestorm> i suppose tritium but isnt apt get faster is there a way to search for similar named things in apt get
[06:07] <jenny> and what was the command again..and i need to run as super user..so do i just put sudo before it?
[06:08] <usser> Thanatos, double check the share name
[06:08] <tritium> firestorm: no, synaptic is simply a front-end to apt-get
[06:08] <tritium> firestorm: you can use "apt-cache search <foo>"
[06:08] <firestorm> ya i know but fast in that i dont have to use a gui
[06:08] <tritium> firestorm: yes, use apt-cache search, then
[06:09] <firestorm> alright thanks
[06:09] <gbear14275> <unconvertable> can anyone suggest a partition program that supports jfs, gparted does not seem to
[06:11] <jenny> tritium: <unconvertable> nd what was the command again..and i need to run as super user..so do i just put sudo before it?
[06:11] <tritium> jenny: what are you trying to do?
=== jesse_ is now known as zero-jt
[06:12] <jenny> the sommand u gave me to enter for my sound card name...i did but i t didnt work cause i have to enter it as super user....and i dont know how
[06:12] <firestorm> arg
[06:12] <tritium> jenny: you don't need sudo to use "lspci"
[06:13] <prohna> i wanna do an HD install of damn small linux is there anyway i can do that from this ubuntu install and dual boot?
[06:13] <prohna> without losing ubuntu
[06:13] <tritium> jenny: you can also try "lshw -class sound"
[06:13] <Radit> how do i search for files in ubuntu?
[06:13] <tritium> !locate | Radit
[06:13] <ubottu> Radit: locate is a command-line file search utility. To make sure its cache is up to date run: sudo updatedb
[06:14] <tritium> Radit: there are others, such as "find", "whereis", "which"
[06:14] <subone> hi, i dunno what i did but now everytime i load up m,y computer i get the desktop wallpaper without icons, my irc, and then no gnome-panel, can anyone help me troubleshoot this?
[06:14] <Radit> tritium: thanks, i'll try
[06:14] <jenny> tritium..first one doesnt tell me..and second one says...run as super user
[06:14] <Thanatos> firestorm, how did you get access to ur windows network share?
[06:14] <subone> and apparently compiz is running too
[06:15] <prohna> subone: stop compiz
[06:15] <firestorm> Thanatos, ya
[06:15] <subone> kill it?
[06:15] <prohna> subone: sure
[06:15] <firestorm> Thanatos, smb://mitch-pc/media/
[06:15] <firestorm> is mine
[06:15] <firestorm> so you have to know your computers computer name
[06:15] <subone> ok now i have no window manager running either lol
[06:16] <firestorm> and the name of the shared folder
[06:16] <firestorm> and then it asked me to login
[06:16] <jenny> <unconvertable> tritium..first one doesnt tell me..and second one says...run as super user
[06:16] <subone> so now what
[06:16] <SebNaitsabes> jenny: yes if it says super user
[06:16] <SebNaitsabes> jenny:  sudo yep
[06:16] <tritium> jenny: you'd have to look carefully at the output of "lspci -v"
[06:17] <SebNaitsabes> jenny:  or if it's a graphical application you want to run you could do gksudo
[06:17] <subone> is there a way to run a console in X from another virtual terminal? that would make this a little easier
[06:17] <tritium> jenny: regarding your 2nd question, "sudo lshw -class sound"
[06:17] <Radit> I'm looking for calendar*.ics, i  used: locate calendar*.ics; even though there is a file named calendar.ics in my system locate doesn't find it
[06:17] <SebNaitsabes> jenny:  and output of commands such as lspci, may be a bit  confussing to understand, if your new to Linux
[06:18] <lliw00> can anyone tell me why im getting a socket error in hardy about xsupplicant
[06:18] <Thanatos> exit
[06:19] <prohna> if i use gparted to create a new partition to install dsl to will it screw up my ubuntu install?
[06:19] <SebNaitsabes> probhna: well yes if you accidently delete Ubuntu
[06:19] <Radit> <unconvertable> I'm looking for calendar*.ics, i  used: locate calendar*.ics; even though there is a file named calendar.ics in my system locate doesn't find it
[06:19] <SebNaitsabes> prohna: if you accidently delete the Ubuntu partitoin
[06:19] <Radit> am i doing something wrong?
[06:19] <Spherous> Hey, I installed Songbird and it ran right, but I accidentally deleted the folder, so I redownloaded it and now when I open it I get a line in the middle of my screen that I can resize but all thats there is a black box... any ideas?
[06:19] <SebNaitsabes> prohna:  ,but  you should be able to put DSL on another partition and  edit Grub if it does not already do it, so both can boot
[06:19] <prohna> SebNaitsabes: so if im careful and dont touch this partition i can do this?
[06:20] <subone> prohna: you still there?
[06:20] <prohna> subone: yeah
[06:20] <subone> what now :p
[06:20] <SebNaitsabes> probhna: but dual booting is a bit sucky, why not just do  DSL in a virtualmachien inside Ubuntu?
[06:20] <prohna> subone: can you open a terminal?
[06:20] <SebNaitsabes> probhna: well if you got at least 512MB RAM that is
[06:20] <subone> prohna: virtual terminal
[06:20] <prohna> SebNaitsabes: i only have 512 :)
[06:20] <SebNaitsabes> prohna: that's enough
[06:20] <subone> prohna: idk how to run one in X without any terminal open or alt+f2
[06:21] <prohna> subone: yer not even in gnome?
[06:21] <schnoods> anyone know if there is a GTK equivelant of Krita ?
[06:21] <subone> prohna: yeah but gnome-panel hasnt started
[06:21] <subone> or crashed on load or something
[06:21] <prohna> subone: what if you hit alt f2
[06:21] <prohna> nothing?
[06:21] <SebNaitsabes> prohna:  yep dual booting two Linux distros would suck quite a lot,   having the second in a virtual machine though, would be pretty good, and then you can use both at same time
[06:21] <subone> nothing
[06:21] <subone> tried that :p
[06:22] <prohna> subone: idk then
[06:22] <subone> prohna: i can use the virtual terminal of course
[06:22] <jasuus_> schnoods: yea, GIMP :)
[06:22] <prohna> SebNaitsabes: i should just install dsl to this other tower here
[06:22] <prohna> SebNaitsabes: but i only got on monitor lol
[06:22] <subone> anyone else then?
[06:23] <Anon9050> anyone what to try this one:  how to rename the home directory !
[06:23] <SebNaitsabes> !monitor
[06:23] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about monitor
[06:23] <SebNaitsabes> !screen
[06:23] <ubottu> screen is a terminal multiplexer. See http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen
[06:24] <jim_p> Anon9050: the /home or /home/user ?
[06:24] <Jordan_U> !msgthebot | SebNaitsabes
[06:24] <ubottu> SebNaitsabes: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (type also /msg ubottu Bot). Don't use commands in the public channels if you don't know if they really exist. Also avoid adding joke/useless factoids.
[06:24] <SebNaitsabes> prohna: think there's a good way to share two computers on same monitor
[06:24] <SebNaitsabes> prohna: but not sure
[06:25] <Anon9050>  home/user
[06:25] <subone> im linking my website here just so that i can try to open firefox at least :p http://subone.org
[06:25] <Anon9050> There has got to be an easy way to code this
[06:25] <SebNaitsabes> prohna:  and there are ways you can use the other computer without  having the screen plugged in to it,  I just thought of something
[06:26] <subone> nope that didnt work...
[06:26] <Scottas> goodmorning
[06:26] <subone> how do you run an app in X from a virtual terminal?
[06:26] <Anon9050> usermod -l for the username works great but when I try to rename the directory it crashes
[06:28] <adityag> <unconvertable> "sudo chmod -R 0760 *" modifies only the current folder(not the folders in that current folder) . how to make it recursive in the directories too?
[06:28] <generic> dose any one else have problems playing custom sounds on the login window?
[06:28] <bullgard4> What is the function of the file /etc/resolv.conf? (I am using network-manager and no DHCP in a LAN behind an ADSL router.)
[06:29] <jenny> SEBNAITSABES CHECK UR PM
[06:29] <Anon9050> Geniric: ass file to /usr/share/sounds
[06:29] <tritium> bullgard4: to define domain name servers
[06:30] <generic> Anon9050: Ok i will try that
[06:30] <tritium> bullgard4: see "man resolv.conf"
[06:31] <Anon9050> generic  are you there
[06:31] <generic> yes
[06:31] <Anon9050> move the .wav file to the Desktop first
[06:31] <generic> ok
[06:31] <Anon9050> then:  cd Desktop
[06:31] <SebNaitsabes> !sound > jenny
[06:31] <ubottu> jenny, please see my private message
[06:32] <generic> why not just put it in usr/ahare/sounds
[06:32] <Anon9050> then sudo cp nameoffile.wav /usr/share/sounds
[06:32] <generic> ok
[06:33] <Anon9050> than go back and search for file in the login manager
[06:33] <nownot> is there a way to see what caused my system to reboot?
[06:34] <tritium> generic: it's not generally advisable to drop files into system directories
[06:34] <tritium> generic: if you want to make system-level changes on your machine, use the directories under /usr/local/
[06:34] <bullgard4> tritium: man revolv.conf is incomprehensible to me. --  How is it possible that it contained not the address of my ADSL router although my computer had Internet access before I visited a local computer club last night?
[06:35] <generic> Anon9050: Thanks alot! thats always been alittle promlem on my back howd u know?
[06:35] <Anon9050> tritium what is the risk !!
[06:35] <tritium> bullgard4: I'd have to know more about your configuration
[06:36] <nownot> is there a way to see what caused my system to reboot?
[06:36] <tritium> Anon9050: overwriting files under package-management is one.  That's the purpose of providing the /usr/local/ directory structure.
[06:36] <tritium> nownot: logs under /var/log/
[06:36] <Anon9050> tritium explain further please
[06:37] <nownot> tritium: which one theres like 50
[06:37] <bullgard4> tritium: I have 2 Ubuntu 8.04.1 laptop computers in a LAN using network-manager and fixed addresses behind an ADSL router.
[06:37] <schnoods> anyone know if there is a GTK equivelant of Krita ? which isnt GIMP :P
[06:37] <generic> also does know if you can veiw a chm in the term? I tried the more file.chm thing but the encoding went crazy
[06:37] <danbh_intrepid> generic: I think there is a wine program for that
[06:38] <tritium> bullgard4: if you're using fixed addresses, network-manager will ignore them
[06:38] <generic> no i can veiw chms in the gui with xchm i meant in the shell
[06:38] <tritium> bullgard4: note from /usr/share/doc/network-manager/README.Debian that "Only devices that are *not* listed in /etc/network/interfaces are managed by NM.
[06:38] <subone> is there something i should run before gnome-panel? because i tried to run it and it didnt... it just sat there... i got metacity running
[06:39] <tritium> subone: you shouldn't be running gnome-panel manually
[06:39] <generic> can some one help?
[06:39] <subone> tritium: well i have little choice i asked for help and nobody answered
[06:39] <|0sts0u|> nownot: start with kern.log and syslog
[06:40] <tritium> subone: nobody is forcing you to run gnome-panel manually
[06:40] <generic> subon: was the panel worjing automaticly before?
[06:40] <bullgard4> tritium: Thank you for answering. I will need more time to think about that and to understand.
[06:41] <subone> tritium: i didnt say they were... what do you recommend i do just call my laptop a loss and reinstall or try to do something about it?
[06:41] <tritium> subone: I didn't see your initial question.  What's the problem?
[06:41] <subone> hi, i dunno what i did but now everytime i load up m,y computer i get the desktop wallpaper without icons, my irc, and then no gnome-panel, can anyone help me troubleshoot this?
[06:42] <tritium> bullgard4: if you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces, please, I'll look at it
[06:42] <subone> i've since killed compiz and started metacity, but idk what now
[06:42] <tritium> subone: have you restarted gdm?
[06:42] <Alyxander> hey room whats a program to allow me to view file metadata?
[06:42] <subone> gdm... lemme try
[06:42] <generic> gdm is login i think he means gtk
[06:43] <tritium> subone: sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart
[06:43] <generic> ?
[06:43] <tritium> generic: no, I mean gdm
[06:43] <tritium> subone: switch to a v.c. before you try that
[06:43] <generic> isnt gdm login only
[06:43] <tritium> generic: it invokes Z
[06:43] <tritium> X, rather
[06:43] <Anon9050> tritium i went to /usr/local/  no place for sounds  mkdir  placed file  login does not see the file !
[06:43] <subone> tritium: i only have vterminal :p
[06:43] <tritium> generic: if you don't believe me, try killing it ;)
[06:44] <Alyxander> hey room whats a program to allow me to view file metadata?
[06:44] <subone> tritium:  i tried running gnome-terminal but it didnt work
[06:44] <generic> o so resarting gdm resarts X window system too?
[06:44] <tritium> generic: yes, give it a try, if you like
[06:44] <subone> `sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart` or ` sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart &` ?
[06:44] <Serway> Hey, can someone help me with a simple command to set my computer to sleep 15 minutes from now? thanks!!!!

[06:46] <generic> try to sudo it
[06:46] <Anon9050> tritium:  Thank you very much.  I learned something new.  Thats always worth it for me.
[06:46] <generic> it its not ur spelliing ;)
[06:46] <subone> nope not my spelling
[06:46] <generic> try to sudo it
[06:47] <subone> i did
[06:47] <generic> whats the command?
[06:47] <tritium> Anon9050: no problem :)
[06:47] <tritium> generic: sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart
[06:47] <firestorm> oh ya
[06:47] <firestorm> whats up with the regular multiverse and universe sections in the apt thing
[06:48] <tritium> bullgard4: so your ADSL router is 192.168.178.1?
[06:48] <generic> hmm it should work
[06:48] <bullgard4> tritium: Yes.
[06:48] <Alyxander> hey room whats a program to allow me to view file metadata?
[06:48] <Anon9050> tritium:  want to try a stab at my problem?  How do you rename the /home/username  directory
[06:48] <tritium> bullgard4: what's in your /etc/resolv.conf?
[06:49] <subone> hmm i got gnome-terminal to diplay but theres nothing in it its just all black lol
[06:49] <subone> no menu either lol
[06:49] <Anon9050> usermod -d and mv  do not work!  the system crashes  even when done at root
[06:49] <generic> Anon9050: u mean to rename the user name directory?
[06:49] <tritium> Anon9050: if you do that, you'll have to chown all the files below it, and edit /etc/passwd to reflect the change in the user's $HOME
[06:49] <firestorm> whats up with the universe multiverse and nothing things in software add remover
[06:50] <bullgard4> tritium: Now there is one line: 'nameserver 192.168.178.1'.
[06:50] <nomingzi> i m newbie, pls advise me how to create VPN connection to remote VPN server ?
[06:50] <generic> all config files you run under the usernam work work after a rename
[06:50] <subone> tritium: invoke-rc.d man says i need two params "name" and "action"
[06:50] <generic> i think ull need to renam the user
[06:50] <Anon9050> How is that usually done?  There has to be an easy way to code this.
[06:50] <tritium> subone: then you're not calling it properly.  I gave you the proper command.
=== Kwitschibo_ is now known as Kwitschibo
[06:51] <generic> their probably is but ive never needed to do this srry i cant help
[06:51] <joseph_> Could anybody help me sort out my repositories? It's all messed up
[06:51] <subone> tritium: how am I not calling it properly you only gave me 1 parameter i just told you man says you need two
[06:51] <tritium> bullgard4: that would be correct
[06:51] <tritium> subone: I gave you the name: gdm and the action: restart
[06:51] <nomingzi> how to i setup a VPN connection to remote VPN device/server ?
[06:52] <tritium> subone: how are name + action not two parameters?
[06:52] <subone> tritium: ah i didnt see your second post
[06:52] <tritium> subone: all my posts said "sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart"
[06:52] <subone> my bad i missed the gdm completely
[06:53] <Anon9050> tritium:  cd /home/username chown chgrp *
[06:53] <bullgard4> tritium: How is it possible that network-manager overwrote this line last night when I visited a local computer club and used its WLAN?
[06:53] <favro> joseph_: can you paste the file /etc/apt/sources.list?
[06:53] <favro> !paste
[06:53] <ubottu> pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu.com (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[06:53] <joseph_> ok
[06:54] <firestorm> whats up with the universe multiverse and nothing things in software add remover
[06:54] <tritium> bullgard4: that's what it does.  When you roam, it acquires new DNS servers via DHCP, and modifies your /etc/resolv.conf accordingly so that you have domain name resolution
[06:54] <bullgard4> tritium: Thank you for explaining.
[06:54] <tritium> bullgard4: no problem
[06:55] <matiu> Is there a script like freebsd's portaudit ?
[06:55] <matiu> That would hook the rss feed from ubuntu's security announcements http://www.ubuntu.com/usn
[06:55] <joseph_> favro: I exaggerate with the use of ultamatix   http://paste.ubuntu.com/53095/
[06:55] <matiu> to a command line tool that would tell me which package versions I have installed that are listed on the USN page..
[06:56]  * ghoti waves
=== gOLDfish is now known as afallenhope
[06:57] <ghoti> Can anyone tell me if there's a tool for ubuntu that does what "portaudit" does in FreeBSD?  That is, report which security notices affect packages installed on a particular system?
[06:57] <favro> joseph_: I would put a comment (#) in front of the ultamatix lines then sudo apt-get update
[06:58] <Anon9050> tritium:  I took a look at tree and all the files have the new user name EXCEPT THE HOME DIRECTORY FILE !
[06:58] <favro> joseph_: the rest looks fine
[06:58] <joseph_> favro:  why is it that I get a gpg key missing when I add wine repositories
=== BOG is now known as Guest19853
[06:59] <tritium> Anon9050: so you're going to rename the directory next?
[06:59] <subone> tritium: well that didnt work i had to restart
[06:59] <favro> joseph_: afaik the gpg key is a seperate d/load
[06:59] <tritium> subone: and what happened after a reboot?
[06:59] <joseph_> ok, thanks
[06:59] <subone> same thing
[07:00] <subone> compiz is running, xchat, desktop wallpaper... nohting else
[07:00] <Anon9050> done that at root by:  usermod -d newuser name    than  mv oldusername newusername    at that point the system crashes,  nothing works.
[07:01] <Anon9050> I reverse the code and place the old name back and everything comes back
[07:01] <subone> is there some logs i should be checking?
[07:02] <Anon9050> Twelve hours later,  I toast !!
[07:02] <tritium> Anon9050: yes, you'd not want to run that command as that same user
[07:02] <|0sts0u|> Anon9050 are you trying to move your user directory while you are logged in as either user? Access violations
[07:03] <Anon9050> no i'm doing this as root
[07:03] <tritium> Anon9050: root, or using sudo as one of those two users?
[07:03] <Anon9050> ROOT ONLY !!
[07:04] <quasimodo> is it possible to get a recent rubygems installation on ubuntu? the apt version is 1.1 (ancient) and gem update --system tells that is 'disabled on debian' and one should use apt-get.. which is bullshit too, because on debian gem update --system works fine..
[07:04] <Anon9050> system crashes
[07:04] <tritium> Anon9050: no need for all-caps.  You've enabled the root account?
[07:04] <Anon9050> yes
[07:04] <quasimodo> tired of installing things by hand.. when i do this, i choose gentoo..
[07:05] <tritium> Which, of course, we don't advise.
[07:05] <FatalError> How do I figure out who owns a particular package in apt?
[07:05] <tritium> !language | quasimodo
[07:05] <ubottu> quasimodo: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
[07:05] <vr8mf> hi, it is possible to configure network conection from terminal? or i can add the network icon in my menu in any way?
[07:05] <DistoJunky> Aloha
[07:05] <Anon9050> the only thing that I have not tried is a cold boot,  i concerned with the system unstable,  it might not come back up !
[07:06] <quasimodo> huh?
[07:06] <subone> tritium: any other suggestions?
[07:06] <quasimodo> well, sorry i bothered you...
[07:06] <quasimodo> hope to not see you again in this case... friendly here...
[07:06] <tritium> quasimodo: in other words, please don't use foul language in this channel
[07:06] <Jordan_U> quasimodo: Looks like intrepid has rubygems 1.9, you could backport it
[07:06] <tritium> subone: no, sorry
[07:07] <subone> its funny i would have thought someone would have pointed me to some logs by now
[07:07] <Jordan_U> subone: logs for?
[07:07] <tritium> subone: did you look at the logs under /var/log/?
[07:07] <subone> tritium: which?
[07:08] <subone> Jordan_U: idk, something that would tell me why i booted into X with only xchat and nothing else, no gnome-panel or anything
[07:08] <mhz128> hi all
[07:08] <mhz128> is there any way to change desktop icon size? not individually
[07:08] <tritium> subone: /var/log/Xorg.0.log is where I'd start
[07:08] <subone> ok
[07:09] <FatalError> because xchat 2.8.4 has a nasty file descriptor leak... it's been fixed in newer versions, but the version in the hardy repo has the bug
[07:10] <Anon9050> mhz128: I'm kinda slow with these things.  How bout..........increase the font size
[07:10] <Jordan_U> subone: Try logging out, log in to the "failsafe terminal" session from gdm then run "gnome-session 2>&1 | tee gnome-session-output.txt"

[07:15] <Jordan_U> person: If you want all applications to use alsa rather than try to use pulseaudio change everything to alsa in System -> Preferences -> Sound
[07:16] <subone> thanks for everynes help
[07:16] <Snipefast> where is gnome 2 located
[07:17] <person> alright, i tried what you guys said including what the bot said and still no cigar
[07:17] <simon_b> someone could help me a bit with configuring devices, using serial
[07:17] <simon_b> ?
[07:17] <tritium> Snipefast: ~/.gnome2/ and ~/.gnome2_private/
[07:18] <person> rythembox = no audio, youtube = no audio
[07:18] <tritium> person: I doubt you mean to imply equality there
[07:18] <Anon9050> tritium can you explain the difference between gnome2 and gnome2_private
[07:19] <tritium> Anon9050: sorry, I don't recall
[07:19] <Anon9050> cool
[07:20] <Anon9050> I'm assuming gnome2_private is your own settings on your system
[07:20] <vr8mf> how can i add the network icon in myMenu?
[07:20] <tritium> Anon9050: ~/.gnome2/ is also your own private settings in your home directory.
[07:20] <Anon9050> I see
[07:21] <tritium> Anon9050: ~/ is your $HOME
[07:21] <Anon9050> got it

[07:22] <ubottu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

[07:30] <TrekCycling> balz, Hmmm... weird. Sure you're using cups? Which version of Ubuntu?
[07:30] <balz> TrekCycling:  this is a mythbuntu box but i installed cups via apt-get
[07:30] <balz> i thought it was weird too
[07:30] <tritium> weird?  Ubuntu uses cups by default
[07:30] <gagita> there are any answer for my question ?
[07:30] <gagita> :(
[07:30] <jf13> well I tried to fix flashplayer now I have no sound in any application but have sound in sys>pref>sound in any form lol
[07:30] <balz> i should add that it prints everything fine except for .pdf... =/
[07:31] <person> can anyone help me? audigy 2 zs and onboard sound conflicting?
[07:31] <toshiba> I need hacking programs for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
[07:31] <balz> tritium:  this is mythbuntu though, so it's skimmed down

[07:31] <balz> tritium:  you sure?  i had to manually install everything for network printing support
[07:31] <tritium> balz: positive
[07:32] <jf13> if I purge pulse out of the system will it reset everything or just rid me of pulse sound server?
[07:32] <balz> toshiba, you must be kidding about the hacking programs...
[07:32] <tritium> jf13: it will leave you a big mess
[07:32] <balz> tritium:  do you by any chance know why cups might not be handling .pdf files?
[07:33] <jf13> I have no sound can't see anything worse lol  ohwell
[07:33] <tritium> balz: no, sorry.  But a "dpkg -l | grep cups" on my mythbuntu 8.04 installation confirms that cups is in use

[07:33] <hampsterx> how do i remove .local from the network name. i dont really want to browse http://mypc.local
[07:33] <tritium> No, his question was offtopic, and not appropriate.
[07:34] <balz> tritium:  this keeps getting weirder and weirder.  Can you pastebin the print-related packages that are on your myth box so that i can double check against mine?
[07:34] <tritium> balz: sure
[07:34] <balz> tritium:  thanks a lot
[07:34] <zefyx> silly skiddie

[07:38] <jf13> i guess i could look myself in wikki
[07:38] <balz> dammit are the repository servers down?
[07:38] <nlund> not the last time I apt'ed like an hour ago
[07:39] <tritium> balz: win?
[07:39] <balz> tritium:  no i can't connect to the repos =/
[07:39] <tritium> balz: no, I was asking what you mean by "win"
[07:39] <jf13> exit
[07:40] <balz> tritium:  oh. sorry.  stupid internet speech ... i meant that I might have a solution
[07:41] <tritium> balz: gotcha
[07:42] <balz> I keep getting this error when I try to apt-get:   Err http://archive.ubuntu.com hardy/main libgnomecups1.0-1 0.2.3-1ubuntu1     Could not connect to archive.ubuntu.com:80 (91.189.88.31). - connect (113 No route to host) [IP: 91.189.88.31 80]
[07:42] <balz> what gives/
[07:42] <balz> ?
[07:42] <nlund> try tracerouting to it
[07:43] <balz> nlund what's the command?
[07:43] <balz> and are there alternate repository servers i can add to sources.list?
[07:43] <nlund> tracroute <ip>
[07:43] <nlund> traceroute 91.189.88.31
[07:43] <gagita> tcptraceroute
[07:44] <nlund> not sure what tcptraceroute is, but if that is an alternative you can use that.
[07:45] <balz> neither work. i don't ahve traceroute-nanog or traceroute installed... =/
[07:45] <nlund> ifconfig to see if your networkings up :)
[07:45] <nlund> lol
[07:46] <balz> nlund it looks as though it is.  i'm connected via ssh from a client anyway
[07:46] <balz> and the client has internet access
[07:46] <balz> and i'm on IRC =)
[07:46] <nlund> gotcha.. I was partially joking
[07:46] <balz> nlund... sorry my sarcasm detector is a bit off =)
[07:46] <nlund> lol
[07:46] <balz> plus it's late
[07:47] <nlund> well if traceroute's not working, my guess is ping maybe... not sure if ping is held back on that IP though
[07:47] <balz> nlund:  maybe the server's down for backups or something... it is almost 3 in the morning
[07:48] <nlund> good point.. let me try tracerouting to it from AZ
[07:48] <balz> yeah taht would be great. Are there alternate servers out there?
[07:48] <SurfnKid> im sorry but i have to do this http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1832002
[07:48] <person> can someone help me please? my audio fluctuates between some programs working (rhythmbox, vlc, youtube) and sometimes not. i have an audigy 2 zs in my pci slot but i can't figure out how to set it as default so i'm using my onboard intel audio for now, but vlc and youtube aren't playing audio, yet rhythmbox is
[07:48] <balz> haha that is a good one, surfnkid
[07:49] <nlund> hmmm I tracerouted fine
[07:49] <bpr> Hey, I just enabeled pre-released updates and unsupported updates (for Hardy) and now only one app at a time has "access" to the my soundcard (for output).  In order to let another app play sound, I need to quit the one currently playing sound and then start the other.  For example, if I'm listening to music w/Rhythm box but want to watch some YouTube, I must quit rhythmbox and then start Firefox in order for Firefox to be able to play
[07:49] <bpr> sound.
[07:49] <bpr> any idea why this might be?
[07:50] <bpr> or any idea where to go to get some info on how to start debugging this?
[07:50] <balz> nlund. the only thing i can think of is that I changed my router's IP from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.2
[07:51] <nlund> balz: well your routing properly since your on here
[07:51] <bpr> sound was working fine before I enabled those updates, fyi
[07:51] <balz> good point....
[07:51] <nlund> it could be just a problem with the ISP your on getting to that IP
[07:52] <balz> possibly.  if i typed the ip in the address bar of my browser, maybe that would give me some indication
[07:52] <bpr> person: maybe your problem is the same as mine?
[07:52] <gligorhoria> root@horia-laptop:/home/lfs/lfs# mount -v --bind /dev #LFS/dev
[07:52] <gligorhoria> mount: special device udev does not exist
[07:52] <nlund> as far as options, I'm a debian/gentoo/centos/etc user that just started using ubuntu
[07:52] <person> not sure, i disabled those unofficial updates
[07:52] <gligorhoria> what am i doing rong?
[07:52] <bpr> did you downgrade from those updates afterward?
[07:53] <balz> nlund:  it shows up in the browser... so who knows
[07:53] <balz> i also noticed that i can't access IMDB from the myth box anymore
[07:53] <platius> blaz; http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-select-fastest-mirror-in-ubuntu.html     you might try this
[07:54] <person> bpr: nope, i updated after a fresh install then turned off updates
[07:54] <person> bpr: i'm really new to the linux scene so i really have nfi what's going on :/
[07:54] <nlund> balz: this should be interesting to see the answer to since I know I'll see the same problem in the future
[07:54] <vr8mf> can i add in feisty the network icon on mymenu?
[07:54] <simon_b> hi! how to see, if the serial port (ttyS0) is open?
[07:54] <bpr> person: hmm, maybe downgrading would work.  I haven't tried to do that yet.  So I don't know for sure that it would
[07:54] <bpr> person: ah.
[07:55] <balz> nlund:  ahah well i will certainly report back when i've figured it out... odly enough schedules direct seems to be working so who knows
[07:55] <nlund> simon_b: "lsof | grep -i ttys0" is the first I'd try
[07:55] <balz> maybe a nice old-fashioned reboot will solve my problems
[07:55] <bpr> person: i'm gunna reboot with an older kernel and see if that helps...
[07:56] <bpr> person: brb
[07:56] <gusx> ?
[07:56] <nlund> balz: I donno I doubt it... if it does, that is scary
[07:56] <gusx> i got this problem with some ubuntu 7.10 clients authenticating against kerberos
[07:57] <gusx> when using the needchange attribute to require  the user to change the password at next login
[07:57] <gusx> tools like kinit says that password has expired
[07:58] <balz> I have a few odd lines in daemon.log:  any idea what's up?  http://paste.ubuntu.com/53106/
[07:58] <NiKeCRu666> how can i change my screen resolution, i entered to System/Preferences/Resolution, but i only have 800x600

[08:02] <rfxcasey> gagita, but I don't see any dock

[08:02] <rfxcasey> gagita, do I have to press a key to start it
[08:02] <gusx> whatz ur specific problem balz ?
[08:02] <person> :/
[08:02] <bpr> anyways, it works for me with that kernel
[08:03] <mahmoud> hi all
[08:03] <bpr> hmm...
[08:03] <person> i suppose more googling is in store for me :(
[08:03] <bpr> sorry
[08:03] <gagita> run it from accessories
[08:03] <rfxcasey> gagita, do I have to add some launchers before it appears
[08:03] <balz> gusx:  I can't seem to use apt-get ... it says there's no rout to host
[08:03] <bpr> what sound hardware did you say you have?
[08:03] <nlund> google's like a japanese teacher... have to word your question fifty different ways
[08:03] <rfxcasey> gagita, still there?
[08:03] <gusx> so anybody here using ubuntu clients to authenticate against kerberos with problems recently (ubuntu 7.10) ?
[08:04] <person> i have an audigy 2 zs, but right now my speakers are hooked into my onboard audio slot
[08:04] <gagita> i'm back  in 10 minutes
[08:04] <Toipilas> How i can use apache2 offline? I mean i can test my server, but others cant use my server?
[08:04] <mahmoud>  just install ubuntu now
[08:04] <balz> gusx:  the original problem is that my CUPS server won't print .pdf from remote clients so i'm trying to see if missing packages might solve it
[08:04] <simon_b> nlund i got: Xorg   8495   root   11u   CHR   4,64   5727   /dev/ttS0
[08:04] <bpr> person: does it work with your onboard sound?
[08:04] <CrazyDiamond> I need to find out about a live cd with a unix based SO, probably a linux distro, maybe called "lincrack" or "linecrack" or linkcrack"... am i imagining it, or it DOES exists??
[08:04] <nlund> simon_b: it's locked open then
[08:04] <person> bpr: sometimes. right now, i can play rhythmbox, but not much else
[08:05] <rfxcasey> gagita, well thanks anyways
[08:05] <person> not much else = i don't know outside of vlc and youtube vids
[08:05] <bpr> do you mean nothing else?
=== NiaGhost is now known as Niamor
[08:05] <bpr> ok
[08:05] <simon_b> nlund "locked open"? i'm a newbie... sorry
[08:05] <rfxcasey> does anyone know how to use avant window navigator
[08:05] <ShinobiTeno> <unconvertable> bpr you can try pulseaudio, if nothing helps.
[08:05] <bpr> do youtube vids have audio right now?  ... while rhythmbox is playing audio
[08:05] <Brainyiscool> Anyone able to help me get a VNC server up and running without needing to have GNOME logged in all the time?
[08:05] <nlund> simon_b: pretty much it's a matter of stopping/restarting X, or rebooting
[08:06] <nlund> simon_b: at least from what you pasted, since it says that Xorg has it open
[08:06] <person> bpr: nope
[08:06] <bpr> ShinobiTeno: it seems to be an issue with my kernel.  2.6.24-19 is fine, but 2.6.24-21 is not
[08:06] <bpr> ok
[08:06] <bpr> now close firefox
[08:06] <bpr> and close rhythmbox
[08:06] <bpr> then open firefox, and try youtube again
[08:06] <person> k
[08:07] <ShinobiTeno> <unconvertable> bpr maybe alsa gets locked exclusively for every program...
[08:07] <person> still nope
[08:07] <bpr> ShinobiTeno: yeah, that's possible, but why?
[08:07] <bpr> person: ok, your issue doesn't seem to be the same as mine then
[08:07] <balz> gusx:  any idea what the problem might be?
[08:07] <Toipilas> How i can use apache2 offline? I mean i can test my server, but others cant use my server? Only localhost use.
[08:07] <bpr> wait
[08:07] <bpr> are you sure rhythmbox is closed?
[08:07] <ShinobiTeno> <unconvertable> bpr, dunno, just wild guessing.. ask on launchpad?..
[08:07] <bpr> be sure it's not still up in the upper right corner
[08:08] <bpr> you know a little ipod like icon there... to the left of the clock
[08:08] <person> yeah, it's closed
[08:08] <Brainyiscool> Toipilas: You could use an .htaccess file to block it off
[08:08] <bpr> ShinobiTeno: yeah, I haven't done that yet
[08:08] <person> i think tomorrow i'll just take the stupid audigy out and see what happens
[08:08] <bpr> person: ok
[08:08] <bpr> person: sorry i couldn't help

[08:17] <spoon_> happens both on an ubuntu box with intel graphics and on a virtualbox vm running intrepid
[08:17] <rfxcasey> Does anyone know how to get AWN dock to work
[08:17] <spoon_> (on a difft pc)
[08:17] <spoon_> rfxcasey: awn works fine for me, you have to enable desktop effects
[08:18] <spoon_> person, try https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio
[08:18] <Brainyiscool> in your web root, open a file, put that in, and save it as ".htaccess"
=== lipsin_ is now known as lipsin
[08:18] <rfxcasey> spoon_,  I have all that enabled along with desktop cube and what have you but I see no dock
[08:18] <kahnoie> rohan_1  yes...I mean suppose my DSL fails I want my VoIP calls through WLAN but not when DSL is active coz otherwise my voice quality would be affected
[08:19] <spoon_> rfxcasey, do you have any programs running to be in your dock?
[08:19] <rfxcasey> spoon_, well I have xchat running
[08:19] <spoon_> rfxcasy, have you tried the awn manager
[08:19] <rfxcasey> spoon_, of course I have
[08:19] <Brainyiscool> Toipilas: Sorry, I have to go
[08:20] <Toipilas> Brainyiscool: ok, thx
[08:20] <rfxcasey> spoon_, I have it open right now
[08:20] <rohan_1> kahnoie: i see maybe you can try some sort of VoIP client that has failover capabilty
[08:20] <spoon_> rfxcasey, what happens when you close out avast-windown-navigator, open up a terminal, make sure its closed with top, then run it from the command line
[08:21] <spoon_> rfxcasey, in top, type k to kill, then type # of process to kill it (you may already know this)
[08:21] <rfxcasey> spoon_, how do I run it from a command line
[08:21] <spoon_> Applications- Accessories- Terminal
[08:21] <rfxcasey> spoon_, what am I killing again
[08:21] <grigris> #ubuntu-gr
[08:21] <ndlovu> any idea how to tell if DMA is on for my cdrom? hdparm /dev/???
[08:22] <spoon_> rfxcasey, from the prompt, pkill -9 avant-window-navigator should kill everything
[08:22] <rfxcasey> spoon_, I don't understand in top type k to kill
[08:22] <spoon_> rfxcasey, ignore top statement
[08:22] <spoon_> rfxcasey, from the prompt, pkill -9 avant-window-navigator should kill everything
[08:23] <spoon_> rfxcasey@whatever:~$pkill -9 avant-window-navigator
[08:23] <kahnoie> we can look it from two point of view...either configure the VoIP application or configure the internet access to swith to DSL in case the WLAN fails..and its usually the WLAN that fails most of the time..so my internet is blocked and I am unable to troubleshoot as this setup is in the remote location
[08:23] <spoon_> rfxcasey, then type avant-window-navigator, and look for errors
[08:24] <Big_Dick> gain root rights and type "init 0"^^
[08:25] <kahnoie> would my problem be resolved if I used Dynamic DNS or made some kind of modifications to /etc/iproute2/
[08:25] <rfxcasey> spoon_, it just give me a prompt no error message
[08:25] <rfxcasey> spoon_, awn manager is still open
[08:26] <thunderdan> i like ubuntu
[08:26] <rohan_1> kahnoie: yes you can have 2 routes one through DSL and one through WLAN

[08:38] <arooni-mobile> does ubuntu support a umax astra 3400 usb scanner?  i didnt see it in the compatibility wiki.
[08:38] <spoon_> rfxcasey, no idea.  it's possible you could pass it some arguments from the command line, if you cant set that up in the awn manager.  follow that link I gave you to put it in your startup (basically, System \ Preferences\ Sessions - startup programs, but I'm pulling this all out of my ass.  man avant-window-navigator shows no command line options, so if not awn manager, maybe some config file, i dunno
[08:39] <Batsmasher> It's an Atheros

[09:11] <waan> jim_p, nope, I'll tell you when it started happening. I added a new hdd and mounted it as /home in fstab, I made a couple of errors and then the textboot cut in to warn me that some partitions were wrong. So I corrected fstab but it never reverted back to usplash.
[09:11] <jim_p> joseph_: remove the 1st sudo!!!
[09:12] <joseph_> ok
[09:12] <kahnoie> batsmasher: sudo apt-cache search ndis
[09:12] <winking> i   c
[09:12] <moza> about an sd-card : sometimes it mounts automatically, sometimes not...
[09:12] <kahnoie> batsmasher: if this doesnt show you ndis-common then you need to update your package repository
[09:12] <jim_p> waan: reisntall usplash then, or use splashy in its pace
[09:12] <moza> i'm on hardy 8.04 if it can help

[09:13] <moza> are there known problems with SD-cards readers?
[09:13] <waan> jim_p, I'll try reinstalling it
[09:14] <jim_p> moza: i know that several cardreaders built in on laptops dont work *_for certain type of cards_*
[09:14] <moza> oh, ok
[09:14] <waan> jim_p, whatever custom theme I select does actually show up at the pre-loading stage after grub, but it cuts out to text info
[09:14] <jim_p> moza: eg they dont recognise xd cards, although they accept them
[09:14] <jim_p> waan: splashy?
[09:15] <luminerd> Hello, I want to clone a Ubuntu setup to many identical machines.  What options are there to go about this?
[09:15] <blueprotein> i'm also on hardy 8.04 . I cannot find the w32code from google , who can help me? thanks
[09:15] <moza> my card is a SD card "made in taiwan" i don't get to read the trade, and sometimes it mounts other times it doesn't
[09:15] <blueprotein> so I can't play the movies with rmvb format
[09:15] <jim_p> blueprotein: its on medibuntu repo
[09:15] <hateball> Anyone know how to add paths for templates and what not for all users in OpenOffice?
[09:15] <moza> jim_p : is there any forum/site about these problems with sd-cards?
[09:15] <beli> luminerd: if the harddrive partitions are identical....why not backup the whole partition and rewrite it to the new machines?
[09:15] <jim_p> !medibuntu | blueprotein
[09:15] <ubottu> blueprotein: medibuntu is a repository of packages that cannot be included into the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons - See http://www.medibuntu.org
[09:16] <beli> luminerd: this would be software independent then....
[09:16] <luminerd> beli: That's what I'm asking... I want to clone it exactly as is
[09:16] <joseph_> I still have problems installing wine   E: Could not get lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
[09:16] <joseph_> E: Unable to lock the download directory
[09:16] <waan> jim_p, i'll look into that if I cant fix usplash
[09:16] <jim_p> moza: the gentoo wiki just lists what works and what not
[09:16] <Flannel> joseph_: close any other package managers you have open (update-manager, synaptic, other apt-gets, etc)
[09:17] <beli> luminerd: ok there are multiple tools for that.....maybe you want to checkout ultimate boot disc
[09:17] <moza> jim_p, ok, i'll try that to see at least in what category is my card
[09:17] <joseph_> Flannel: thanks, had ultamatix on
[09:17] <Flannel> joseph_: Ooooh
[09:17] <Flannel> joseph_: NOOOOOO, you don't want that.  Get rid of it (even though its already broken your system)
[09:18] <jim_p> moza: you siad its an SD!
[09:18] <joseph_> Flannel: It has already :(
[09:18] <blueprotein> I have try some methods from the google , but none of those are effective
[09:18] <Flannel> joseph_: I suggest reinstall.  Give yourself a system that works, and stay far, far away from *matix.
[09:18] <moza> jim_p, yes i said that, is there something i didn't get?
[09:19] <joseph_> sigh
[09:19] <luminerd> beli: Hmm, is that UBCD? Can't find an "Ultimate boot disc"
[09:19] <luminerd> UBCD doesn't look like what I need though
[09:19] <jim_p> moza: if it works with one SD card, it will work with all SD cards
=== lipsin_ is now known as lipsin
[09:19] <beli> luminerd: wait pls sysrescuecd might be better
[09:19] <jim_p> moza: let me find an example
[09:19] <joseph_> I started from Ubuntu ultimate ... and system died after a few days , now I use ultamatix thought it was a step forward
[09:19] <beli> luminerd: got phone......
[09:20] <luminerd> np :) thanks for your assistance!
[09:20] <Flannel> joseph_: don't do that either.  Use official Ubuntu.  Ultimate edition, ultamatix, are both horrible, horrible hackjobs.
[09:20] <moza> jim_p, ok, i only have one SD card, it worked once or twice, but most of the time it doesn't
[09:20] <indian_munnda> can we run tv from internet using tv tuner card instead of running it through a set top box wire or some thing like that????
[09:20] <jim_p> moza: http://gentoo-wiki.com/HP_Pavilion_dv6850el scroll down and look at a table with the laptops specifications and what works
[09:21] <joseph_> my repositories is real mess.. If I could just sort them...
[09:21] <jim_p> indian_munnda: like use a tv card?
[09:21] <joseph_> the apps that appear in synaptic do not appear in add/remove
[09:22] <Flannel> joseph_: Just reinstall.  There's no way to get rid of the damage from ultamatix.
[09:22] <Flannel> joseph_: Also, add/remove isn't as comprehensive as synaptic, and never was designed to be.
[09:22] <jim_p> ...and i got disconnected
=== rraphink is now known as raphink
[09:22] <indian_munnda> jim_p: i have it and i have already conneted it to the pci.
[09:22] <jim_p> did i miss something?
[09:22] <joseph_> ok.... :(
[09:23] <jim_p> indian_munnda: so what is the problem?
[09:23] <indian_munnda> jim_p: no didn't
[09:23] <indian_munnda> missed
[09:23] <jim_p> ?
[09:23] <joseph_> just one thing... is there any way to create a ghost with linux like in acronis image for windows?
[09:23] <jim_p> joseph_: clonezilla
[09:23] <indian_munnda> jim_p: problem is that i want to start tv from the internet if it is possible can u tell me how to do that
[09:24] <joseph_> cool thanks
[09:24] <joseph_> ok.. off to    17th re-installation might fet lucky
=== samba is now known as Guest74272
[09:26] <moza> jim_p : ok, i checked on the page. it seems the sd card reader is supported on other laptops and was not tested on mine on this wiki
[09:26] <moza> my laptop is : http://gentoo-wiki.com/HP_Compaq_nx8220
[09:27] <jim_p> moza: give me a sec please
[09:27] <zplash> is there a way to get a rightclick menu with rounded corners for gnome?
[09:28] <ameenoz> hey
[09:28] <moza> jim_p : sorry, take your time, there is no rush
[09:28] <ameenoz> im new here
[09:28] <ameenoz> im a kubuntu user kcd
[09:28] <kalpa_> hi
[09:29] <kalpa_> I'm using Ubuntu
[09:29] <ameenoz> hi
[09:29] <_coredump_> moinsen
[09:29] <beli> luminerd: back...http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page
[09:29] <beli> luminerd: Partimage is what i used once....
[09:29] <luminerd> I was just looking at Partimage
[09:30] <ameenoz> i dont know how to get a sceme :(
[09:30] <zplash> sceme?
[09:31] <ameenoz> theme
[09:31] <ameenoz> yea
[09:31] <zplash> www.gnomelook.org
[09:31] <beli> luminerd: you need to save your partitionizing data using fdisk/cfdisk to a file...then reproduce the partition on the new system...and then copy over the data...thats all...Partimage splits files into 2GB parts to take care of filesystem limitations...
[09:31] <LonelyRacer> guys i need help to connecting to wpa wireless, i cant connect at all
[09:31] <maco> im trying to use ubuntu-vm-builder in hardy to create an intrepid vm. it doesn't like that. anyone know how to make u-v-b aware of intrepid?
[09:32] <beli> luminerd: sysrescuecd is what you need :)
[09:32] <luminerd> beli: I read over that, not sure how it will help me?
[09:33] <Ace_NoOne> hi there - where can I find out when Python 2.6 will become the default in Ubuntu?
[09:33] <luminerd> I find it rather unbelievable that this isn't trivial :/
