[02:07] <Corey>  I have an apache-2 server and its really strict and stuff how can I let dreamweaver 8 write files to it ?
[02:07] <spikeb> why is it that redhat is the only one who's come close to making a meta-desktop distro work decently?
[02:07] <shriphani> then it should be detected all the while
[02:07] <Sub> shriphani, fstab is only ran on boot and on mount -a

[03:02] <Jimmey__> Why

[03:02] <Sub> that was why i like it so much.
[03:03] <Sub> true.
[03:03] <spikeb> yum is comparable to apt.
[03:03] <spikeb> (and sucks in comparison)
[03:03] <Sub> ahh, suse has a thing liek apt
[03:03] <Sub> YUM thats it.

They are currently using a windows box running kerio mail server and kerio firewall. The solution is not working as they are getting very large phone bills and the mail is unreliable. i am going

I normally use this for Small ADSL clients but have never set-up a solution to control ISDN dial-ups and restrict call charges. It would be an added bonus if I could control users dialing up by forcing them to use some type ofauthentication proxy. any ideas?

[03:34] <power1> another_lemur, thanks....I will get reading.
[03:34] <Healot> HumanPrototype: apt-get -f install if you were talking about broken installation
[03:34] <another_lemur> power1, and you can control which users are allowed to use it, therefore limiting who can connect

[04:07] <VitaminG> drew: if you've used it in windows, don't expect the same thing.
[04:07] <VitaminG> drew: just search for it in synaptic

[04:10] <VitaminG> mantiz: for edonkey, use synaptic to find amule. it's a cross-platform edonkey client. It works great. or if you want to do it in command line, I think the package is called amule.
[04:10] <nickrud> drew, have you enabled the multiverse repository?
[04:10] <nickrud> drew, and the universe?
[04:10] <VitaminG> drew: are you using breezy
[04:10] <drew> I think so
[04:10] <drew> Im using 5.10 I think thats breezy
[04:10] <s00ty> Hi guys. I'm trying to get WG311v1 up. However, it's not listed in ifconfig. In device manager, I can see it is recognised as being plugged in. How do I use it?
[04:10] <drew> how can I check it its on multiverse

[04:12] <nickrud> drew, there are several ways, the easiest for me is to ask you to type in a terminal   grep universe /etc/apt/sources.list , does that line have a # at the beginning?
