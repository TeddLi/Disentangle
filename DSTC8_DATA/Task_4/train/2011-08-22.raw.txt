[11:21] <m_fulder> glebihan when I do sudo nullmailer-send I only get Rescanning queue. and it loads forever :P
[11:22] <spo0kz> Does anybody here manage to use virtualbox without compromising your cpu usage  ?
[11:22] <extor> If I want my mailserver to reside on mail.mydomain.com but I also want to be able to send mail to *@mydomina.com and *@client.mydomain.com and *@support.mydomain.com then how do I do the MX and CNAME and A entries for mydomain.com to reflect all that?
[11:23] <rumpe1> spo0kz, define "compromising"
[11:23] <monty156> you can all relax, im back now lol
[11:23] <ActionParsnip> spo0kz: depends on your spec, you can always tell virtualbox to use less CPU (I believe). I suggest you ask in #vbox too
[11:23] <spo0kz> rumpe1,  anything over 50% while the virtual guest is idle
[11:24] <spo0kz> ActionParsnip,  been to #vbox sent logs had it out for good hour or two, no joy
[11:24] <vkushner> I need to apt-get update an old jaunty server but all the sources seem to be gone... where can I get a sources.list for jaunty?
[11:24] <ActionParsnip> spo0kz: which version of virtualbox?
[11:25] <spo0kz> ActionParsnip, 4.1.2
[11:25] <rumpe1> !jaunty
[11:25] <ubottu> Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) was the tenth release of Ubuntu. End Of Life: October 23, 2010. See !eol and !upgrade for more details.
[11:25] <ActionParsnip> vkushner: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=997890
[11:25] <rumpe1> vkushner, jaunty is dead
[11:25] <wolfric> i have a strange issue with the screen not updating sometimes. I'm not exactly sure on what level it is. So if i change workspace and then try type in a terminal or a text editor or even do something in the browser, the image stays still and i can't see anything. if i just do alt tab (even if there aren't any other windows) the changes start appearing and it's fine from then onwards
[11:26] <wolfric> it doesn't always happen though. i'd say every 15/20 mins?
[11:26] <ActionParsnip> wolfric: is your video chip onboard or is it on a dedicated video card?
[11:26] <vkushner> rumpe1: well, duh! I know its officially dead. this doesn't change the fact that I got this client with a couple years old jaunty server and I just need to install some package.
[11:27] <glebihan> m_fulder, I think you have to use nullmailer-queue then nullmailer-send, once again you should have a look at the manpages, also for it to work in php, you may have to edit your php.ini file and set the sendmail_path to "sendmail -t -i -f<name>@<domain>"
[11:27] <wolfric> ActionParsnip: onboard nvidia and i have the restricted drivers
[11:27] <ActionParsnip> vkushner: the jaunty servers are all off, you won't be able to get any packages online
[11:27] <vkushner> so the question is still: is there any place still hosting old jaunty repo?
[11:27] <ActionParsnip> wolfric: have you tested your RAM?
[11:27] <sipior> vkushner: which package? might be easier just to install from source at this point.
[11:27] <ActionParsnip> vkushner: very very unlikely
[11:27] <wolfric> ActionParsnip: no, you mean with a memtest right?
[11:28] <ActionParsnip> wolfric: yes, in Grub
[11:28] <wolfric> ActionParsnip: i seriously doubt there's a problem there but sure i'll give it a shot next time
[11:28] <wolfric> ActionParsnip: any other ideas in the mean time
[11:28] <KcGenesis> hello i am new .please any can help me what is this about
[11:28] <vkushner> sipior: no, thats a whole server configuration script that is running and failing.
[11:28] <rumpe1> vkushner, what's the point? jaunty isn't even LTS.
[11:28] <ActionParsnip> pretty cool link: http://www.sourceslist.eu/tag/jaunty/
[11:28] <spo0kz> ActionParsnip, i get high cpu usage with vmware and virtualbox, what could that mean ?
[11:28] <ActionParsnip> KcGenesis: this channel is for support. That's what it is about
[11:29] <sipior> vkushner: configuration script? we were talking about software packages, as i recall...
[11:29] <ActionParsnip> spo0kz: what speed etc is your CPU?
[11:29] <vkushner> sipior: well, there is this server configuration script that as part of its running does apt-get update and then tries to install some packages
[11:29] <spo0kz> ActionParsnip, its perfectly capable, its an i3 2.9ghz i run 3gb of ram

[11:33] <KcGenesis> ActionParsnip, how does this chat actually works
=== Roberto35 is now known as Richard|
[11:34] <ActionParsnip> spo0kz: hmm, not sure then personally, maybe others can advise. Have you tried a light OS like xpud/puppy etc, see if it happens there
[11:34] <spo0kz> rumpe1, ubuntu is 11.04 vbox is 4.1.2 nothing fancy going on here lol
[11:34] <ActionParsnip> KcGenesis: you are doing it now. You ask a support question. If people can help they will reply
[11:34] <m_fulder> glebihan ok I have now read through the docs for nullmailer-queue and nullmailer-send .. I have also added the -f flag to my php.ini .. but I don't get one thing in the nullmailer-queue doc. there is written I should terminate all lines with single line-feed character? Which one is that?
[11:34] <spo0kz> ActionParsnip, yeah man its frustrating, something is conflicting somwhere
[11:35] <rumpe1> spo0kz, afair there are some options with warnings in virtualbox (3d-acceleration, etc.) which maybe cause problems. Try to deactivate as much stuff as possible and try again.
[11:35] <spo0kz> rumpe1, tried it all
[11:36] <ActionParsnip> spo0kz: try disabling stuff like ACPI and APIC in the vbox config
[11:36] <glebihan> m_fulder, it is the "\n" character
[11:36] <rumpe1> spo0kz, well... do you think it's a hardware-specific problem?
[11:36] <m_fulder> glebihan you mean a simple line break?
[11:36] <spo0kz> rumpe1, no, most definitely not
[11:37] <glebihan> m_fulder, yes
[11:37] <KcGenesis> how to know which software is installed in ubuntu.?software that mostly run from terminal.
[11:37] <m_fulder> glebihan cause when I as in the documentation of nullmailer-queue write: senderAddress-ENTER-reciptienist-ENTER-ENTER-message-ENTER .. nothing happends :S
[11:38] <ActionParsnip> KcGenesis: how do you mean?
[11:38] <ActionParsnip> KcGenesis: you can run all comamnds from terminal, some will just spawn graphical applications
[11:38] <glebihan> m_fulder, well I won't be able to help you much more with nullmailer as I've never used it, but why do you want to use it anyway instead of sendmail
[11:38] <glebihan> ?
[11:39] <glebihan> m_fulder, I've been googling a bit on it and nullmailer does seem very php-friendly
[11:39] <glebihan> does *not* seem
[11:40] <KcGenesis> ActionParsnip, i mean which application doesnot have GUI and doesnot show up in menu .
[11:40] <m_fulder> glebihan aha weird :S maybe I should try sendmail instead then
[11:41] <glebihan> m_fulder, I would recommend it anyway
[11:41] <m_fulder> glebihan btw how can I just unlink nullmailer from sendmail now :P ?

[11:42] <glebihan> m_fulder, just delete /usr/sbin/sendmail
[11:42] <ActionParsnip> KcGenesis: thats a LOT of commands, what do you want to achieve?
[11:42] <ActionParsnip> orated: can you give a pastebin of the output of:  lsb_release -a; sudo apt-get update
[11:43] <KcGenesis> ActionParsnip, i want to know which commands are there to run. or installed
[11:44] <rumpe1> KcGenesis, dpkg --get-selections | grep '[^e]install$' | cut -f 1 | less
[11:44] <ActionParsnip> KcGenesis: Its very ambiguous dude
[11:44] <spo0kz> rumpe1, if vmware and virtualbox are producing the same problem, what on gods earth could that mean to you ?
[11:44] <ActionParsnip> rumpe1: s/he wants the ones which don't fire a GUI app
[11:45] <glebihan> rumpe1, that'll give package names not commands
[11:46] <rumpe1> KcGenesis, what problem do you want to solve (effectively) or it this more a theoretical question?
[11:46] <spo0kz> rumpe1, could it have been the kernel update that recently came through ?
[11:47] <rumpe1> KcGenesis, i really have absolutely no idea, in which situations such a list would be helpful
[11:48] <rumpe1> spo0kz, maybe. You could try older kernels, if you have any.
[11:48] <KcGenesis> rumpe1, not actually few month ago i installed a security application and i can't remember its name and and i have no idea how find it that why.
[11:49] <glebihan> KcGenesis, what was that application doing ?
[11:50] <rumpe1> KcGenesis, well... you could search with "apropos <term>"  with word=security or something relevant  ... or "aptitude search <term>", or "apt-cache search <term>"...

[11:53] <spo0kz> rumpe1, well luckily this is all set up on an external hard drive, i use clonezilla but only have a clone of this new kernel update, might try reinstalling ubuntu and see if it still lags idk, seems like alot of work just to play poker

[11:56] <rumpe1> spo0kz, grub stores per default more than one kernel... except you have customized the config.
[11:56] <orated> ActionParsnip: http://pastebin.com/pNwyrYd6 . I don't see it on update but on upgrades followed by installation
[11:56] <spo0kz> rumpe1, yeah clonezilla did that right
[11:56] <spo0kz> rumpe1, im running of a restore as i stand
[11:56] <KcGenesis> thanks guys it worked..one thing what is difference between "aptitude search<term>" and "apt-cache search"
[11:57] <ActionParsnip> orated: can youu pastebin the output of:  sudo apt-get upgrade    please
[11:57] <spo0kz> brb commiting suicide
[11:58] <rumpe1> KcGenesis, aptitude is a higher level interface to APT than apt-cache, which only queries the cache, but apt-cache is faster.

[12:11] <auronandace> !latest | Night-Hacks
[12:11] <ubottu> Night-Hacks: Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea.

[12:27] <wildbat> prodigel:  you lost me ~ i said to remove it
[12:27] <japan> how to delete all without asking ?
[12:27] <bazhang> japan, delete what
[12:27] <antony> bazhang, what ?
[12:27] <japan> every thing, i know there is some code for deleteing everything without asking
[12:28] <iridium> japan, lets say you want delete a directory, rm -rf directory/
[12:28] <bazhang> antony, you want to convert without re-encoding; how do you propose to do that
[12:28] <antony> bazhang, i want to keep h264, but simply reduce the resolution
[12:28] <prodigel> wildbat, never mind, it was just smalltalk. Thanks for the help anyway!
[12:28] <ActionParsnip> japan: you can use gparted to format partitions easily, is that what you mean?
[12:28] <antony> bazhang, ok for reencoding
[12:29] <wildbat> japan: everything? as the whole harddrive? whole folder? whole ...errr world?
[12:30] <japan> but ye
[12:30] <japan> yes
[12:30] <Pici> 08:27:15 <?japan> how to delete all without asking ?
[12:30] <Pici> (sorry)
[12:30] <bazhang> japan, use gparted then
[12:32] <ActionParsnip> antony: try mencoder, or maybe handbrake can do it
[12:32] <kyle_> Qucick command to eject Cd-ROM ??
[12:32] <kyle_> *quick
[12:33] <Pici> kyle_: 'eject'
[12:33] <japan> i cummed on dead bird
[12:33] <antony> i think this is a good command: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s 1280x720 output.mp4
[12:33] <overclucker> antony: ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -sameq -aspect 16:9 out.mp4
[12:34] <antony> ha no it is mp4 now...
[12:34] <kyle_> pici: unable to eject, last error: Input/output error
[12:34] <antony> overclucker, where is resolution in your command ?
[12:35] <overclucker> the aspect ratio 16:9 = 1280x720
[12:35] <LABcrab> Hello everyone!  i can't boot from a real CD.  Can i boot from an ISO using GRUB2 instead?  Please let me know.
[12:37] <alks> Hello
[12:37] <ActionParsnip> LABcrab: yes you can. Did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
[12:39] <branant> Pici (japan), You need to learn the basics of Linux/Unix before abusing dead birds.
[12:39] <LABcrab> ActionParsnip: Pretty sure.
[12:39] <LABcrab> ActionParsnip: To double check, how is it done?
[12:39] <ActionParsnip> LABcrab: you either did or didn't, it's a concious process
[12:39] <ActionParsnip> !md5 | LABcrab
[12:39] <ubottu> LABcrab: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[12:39] <LABcrab> ActionParsnip: Why do people do this?
[12:40] <ActionParsnip> LABcrab: so that you know the file you have is complete and consistent
[12:40] <Feldegast> LABcrab to confirm the downloaded iso is error free
[12:40] <LABcrab> Fair enough.
[12:40] <ActionParsnip> LABcrab: you clearly didn't check it
[12:40] <LABcrab> How fast is it?
[12:41] <ActionParsnip> LABcrab: as fast as your PC, takes a few seconds
[12:41] <LABcrab> Sorry.  :(  i usually don't.
[12:41] <ActionParsnip> LABcrab: you should
[12:41] <LABcrab> ActionParsnip: Why can't, say, Opera do this automatically?  i'm guessing there's a Fx add-on?
[12:41] <alks> i get a very interesting boot problem with ubuntu with lots of back history of how i got where i am now .. i have dual boot win7 and ubuntu. if i start PC in WIN7 and then shut down PC and launch again to win 7 everything is fine. IF i restart o launch at first to ubuntu and then SHUTDOWN from ubuntu i get bios startup crash/restart and  i am able to boot to win7or ubuntu again from grub. If I REBOOT from ubuntu i can boot to ubuntu with no problem but if i try
[12:41] <alks>  WIN7 it crashes on login screen. i updated my bios (did not help) and have no idea what to do next as i can not find any more info
[12:41] <Somelauw> Any xrdb experts here?
[12:42] <LABcrab> 8b1085bed498b82ef1485ef19074c281.  Yes, it's good to go.  But how does it work, and why the cryptic code?  ActionParsnip & Feldegast
[12:43] <ActionParsnip> LABcrab: possibly, torrents add extra error checks
[12:43] <Feldegast> LABcrab i have not seen a firefox add-on
[12:43] <ActionParsnip> LABcrab: it calculates some values based on the data within the file. When you boot the CD, do you get a black screen?
[12:44] <LABcrab> So now the check is done.  Why does it say "bed" in the check?  Where do we go from here?
[12:44] <LABcrab> ActionParsnip: The computer is unable to boot from CD, and probably doesn't even detect the drive(s).
[12:44] <alks> hello?

[12:53] <LABcrab> Feldegast: What is k3b?  Text-based?
[12:53] <ylmfos> just consider it ubuntu, for 3.0 is kind of purely ubuntu, just some themes and stuff like that :) ...
[12:53] <Guest95319> 3G to edge and edge to 3G .....?
[12:54] <ylmfos> what can i do?... terminal stuff, or whatever?...
[12:54] <Feldegast> LABcrab k3b is a cd buyrning application for linux
[12:54] <Guest12234> yeah, got it !
[12:54] <LABcrab> Guest95319: Move away from the edge or else you will fall!
[12:54] <ActionParsnip> ylmfos: it's not supported here, this is ubuntu support only. The multitude of other spinoffs are equally not supported here

[12:55] <Feldegast> LABcrab if you want to boot the 700mb iso from usb a 2gb usb is big enough
[12:55] <LABcrab> Guest95319: Go to the network icon, modify connexions.
[12:55] <ActionParsnip> ylmfos: mint isn't supported here either
[12:55] <ylmfos> i understand...
[12:55] <ActionParsnip> ylmfos: thanks
[12:55] <tsimpson> ylmfos: we have no clue what changes were/wern't made to ylmf, so we wouldn't know how to help anyway
[12:56] <Guest12234> ylmfos is a nick of someone
[12:56] <ylmfos> can you at least give me some ubuntu konsole cmds to check if it detects somehow the hdd, just that i didn't find them?...
[12:56] <LABcrab> Guest95319: When you modify your connexions you can change it to 2G only.
[12:56] <Jensit> xubuntu is supported here right?
[12:56] <LABcrab> Jensit: #xubuntu
[12:56] <ActionParsnip> Jensit: yes, it is an official canonical release
[12:56] <Guest12234> possibly
[12:56] <Jensit> okay thanks :)
[12:56] <Feldegast> ylmfos if it is mounted, then you can use df -h
[12:57] <ylmfos> no, it is not mounted. i mean something like fdisk or dd ...
[12:57] <LABcrab> Jensit: No worries.  :)  #ubuntu is good if it's not xubuntu-specific, but Xubuntu's been bloaty over the years.
[12:57] <tsimpson> ylmfos: in general, look for /dev/sd*, and "sudo fdisk -l" to list all disks and partitions

[12:57] <winut> is amarok worth installing? thanks

[12:58] <Guest95319> LABcrab
[12:58] <winut> wow, thanks :-)

[12:58] <overclucker> Guest12234: oh fir xchat it's: /server irc.linuxfromscratch.org
[12:58] <LABcrab> Guest95319: Have you changed the settings so that it does 2G only or 3G only?
[12:58] <Guest95319> Yes
[12:58] <Guest12234> let me see

[13:01] <alks> cameron_,  try boot-repair
[13:01] <ActionParsnip> Guest95319: sure, as long as it and all it's dependencies are installed
[13:01] <Guest95319> Thanx
[13:01] <ylmfos> you think it will detect the hdd?... :) 'cause i`d try that if so :)
[13:01] <ylmfos> also, i have a dual core with 2 gb ram, which version of ubuntu you recommend?...
[13:01] <ActionParsnip> ylmfos: i'd say try it
[13:02] <Guest95319> OpenCV can be cross compiled for an arm processor

[13:02] <alks> cameron_,  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[13:02] <ActionParsnip> ylmfos: using spinoffs like that isn't too smart. The community for Ubuntu dwarfs any other, and I'm sure you want good support from more users...

[13:11] <chroot> VictorCl2, can u tell me what you want to do
[13:11] <VictorCl2> to do about what?
[13:11] <chroot> means , your problem
[13:12] <VictorCl2> ahh. well update manager tells me that
[13:12] <VictorCl2> Requires installation of untrusted packages
[13:12] <VictorCl2> I dont know what to do
[13:12] <chroot> oh  , maybe you want to update your sys , and the issue occurs
[13:13] <chroot> right?
[13:13] <VictorCl2> no the update manager pop ups telling me that there are updates
[13:13] <VictorCl2> when I click .. Update .. it tells me that
[13:13] <chroot> i have met them before
[13:14] <chroot> first , type this command  in a console

[13:14] <chroot> this will refresh your source list
[13:15] <chroot> it is safe

[13:15] <auronandace> LABcrab: to prevent people flooding the channel
[13:15] <hiwk> if anyone answers my question (force re-draw of unity bar), please higlight me
[13:16] <chroot> i'd like to
[13:16] <chroot> hiwk , tell me how highlight you
[13:16] <cameron_> I see the bit where it is finding OSs, and it simply doesn't SEE windows at all
[13:16] <hiwk> chroot: like that :)
[13:16] <cameron_> however, i can pick it out of the /sda/1 things
[13:16] <chroot> let me try
[13:16] <chroot> hiwk:
[13:17] <chroot> not work , as you see
[13:17] <chroot> hiwk:)
[13:17] <hiwk> chroot: what?
[13:17] <LABcrab> lol auronandace.
[13:17] <chroot> ok , tell me what is your problem

[13:17] <chroot> here
[13:17] <alks> cameron_,  sry i am not expert :/ when i had problems with dual boot, i played with boot repair and it fixed everything
[13:18] <cameron_> alks: bummer - thanks
[13:18] <hiwk> chroot: I suspect that it really is a nvidia driver problem, but it seems easier to mtigiate than to fix
[13:18] <Jensit> hiwk: give me a sec i think i found something on ubuntuusers.de
[13:18] <chroot> and what problem u enconter
[13:18] <auronandace> LABcrab: what's so funny?
[13:19] <auronandace> LABcrab: flooding the channel with text (sometimes bots spam the channel)
[13:19] <cameron_> Can anyone help make windows appear on boot menu? http://paste.ubuntu.com/672430/
[13:20] <chroot> hiwk, is that when you login x window , the desktop can't be represent imeadiately
[13:20] <chroot> cameron,
[13:20] <doriad> I just installed 11.04 and there doesn't seem to be a package named kde4-devel - anyone know what it might be called?
[13:20] <chroot> are u there
[13:20] <cameron_> yeah
[13:20] <hiwk> doriad: why do you want that?
[13:21] <chroot> so , what is your ubuntu version
[13:21] <doriad> I am getting "ERROR: Could not find KDE4 kde4-config" when configuring kdevplatform
[13:21] <wsagent> How can I install tweetDeck on ubuntu 10.10
[13:21] <cameron_> chroot: 11.04
[13:22] <chroot> cameron_, are u install the ubuntu first on your computer
[13:22] <hiwk> doriad: 'apt-file search kde4-config0 willl give you kdelibs-bin'
[13:23] <chroot> wsagent, download tweet through the internet explore
[13:23] <hiwk> doriad: hm, I failed that paste :)  executing 'apt-file search kde4-config' will point you to the package 'kdelibs-bin'
[13:23] <Pici> wsagent: Install the adobeair package, and then download the tweetdeck air app from their website.
[13:23] <cameron_> chroot: yes
[13:23] <etfb> Is there a way to tell if ACPI is working properly on my laptop?  I suspect it isn't, which is why many things are currently not working.
[13:23] <tsimpson> doriad: why not just install kdevelop?
[13:23] <wsagent> Thanks Pici and Chroot
[13:23] <chroot> cameron_, and u install the windows afterward
[13:24] <cameron_> chroot: oh no, Windows was first, ubuntu came afterwards
[13:24] <doriad> tsimpson, there are very recent patches that I need
[13:24] <chroot> cameron_, and in the grub list when booting , there is no windows entry

[13:25] <chroot> am i right
[13:25] <chroot> cameron_,
[13:25] <tsimpson> doriad: you probably want to make sure you have kdebase-workspace-dev installed then
[13:25] <cameron_> chroot: there is no windows entry
[13:25] <hiwk> Jensit: did yyou find anything?
[13:25] <Jensit> hiwk: just some spam posts -.-' got many stuff to search through ^^
[13:25] <tsimpson> doriad: and probably some boost stuff too

[13:29] <etfb> Is there a way to tell if ACPI is working properly on my laptop?  I suspect it isn't, which is why many things are currently not working.
[13:29] <rocket16> Is there an easy process to use the Maverick kernel in Natty? (Natty kernel isn't working well with my USB modem and sound, and maverick was indeed well). I mean, without changing the sources to Maverick sources
[13:29] <chroot> the same situation , the first os in my computer is windows , and later i installed the ubuntu  too . but in my grub list , that is ok .
[13:30] <cameron_> chroot: any ideas?
[13:30] <chroot> yeah
[13:31] <chroot> there is a grub.cfg in /etc
[13:31] <chroot> if you want to add a entry for win  , u need edit this file
[13:31] <chroot> just add a windows entry  in this file
[13:32] <auronandace> chroot: grub.cfg shouldn't be edited directly
[13:32] <bazhang> chroot, thats not correct
[13:32] <cameron_> yeah
[13:32] <cameron_> and i already wrote the function
[13:32] <bazhang> !grub2 | chroot please have a read
[13:32] <ubottu> chroot please have a read: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[13:32] <auronandace> chroot: you either want /etc/default/grub or the individual files in /etc/grub.d/
[13:32] <chroot> i know , the offical  document said too ,
[13:32] <cameron_> i wrote a function to add it.. and it looks like it does.. but then i get "signuatre reror"
[13:33] <cameron_> I added an individual file to /etc/grub.d
[13:33] <bazhang> chroot, the wiki says do not edit that directly, very explicitly
[13:33] <cameron_> can someone just tell me what the proper (hd0,x) code is given my pastebin?
[13:33] <cameron_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/672420/

[13:35] <cameron_> this is my windows partitoin
[13:35] <cameron_> it's the second one down and has a asterisk under BOOT
[13:35] <cameron_> is that (hd0,1) or (hd0,2) (regardless, I already tried both of those

[13:38] <csu010245> I have a running printer - works fine with lp - I need to send things directly to it, I assumed I could just send to /dev/lp0 but this is not the case, how do I do it
[13:38] <chroot> cameron, there is a one way , find a ubuntu livecd , using it , and reboot your sys , and then fix your grub right
[13:39] <zagibu> i think (hd0,1) should be correct in your case for sda2
[13:40] <chroot> hi, who knows how to forbidden  network when booting ,
[13:41] <chroot> i want my computer boot faster
[13:41] <chroot> faster is best
[13:41] <auronandace> chroot: how fast does it boot now?
[13:41] <chroot> ha ,about 44
[13:41] <chroot> how about it ,
[13:42] <chroot> i heard that ubuntu is faster
[13:42] <chroot> but , in my situation , it is the same as windows
[13:43] <chroot> auronandance , got any idea
[13:43] <auronandace> chroot: 44 seconds sounds reasonable to me
[13:44] <chroot> i want it faster , about 30
[13:44] <voxcroix> :)
[13:45] <markitoxs> hi there, anyone knows why an ssh session would become completely unresponsive after executing certain commands (as in "top","history" )... speed is not an issue as the machines are on our own network

[13:49] <chroot> a good media player?
[13:49] <chroot> for what
[13:49] <auronandace> !latest | silverarrow
[13:49] <ubottu> silverarrow: Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.
[13:49] <auronandace> chroot: to play media files
[13:49] <skim1776> did anyone has problem with endless boot from usb drive?
[13:49] <silverarrow> latest VLC are major upgrades, but bug fixes
[13:50] <chroot> oh , i remember , like gnome mplayer
[13:50] <chroot> thanks auronandace]

[13:52] <chroot> en? mine  21:44
[13:52] <chroot> funny uh
[13:52] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: there is a 1.1.11 PPA
[13:52] <silverarrow> in package manager?
[13:52] <silverarrow> I have been looking
[13:52] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: what is the output of:  lsb_release -c
[13:52] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: you'll need a 3rd party ppa
[13:52] <chroot> markitoxs, i think there is something in your ssh config file , read it ,
[13:53] <silverarrow> clever Parsnip
[13:53] <chroot> markitoxs, and also search ssh with ubuntu in google
[13:53] <silverarrow> !!
[13:53] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: what is the output of the command I gave?
[13:53] <markitoxs> chroot, the host machine you mean? because i am trying to ssh from different  machines and still experiencing the same issue, so i assume its the host that has a problem
[13:54] <silverarrow> natty
[13:54] <silverarrow> ActionParsnip natty
[13:54] <chroot> yes , ssh server is on host , and u shoul check out host
[13:54] <Ramses> you welcome

[13:54] <dreich> silverarrow, I agree.  ActionParsnip natty.
[13:55] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: I can suggest ditching VLC (unless you need one of it's features) and use gnome-mplayer
[13:56] <chroot> yeah , gnom mplayer is great
[13:56] <chroot> Ramses, hi
[13:57] <silverarrow> ActionParsnip, something is happening !!
[13:58] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: read the screen, you can see the version being installed
[13:58] <silverarrow> ActionParsnip, I would, but in my experience gnome can't handle everything, so I go for both Gone and vlc
[13:59] <chroot> ActionParsnip, are u installed vlc the same time
[13:59] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: same, I only use vlc for the remote control via my Android phone
[13:59] <ActionParsnip> chroot: sure why not :)
[13:59] <zagibu> chroot: if you want it even faster, get an SSD
[13:59] <chroot> ActionParsnip,  i just wonder.

[14:02] <ActionParsnip> JWelch: afternoon
[14:03] <vtt4> JWelch, morning
[14:03] <chroot> bazhang, ssd , is hardware , need but it
[14:03] <chroot> right
[14:03] <JWelch> So this morning, my Empathy client's contact list is empty. I can chat with folks, so I'm connected, but nothing appears.
[14:03] <bazhang> chroot, chat in #ubuntu-offtopic Ubuntu support only here.
[14:04] <JWelch> Have rebooted, killed/restarted Empathy, and searched, but haven't found a fix - is this the right place to check on that?
[14:04] <silverarrow> ActionParsnip: was I suppose to get VLC 1.1.11? darn, I still have 1.1.09
[14:05] <skim1776> is it possible to install full OS from liveCD?
[14:05] <silverarrow> yes
[14:05] <zamba> i have an old fx5200 graphic card.. it has dvi, vga and tv-out.. does it support dual screen? does anyone know?
[14:05] <silverarrow> skim1776, yes
[14:06] <silverarrow> skim1776, it is pretty much identical, just following the install guide from desktop, at least in Ubuntu
=== RA_drc_ is now known as RA_drc
[14:07] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: restart the app
[14:07] <vtt4> JWelch, why don't you use another program instead of Empathy?
[14:07] <skim1776> I have endless loop while boot - the sign is "automatic boot will be in 10"...9 - 0 then again from 10 to 0
[14:07] <JWelch> vtt4 - I could, but I like Empathy's integration into the OS
[14:07] <ActionParsnip> skim1776: is that on the liveCD or has the CD not booted yet?
[14:07] <skim1776> I install from usb drive
[14:07] <Dans326> Im looking for a way to clone a hard drive of a networked windows  computer with a ubuntu server and then restore it later via network boot is this possible?
[14:08] <silverarrow> <ActionParsnip, I have, maybe I need to reboot
[14:08] <skim1776> it's not livecd but minimal-iso
[14:08] <ActionParsnip> skim1776: ok, did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
[14:08] <JWelch> So, to answer the question more directly, personal preference. It's worked for over a year, so I'm curious as to what may have changed over the weekend.
[14:08] <skim1776> yes, md5 is the same as in the repository
[14:08] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: for a media player, not at all
[14:08] <matariel> does empathy work with a skype account?
[14:08] <silverarrow> <ActionParsnip, I have to do some thinking then, hmm
[14:08] <Pici> matariel: Not to my knowledge.
[14:08] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: what is the output of:  apt-cache policy vlc     us a pastebin to hold the text
[14:09] <ActionParsnip> skim1776: is the system set to boot USB first?
[14:09] <vtt4> materiel, i don't think so
[14:09] <auronandace> matariel: no, only skype does
[14:09] <lestat> hi folks
[14:09] <auronandace> matariel: skype is closed source
[14:10] <skim1776> ActionParsnip, of couse, the process is being started but then endless loop goes
[14:10] <vtt4> JWelch, do you know emesene?
[14:10] <lestat> it seems the command add-apt-repository is broken concerning proxy etc. I'm trying to use it over a socks proxy but it just fails as you can see here http://pastebin.com/vmFjQ5n1
[14:10] <TheMatrix3000> Anyone here using NFSv4 on Ubuntu Server, and is able to explain to me what would be involved in migrating NFSv3 to NFSv4?
[14:10] <lestat> any clue about that problem ?
[14:10] <mah454> Gnome3 or KDE-4.7 for Laptop ?
[14:10] <JWelch> Had not looked into it, vtt4
[14:10] <JWelch> Will go poke about a bit
[14:11] <ActionParsnip> lestat: do you use a proxy?
[14:11] <auronandace> mah454: why not xfce? lxde? enlightenment?

[14:11] <bazhang> LABcrab, try ##windows

[14:18] <Roken> Uber lightweight, and I use it on my laptop
[14:18] <ActionParsnip> mah454: depends which apps you intend to use, if you use more KDE apps then use KDE, if you use Gnome apps then use Gnome
[14:18] <rypervenche> I agree. Unity and KDE are not my type. Xfce or Gnone 2.x

[14:21] <silverarrow> Dans326, really weird
[14:22] <ActionParsnip> rypervenche: but then you can't say you prefer gnome 2.x ...makes no sense
[14:22] <rypervenche> ActionParsnip: Gnome 2.x without Unity, I sure can.
[14:23] <hobbel> hey there, i completely destroyed my wifi capability's. How can i restore it to the default drivers etc. Tried to get ndiswrapper running due to slow wifi speed bug (Intel 3945) but right now I have no wifi at all
[14:23] <silverarrow> ActionParsnip; worked !!!!
[14:23] <ActionParsnip> rypervenche: unity desktop which is installed i Ubuntu USES gnome 2, it just has the extra shell. You need a DE to be running to get Unity, the default DE is Gnome 2.x in Natty
[14:23] <ActionParsnip> silverarrow: cool
[14:23] <silverarrow> Dans326 : something is definitely messing up
[14:24] <Dans326> silverarrow so Ive basically given up on figuring out what she is doing to it and just looking for a quick fix for it. So is there a way to just install everything and then clone the HD to my server  and then later restore using network boot
[14:24] <ActionParsnip> rypervenche: when you use Ubuntu Classic, the unity shell doesn't run and Gnome panel runs instead. Both use Gnome 2.x
[14:24] <auronandace> hobbel: slow wifi? i use the same wifi, works fine for me
[14:24] <silverarrow> Dans326, like full backup?
[14:24] <pixel_shift> @dans326 I'm jumping in a little late here, but have you tried reinstalling grub to the MBR via a live CD? (I'm assuming its a dual boot sytem)

[14:25] <hobbel> and its annoying, so tried to evade it with windows drivers, but its completely gone now

[14:31] <pixel_shift> @hobbel Try this is terminal sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[14:31] <pixel_shift> But other than that... I have no idea
[14:32] <hobbel> Running /etc/init.d/networking restart is deprecated because it may not enable again some interfaces

[14:32] <hobbel> pixel_shift yes
[14:32] <pixel_shift> @hobbel Had no idea, but thanks for the info! lol
[14:33] <hobbel> its pretty dead right :P
[14:33] <pixel_shift> @hobbel Have you tried finding drivers for the chipset on the card and not the card itself?
[14:33] <hobbel> pixel_shift it has the right driver for the wifi chipset, and hardware has been found
[14:34] <Dans326> silverarrow:  I dont know about that but my wife cannot wear digital watches they never last more than a week or so even with coating the metal portions with nail polish
[14:34] <pixel_shift> @hobbel Some other drivers for other cards may work (Thats what I had to use ndiswrapper for in 8.04) if they have the same chipset as your card.
[14:34] <hobbel> pixel_shift might try that

[15:03] <Hemangpatel> and on 11.04 ?
[15:03] <tensorpudding> it will be gnome 3 underneath, but use the unity panel/launcher/dash
[15:04] <tensorpudding> on 11.04, unity on gnome 2 is default, with a fallback to gnome 2
[15:04] <tensorpudding> the fallback behaves like 10.10 and previous ubuntu versions

[15:59] <chewed-on> not sure what's  up with the one I installed to virtual box
[15:59] <iceroot_> chewed-on: vbox-nonfree? usb enabled? sounds like the general usb-vbox issue. please use #vbox
[15:59] <iceroot_> !ask | Aer
[15:59] <ubottu> Aer: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
[15:59] <chewed-on> virtual box is free isn't it ?
[15:59] <gdea73> well anyway, can anyone tell me why my computer talks to me? it's kind of creeping me out :P

[16:01] <silverarrow> <genii-around>, i see, thanks
[16:01] <cwood> chewed-on: What filesystem is the external drive?
[16:02] <chewed-on> ntfs
[16:02] <zykotick9> iceroot_, seems out of place for Oracle to do something right for a change ;)
[16:02] <iceroot_> silverarrow: i dont see an error
[16:02] <iceroot_> zykotick9: they destroy every free software... openoffice, vbox, java...
[16:02] <cwood> chewed-on: There's an "ntfs" kernel module. If you enable that with "modprobe ntfs" you might be able to mount that drive.
[16:02] <iceroot_> zykotick9: ksplice
[16:03] <zykotick9> iceroot_, oh, i hear ya!
[16:03] <chewed-on> cwood: kinda disappointing how fat 32 is windows and ntfs is also windows but can't be written to like how fat 32 can.
[16:03] <Aer> "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network. Others can access your computer using the address " means I cant access my computer remotely with remote desktop viewer away from home ?
[16:03] <cwood> chewed-on: or, "sudo modprobe ntfs".
[16:03] <gdea73> why is speech-dispatcher running when I open Sound Preferences?!
[16:03] <iceroot_> chewed-on: its not a ntfs issue
[16:03] <chewed-on> cwood: I'll get it a shot and see.
[16:03] <iceroot_> chewed-on: i already told you why you dont see the drive
[16:03] <chewed-on> I had to modprobe that kernel on gentoo linux too, I remember that
[16:04] <cwood> iceroot_: Aha, wasn't following along. Didn't think the drive was unavailable.
[16:04] <Aer> How can I make Remote Desktop Viewer in Ubuntu work over internet instead of just local home network ? I have forwrded the 5900 port on my router still no luck
[16:04] <chewed-on> modprobe command not found
[16:04] <silverarrow> iceroot, genii-around, gdea73, VLC is working !! ;- )

[16:04] <gdea73> silverarrow: great
[16:04] <iceroot_> chewed-on: you are using the "wrong" version of vbox which doesnt support usb
[16:05] <chewed-on> iceroot_: I did type sudo! I just pasted the error it returned
[16:05] <gdea73> but, @everyone: "Welcome to orca. Current desktop environment is classic gnome." it says this when I open sound preferences.
[16:05] <iceroot_> chewed-on: and you dont need to modprobe anything to write on ntfs

[16:06] <edbian> Aer: Have you ever used nmap?
[16:06] <Aer> ive never used nmap :s
[16:06] <sprung> www.nmap.org read
[16:06] <edbian> Aer: install it: sudo apt-get install nmap
[16:06] <Aer> ok
[16:06] <Aer> ok ill install now
[16:06] <Mkaysi_> Zenmap could be easier
[16:06] <edbian> Aer: then what we want to do is : nmap <public ip>   It's output is pretty clear I think.
[16:06] <chewed-on> iceroot_: fdisk -l would show the hard drive it vbox free version had support for it.
[16:06] <Mkaysi_> It's GUI for nmap.
[16:07] <Aer> ok
[16:07] <Aer> ill go do it now
[16:07] <sprung> Mkaysi_, wow, fail
[16:07] <chewed-on> I know how to mount the hard drive on linux with write permission
[16:07] <chewed-on> this channel is very laggy...
[16:07] <Aer> im assuming nmap on the computer i want to connect to right ? just making sure lol
[16:07] <iceroot_> chewed-on: if you dont see the drive with fdisk -l you cant mount the drive because its not there
[16:07] <edbian> Aer: nmap on the computer you're using to nmap
[16:07] <edbian> Aer: Umm, this isn't clear :P
[16:07] <sprung> nmap is a port scanner, Aer. it just helps find port connectivity problems.
[16:08] <edbian> Aer: no.  You want nmap on some other computer
[16:08] <Aer> ok
[16:08] <edbian> Aer: I suppose is really doesn't matter
[16:08] <Aer> ok
[16:08] <iceroot_> Aer: if you want to access your ubuntu over the internet you have to use port-forwarding in your router
[16:08] <sprung> i'm going to ask for help in #linux i'm not getting what i need here
[16:08] <edbian> iceroot_: he knows, we're checking using nmap
[16:08] <iceroot_> edbian: ah ok, because someone said use nmap on the local machine
[16:09] <Aer> yeah, i have forwarded the port 5900 but the remote desktop viewer still says its only connetable on the local network
[16:09] <edbian> iceroot_: I guess it doesn't matter right?  He wants to nmap the public IP
[16:09] <iceroot_> sprung: feel free to do so
[16:09] <edbian> Aer: The gui doesn't know what it's talking about
[16:09] <somethinginteres> why does GPGDir ask for the name of the recipient over and over again how do I use -r to tell it that each file goes to the one person?
[16:09] <Aer> lol
[16:09] <edbian> Aer: ignore that, have nmap yet?
[16:09] <iceroot_> edbian: no the router is seeing that the wan ip is maped to itself
[16:09] <Aer> yup just installed it
[16:09] <iceroot_> edbian: so its a lan request
[16:09] <sprung> iceroot_, thank you for your permission
[16:09] <iceroot_> edbian: let me correct, most routers act like that
[16:10] <iceroot_> edbian: so you have to use nmap outside from the lan

[16:21] <edbian> Aer: sure
[16:21] <Aer> so i gotta create rules for that port for every comp on my network lol
[16:21] <edbian> People are always so surprised when I'm right :(
[16:21] <fasta> sipior: just because you can only Google for information, does not mean that you should treat me like that.
[16:21] <Aer> lol i just thought it worked a litle differntly thats all :P
[16:21] <iceroot_> Aer: you can only forwarding a port ones
[16:21] <Aer> huh ?
[16:21] <iceroot_> Aer: you cant forward 5900 to 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.3
[16:21] <Aer> oh :s
[16:22] <edbian> Aer: well now that doesn't make sense.  Every request for remote desktop will be 'remote desktop to publicIP port 5900' how do you know which computer you'll get to?
[16:22] <iceroot_> Aer: you have to to something like 5900 on 192.168.0.2:5900 5901 on 192.168.0.3:5900 and so on
[16:22] <edbian> iceroot_: (ones = once)
[16:22] <iceroot_> edbian: :(
[16:22] <edbian> iceroot_: :P
[16:22] <sipior> fasta: why not? so you can cop a bigger attitude? please.
[16:22] <iceroot_> edbian: ( edbian = debian) :)
[16:22] <Aer> so I have one rule iceroot_ ? but i set it to more than one IP in one rule ?
[16:22] <edbian> hahaha
[16:23] <iceroot_> Aer: you have one rule for every port-forwarding
[16:23] <edbian> Aer: You have one rule for each computer
[16:23] <Aer> hmm ok
[16:23] <Aer> ill have to look into this then :) but i have atleast got the ball rolling and have an idea what to do now :) got one computer working online atleast :P
[16:23] <Aer> thanks a lot for your time guys :)
[16:23] <yuvateja> there is a need of any packages for java beens program
[16:23] <edbian> Aer: sure :)
[16:24] <iceroot_> Aer: and use a good password :)
[16:24] <Aer> yeah :P
[16:24] <Aer> I needed to get this working because im moving out tomorrow and got my parents on ubuntu lol, they are quite noobish xD im going to be needing remote control now and then to help them :P
[16:25] <edbian> Aer: teamviewer is also a good solution
[16:25] <Aer> yeah i tried that one :) it seems to be running in wine though ?
=== michael is now known as Guest6643
[16:25] <iceroot_> Aer: yes
[16:25] <Aer> that kinda put me off id prefer to be using something that runs native
[16:25] <Aer> incase of any bugs etc
[16:25] <edbian> Aer: I agree
[16:25] <Aer> im guessing im more likely to find a bug in remote control in wine than a native program
[16:26] <Aer> Team viewer is my main choice for a windows computer though it is a good program :)
[16:26] <iceroot_> Aer: and you dont have to "fight" with NAT
[16:26] <silverarrow> I cannot make minitube work, neither update to 1.1.5 from 1.1.3
[16:26] <Aer> lol yeah :P
[16:27] <iceroot_> silverarrow: whats the error when starting it?
[16:28] <Max00355> how can i go about making an IRC channel that is public and not only local?
[16:28] <iceroot_> silverarrow: ah i saw "minicom" never heard of minitube
[16:28] <Aer> anyway guys thanks for the help but i need to go now I have to finish preparing to move tomorrow :)
[16:28] <iceroot_> Max00355: /join #foobar
[16:28] <silverarrow> irceroot, cannot connect to source, or something like that, it finds videos, they get listed, but doesn't run
[16:28] <rypervenche> Aer: TeamViewer has prevented people from using it for more than 55 seconds now. :/
[16:29] <Aer> prevented them from using what ? :S
[16:29] <rypervenche> Aer: Their software. You have to buy the pro version to be able to use it for more than 55 seconds now. :(
[16:29] <Aer> really ? :s
[16:29] <Max00355> +
[16:29] <silverarrow> iceroot_, I tried adding a ppa too, but it didn't work
[16:30] <Aer> thats kinda...well not gonna swear but you know lol... i been using team viewer for ages when connecting to a windows comp
[16:30] <Aer> gonna need to find something new
[16:31] <rypervenche> Aer: Ditto :(
[16:31] <cwood> How often does upstart re-read /etc/init?
[16:32] <Aer> we can connect to windows "Remote Desktop client" using ubuntus Remote Desktop Viewer I guess, just need to find out how xD
[16:32] <Aer> but for me thats a task for another day too busy today lol
[16:33] <xeux> Aer - that's essentially a VNC client not an RDP client
[16:33] <Aer> ahh ok

[16:34] <Aer> ohh ok, cool
[16:35] <silverarrow> <scoundrel50a, have you tried reinstalling the packages from package manager?

[16:35] <Aer> but ill cya guys later thanks again :) but i have a lot of work to do before i move tomorrow

[16:37] <gr33n7007h> what runs on port 1001
[16:37] <benwork> I have ubuntu 11.04 installed, and it works fine in ubuntu classic mode. I have ATI with proprietary drivers installed with 2 monitors, both in single display mode. The issue is one display (the non-primary one) opens apps ala unity style with the title bar being part of the top bar, how can I styop this?
[16:37] <benwork> gr33n7007h, cat /etc/services |grep  1001
[16:37] <gr33n7007h> cheers
[16:37] <cwood> benwork: that's a superfluous use of cat (grep 1001 /etc/services)
[16:38] <scoundrel50a> I think it might be a  problem with the update though, they forgot to include Maverick in the updates to Chrome, how do I get over the install problem, that I added in my first post
[16:38] <benwork> I prefer the superfluous cat
[16:39] <xeux> benwork - sudo apt-get remove unity
[16:39] <rypervenche> scoundrel50a: Use chromium maybe?
[16:39] <scoundrel50a> same problem
[16:40] <scoundrel50a> its affected both

[16:45] <calwig> hi, I have a bit of an issue with the scrolling of the mousepad. Seemds like either code changed in xorg.conf or somewhere. What happens now is that I cannot scroll anywhere, and I used to be able to before (like 3 days ago) so where can I check this?

[17:01] <\n> Can anyone point me to an *open source* driver for Broadcomm wireless B43 card? I've been going absolutely bonkers trying to make buggy proprietary drivers work with ndiswrapper!
[17:02] <Jojo__> hi, i recenly updated my 10.10 version to 11.04 through the update manager and now its takes about 20 second for the desktop to show up after loggong in. Any solutions ?
[17:02] <nicofs> flametai1, the ffmpeg version provided by ubuntu might be out of date... it *might* help to compile ffmpeg yourself...
[17:02] <zykotick9> !broadcom | \n does this help?

[17:03] <\n> Let me check - this is such a relief finding folks looking to help!
[17:03] <nicofs> flametai1, otherwise try #fmpeg
[17:03] <nicofs> flametai1, sorry, #ffmpeg
[17:03] <calwig> can anyone give me tips on the Mousepad?
[17:03] <Jojo__> arrrm, hi, i recenly updated my 10.10 version to 11.04 through the update manager and now its takes about 20 second for the desktop to show up after loggong in. Any solutions ? Anyone?
[17:03] <zykotick9> calwig, mousepad or touchpad?
[17:04] <tystr> I'm running ubuntu server 10.04....I just did a apt-get dist-upgrade....now, I've got broken php packages :(
[17:04] <ActionParsnip> Jojo__: what video chip do you use?
[17:04] <zykotick9> calwig, 8.04 isn't supported any longer
[17:04] <\n> But won't I have to cut out of the windows driver? I think this is what's been causing my problem. You mean nobody's written an open source Ubuntu compatible driver? I think every Acer out there uses Broadcom...
[17:05] <\l> tystr: Next time, use aptitude for a full upgrade like that.
[17:05] <doriad> everything that uses opengl seems to be horribly slow on my new 11.04 install. I'm using the nvidia driver that ubuntu recommend I install
[17:05] <\l> tystr: Try opening aptitude, and see if it can resolve your dependency problems.
[17:05] <tystr> \l: what do you mean? I used apt-get
[17:05] <\l> tystr: run "sudo aptitude -u"
[17:05] <zykotick9> \l, aptitude isn't included in ubuntu by default!
[17:05] <\l> tystr: It has a text user interface.
[17:05] <Slart> doriad: it might be using the nouveaeu driver instead of the nvidia binary driver
[17:06] <\l> zykotick9: I assume he uses ubuntu-server, since he's talking about PHP.
[17:06] <ActionParsnip> doriad: can you pastebin the output of:  sudo lshw -C display; lsb_release -a; dpkg -l | grep nvidia
[17:06] <Jojo__> ActionParsnip: i have an hd5770
[17:06] <doriad> Slart, how would I check?
[17:06] <glebihan> flametai1, installing libavcodec-extra-52 might help
