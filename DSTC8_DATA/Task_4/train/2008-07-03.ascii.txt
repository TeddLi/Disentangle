[21:55] <ubottu> _2, please see my private message
[21:55] <distatica> ie. right now I have 3 col, 2 row layout for virtual workspaces, and the bottom 3 are two terminals each aligned to split the screen vertically, I don't want to set that up manually every time.
[21:55] <X3> Im gonna try it one last time then Ill just go back to having crap windows
[21:55] <Fryguy--> derekS: i'd probably recommend just installing smplayer though, it's going to work out a lot better for you
[21:55] <joaopinto> voyagi, http://blog.gauner.org/2008/06/26/firefox-3-keeps-switching-to-offline-mode/
[21:55] <Fryguy--> distatica: devilspie + sessions might be able to do what you want.  Or you can explore other window managers that are available

[21:55] <X3> moutpoint is / yes?
[21:55] <Fryguy--> X3: yes
[21:55] <deserteagle> unop: it says to insert "gtk-can-change-accels = 1" in the .gtkrc-2.0 file and run gnome-settings-daemon
[21:56] <deserteagle> unop: which i did before and it worked, now it doesn't
[21:56] <derekS> Fryguy--: i am trying to keep this as vanilla as possible :) i have gstreamer good, bad, base, and ugly installed, what else do i need?
[21:56] <Fryguy--> derekS: no idea
[21:56] <X3> should I check format box (so far I havent checked that)
[21:56] <Fryguy--> derekS: like I said, i'd recommend using smplayer
[21:56] <Fryguy--> X3: no idea
[21:56] <voyagi> joaopinto: I can't finde toolkit.networkmanager
[21:56] <derekS> lol
[21:57] <X3> argh lol
[21:57] <soundray> derekS: if you load the divx file into totem, it'll offer to download the codec package it needs
[21:57] <unop> deserteagle, maybe gtk-can-change-accels is no longer recongnised as a valid option by gtk ?  does gnome-settings-daemon have anything to say when you launch it from the command line?
[21:57] <joaopinto> voyagi, forget it, at the ends he states that the only fix is to remove the network manager
[21:57] <karname> please help me : please help me , i clicked on upper panel in ubuntu and delete that , and add that again but the my item in panel loss , how i can resetore default of it ?
[21:57] <derekS> soundray: hmm, it isn't its giving me an error which i figured was due to bad codecs: Failed to connect stream: Invalid argument
[21:57] <Dark_Fire> hey
[21:57] <voyagi> joaopinto: Can't I just config my 3G-broadband with the networkmanager?
[21:58] <Dark_Fire> Whats the name of the VNC client used in Ubuntu HH?
[21:58] <X3> ok Fryguy Im fried
[21:58] <amenado> vncviewer
[21:58] <Fryguy--> karname: easiest way is to remove all gnome panel settings from your home directory.  better solution is to just put it back the way you want it.  the panels are meant to be customizable anyway
[21:58] <X3> totally and utterly brain fracked
[21:58] <joaopinto> voyagi, no idea :\
[21:59] <_2> karname wipe out the local config    but i'm not sure where it is.   in ~/.gnome*  or ~/.nautilus*   idk
[21:59] <soundray> derekS: in that case, I suggest you try the w32codecs package from medibuntu

[22:00] <karname> Fryguy-- : how i do it ?
[22:00] <derekS> soundray: thanks!
[22:00] <Kitu> how can restore my system ?
[22:00] <Fryguy--> karname: instructions were just posted
[22:00] <unop> deserteagle, might be that your dbus daemon isn't running.  try launching it this way.   dbus-launch $(which gnome-settings-daemon)
[22:01] <_2> ouch !!!   *** glibc detected *** corrupted double-linked list: 0xb7c78358 ***
[22:01] <Kitu> or i can tell my problem in details ?

[22:02] <SeveredCross> Oh hell, there's an update to openarena-data.
[22:02] <Kromel> Kitu, what error messages are you getting when you try to start Apache2?
[22:02] <_2> SeveredCross that's not even on the box i am trying to configure.   that box should be stable
[22:02] <SeveredCross> Kitu: You've already got a daemon listening onn port 80.
[22:02] <BRIGHTshadow525> I just put in a USB stick for the first time on this OS..... Where do I go to browse it?
[22:02]  * X3 feels sorry for Fryguy

[22:03] <unop> Kitu, i asked _how_ -- how are you launching it?
[22:03] <Fryguy--> karname: a copy/paste command was already posted to the channel, just use that
[22:03] <SeveredCross> Kitu: Try using netsat to find out.
[22:03] <deamonmind> Hey everyone, i wanted to know is that, i hav vista and ubuntu installed on my sata drive, i want to remove vista and replace it with xp, if i do that, i have to make ubuntu's new installation?
[22:03] <soundray> BRIGHTshadow525: see if 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' shows any errors logged in connection with the plugin event
[22:03] <SeveredCross> The correct command would probably be sudo netstat --listening --numeric-ports.
[22:03] <Kitu> unop, i rebooted ubuntu
[22:03] <Kitu> and no apache2 launch

[22:03] <Fryguy--> deamonmind: after you do that, grub will break, and you'll have to boot from the livecd to repair it.  Plenty of documentation for completing this process available on google
[22:03] <_2> deamonmind no.  but you will have to refresh grub
[22:03] <unop> Kitu, try this.   sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

[22:20] <ubottu> andy_: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[22:20] <Fryguy--> !firewall | andy_

[22:21] <unop> Kitu, does this return anything?  sudo fuser -v -n tcp 80
[22:21] <SliMM> yes
[22:21] <_2> hmmm
[22:21] <SliMM> just that and nothing more
[22:21] <shadowimmage> Khisanth: it does do the paste thing, but I'm used to it scrolling in firefox. It does on my other computer, but for some reason not on this one (they're both ThinkPads)
[22:21] <SliMM> Fryguy--: no prompt for a username
[22:21] <Fryguy--> SliMM: what kind of machine are you connecting to
[22:21] <soundray> _2: have you had a thorough look at your dmesg output?
=== andy_ is now known as xtknight
[22:21] <Kitu> unop, nothing
[22:21] <SliMM> Fryguy--: what do you mean by that?
[22:21] <joaopinto> Kitar88, have you changed your apache conf somehow ?
[22:21] <andy__> wow how the hell do you know all that stuff
[22:21] <andy__> dam u guys are good
[22:21] <joaopinto> ops, i meant Kitu
[22:21] <Fryguy--> SliMM: are you sshing to another ubuntu machine or ?
[22:22] <rogue_trader> where can I get an overview of the most important terminal commands?
[22:22] <SliMM> Fryguy--: it's my old computer running ubuntu server in my wlan
[22:22] <joaopinto> !commands | rogue_trader
[22:22] <ubottu> rogue_trader: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
[22:22] <soundray> _2: if you see any seemingly relevant messages, it's worth websearching for them
[22:22] <Kitu> joaopinto, it is possible ...
[22:22] <rogue_trader> thanks
[22:22] <Kitu> but i have re installed
[22:22] <pulse00> soundray, in the Screen Resolution i only have one monitor displayed
[22:22] <joaopinto> Kitar88, reinstalling does not reset your configuration
[22:22] <_2> soundray "dmesg | grep -i acpi | pastebin"   http://ubuntu.pastebin.us/?show=d33d58cd5
[22:22] <Fryguy--> SliMM: does the verbosity provided by -vvv do anything meaningful
[22:22] <unop> Kitu, did you purge and install again or just reinstalled?
[22:22] <joaopinto> Kitar88, sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2
[22:22] <Kitu> joaopinto, i have delete apache compltly and reinstall
[22:23] <Kitu> unicum, yes
[22:23] <joaopinto> Kitar88, have you used the purge option ?
[22:23] <SliMM> Fryguy--: triple v?
[22:23] <Kitu> unop, yes
[22:23] <unop> Kitu, yes to what tho?
[22:23] <Fryguy--> SliMM: yes
[22:23] <Kitu> i'm going to retry
[22:23] <shadowimmage> rogue_trader>http://www.ss64.com/bash/
[22:23] <joaopinto> erm, I meant Kitu
[22:23] <soundray> _2: and if you're ready for an adventure, decompile your DSDT with iasl and fix the bugs
[22:23] <Fryguy--> brb going to switch to laptop and listen to some music in my living room
[22:23] <joaopinto> Kitu, you must use the --purge option on the remove command
[22:23] <SliMM> Fryguy--: user@host or just host?
[22:23] <Kitu> i use synaptic ..
[22:23] <Fryguy--> SliMM: just host
[22:23] <Kitu> and "complete delete"
[22:23] <soundray> pulse00: have you got two monitors connected right now?
[22:24] <joaopinto> Kitu, from the terminal: sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2
[22:24] <unop> Kitu, might i suggest this.   sudo sh -c " aptitude purge apache2 && aptitude install apache2 "
[22:24] <Kitu> yes
[22:24] <SliMM> Fryguy--: nothing meaningful to me
[22:24] <Kitu> huhu :)
[22:24] <Fryguy--> SliMM: pastebin it anyways?
[22:24] <joaopinto> or unop's suggestion
[22:24] <pulse00> soundray, yes
[22:24] <_2> soundray that's the thing.   dmesg output sujest that acpi support whould "just work"  but sensors-detect can't find anything   and the gui powermanager can't start.    "advneture" ?   i don't C  err C++ either
[22:24] <pulse00> soundray, the second monitor simply clones the first one atm
[22:24] <Kitu> what's the difference in apt-get and aptitude ?
[22:24] <Kitu> into*
[22:25] <soundray> pulse00: that's great though, no?
[22:25] <meme03847> hey guys, anyone know if theres a good way to search a network for ssh servers running?
[22:25] <joaopinto> Kitu, they are just difference interfaces for package management, follow unop's suggestion
[22:25] <kitche> Kitu: nothing really anymore just one is like synaptic but for terminal pretty much
[22:25] <Fryguy--> meme03847: nmap port 22
[22:25] <SliMM> Fryguy--: just to extra debug messages: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/24807/ (debug2, none debug3)
[22:25] <meme03847> Fryguy--, really?
[22:25] <Kitu> ok in french i would better understand
[22:25] <Kitu> :)
[22:25] <unop> Kitu, this might be better.  sudo sh -c " aptitude purge $( dpkg -l | grep -i apache | cut -d " " -f 3 ) && aptitude install apache2 "
[22:26] <Kitu> huhu
[22:26] <Fryguy--> meme03847: yes
[22:26] <SliMM> Fryguy--: just two extra* lol
[22:26] <soundray> _2: lm-sensors and acpi have little to do with each other. Do you get any output from acpi -V ?
[22:26] <meme03847> Fryguy--, wow, thanks!
[22:26] <quinto> ?
[22:26] <rogue_trader> does anyone know when intrepid ibex RC will be available for the general curious public?
[22:26] <_2> soundray just the copyright notice
[22:26] <shadowimmage> is there a certain chat for ubuntu+wine issues?
[22:27] <soundray> rogue_trader: October
[22:27] <soundray> rogue_trader: oh, you said rc -- probably late September
[22:27] <Kitu> unop, aptitude in parano mmode :p
[22:27] <_2> soundray   http://ubuntu.pastebin.us/?show=d2a56b7e6
[22:27] <Fryguy--> rogue_trader: probably something late august or september
[22:27] <Fryguy--> ah, nice now i'm on my laptop, lounging on couch and listening to some music
[22:27] <Fryguy--> on my nice soundsystem :)
[22:28] <djh82uk> hiya, im having a problem with nvidia and my display, monitor switches off on bootup now, can anyone help?
[22:28] <Kitu> but i write that unop thanks

[22:28] <Kitu> in french
[22:28] <soundray> _2: if it was my laptop, I'd recompile the DSDT and see how it goes
[22:28] <Kitu> in english i don't know
[22:28] <rogue_trader> i am tempted to try a rolling distro like arch just to always get the latest stuff. besides having a fun but tough time setting up everything, why should I stay with ubuntu?
[22:29] <unop> Kitu, paranoid :)
[22:29] <rogue_trader> are there stability advantages of "frozen" versions of packages?
[22:29] <Fryguy--> rogue_trader: most other distros you use are going to be harder to configure and not as well documented
[22:29] <chrisccoulson> <unconvertable> djh82uk - what happens if you boot without 'quiet' and 'splash'
[22:29] <_2> soundray only reason i don't is   umm "you're speeking geek as far as i can tell"
[22:29] <SliMM> Fryguy--: how can I delete everything stored on my computer regarding a certain ssh connection?

[22:31] <Fryguy--> djh82uk: ask a question, don't ask to ask

[22:33] <Eric7> dont think so
[22:33] <Fryguy--> Eric7: install that

[22:33] <Kitu> yes unop
[22:33] <unop> Kitu, strange

[22:34] <soundray> matthew__: rightclick - Add to Panel - Drawer
[22:34] <Fryguy--> Eric7: any reason why you aren't using swfdec from repositories?
[22:34] <_2> soundray k.   search for that string hit twice and both are showing     sys/drivers/acpi/blacklist.c   as the main event
[22:34] <SliMM> Fryguy--: any idea regarding a subversion daemon?

[22:35] <Kitu> unop, in first commands when apache2 installed it, the installation had delete some packages ... and 5 or 6 same the result now with your command for the losts ...
[22:35] <soundray> matthew__: or just drag a folder to the panel
[22:35] <simulous> or just drag it @ matthew
[22:35] <matthew__> thanks guys
[22:35] <SliMM> Fryguy--: firstly, what do I need to install for a svn server?
[22:35] <lorenzo_> unop, sorry still not mounting
[22:35] <simulous> it sayting my password is to short.
[22:35] <Fryguy--> SliMM: nothing
[22:35] <Fryguy--> SliMM: just install the svn package
[22:35] <unop> Kitu, put to the pastebin whatever you see there
[22:35] <SliMM> Fryguy--: subversion?
[22:35] <unop> lorenzo_, ok, how do you know it isn't mounting? any errors?

[22:36] <Kitu> ok
[22:36] <Ayabara> what's the default font in Ubuntu? I installed a theme that suggested a font, but I don't like it and want to go back

[22:36] <simulous> wooow and i thought our helpdesk was busy! :P
[22:36] <Fryguy--> SliMM: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Subversion
[22:36] <SliMM> I'll read the svn book then and hope for the best
[22:36] <soundray> simulous: it's fairly quiet atm
[22:36] <lorenzo_> no, just nothing happens in the terminal, i only get a > and if i try to access the partition, i get the same error
[22:36] <_2> simulous then make it longer

[22:37] <SliMM> Fryguy--: ah, thanks, I like quick introductions better
[22:37] <unop> lorenzo_, that means the command you typed in was incomplete -- make sure you have the right command

[22:45] <djh82uk> does not give me any options to adjust gfx settings
[22:45] <Fryguy--> djh82uk: don't use framebuffer, that's almost certainly the wrong choice
[22:45] <PeterFA> I use the package configuer and it fails, producing a useless config.
[22:45] <djh82uk> I also tried it without
[22:45] <telexicon> I'm getting an error with this interfaces file on one machine but an almost identical config (different only with the ip addresses) works fine on another box, The error I get is: /etc/network/interfaces:27: duplicate option ifup: couldn't read interfaces file "/etc/network/interfaces" http://paste.ubuntu.com/24816/
[22:45] <Kitu> it's damage that ubuntu have not restore system
[22:45] <owner> ok i found the nonfree flash one..  just search forjava nonfree now?
[22:46] <Kitu> by default
[22:46] <purplestar> how can I copy my home madde DVD to HDD?
[22:46] <telexicon> owner, sun-java6-jre
[22:46] <kkathman> Anyone use banshee for their music player?  I'm tryping to get it to import the music titles from a network drive and it doesnt seem to work :(
[22:46] <owner> ok thank
[22:46] <telexicon> owner, sun-java6-plugin for the browser plugin
[22:46] <purplestar> how can I copy my home madde DVD to HDD as an AVI or MPEG?
[22:46] <lorenzo_> unop, it says if i have window i can use the safely remove hardware option; or else i can force mount. but I cant really safely remove hardware, i'm talking about partitions on the HD itself. Is using force a risk?
[22:46] <owner> do i need both or the one  for the browser only
[22:46] <Fryguy--> telexicon: does the file have the same permissions on both machines?
[22:47] <telexicon> owner, install sun-java6-plugin and it will take care of the rest
[22:47] <unop> lorenzo_, do you have an error message there?
[22:47] <Eric7> meh gotta restart brb
[22:47] <lorenzo_> unop, yeah, where do i paste it=
[22:47] <Fryguy--> PeterFA: make changes to xorg.conf manually, usually faster
[22:47] <telexicon> Fryguy--, is root:root 644 on both
[22:47] <karname> what best of sound editor and studio manager in linux?
[22:47] <Kitu> unop, apache work thank :)
[22:47] <joaopinto> !best | karname
[22:47] <ubottu> karname: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[22:47] <owner> great.. thanks for helping out a nobody
[22:47] <Fryguy--> karname: audacity is pretty good as a sound editor
[22:47] <PeterFA> Fryguy--: thanks, but there are awefully lot of settings and stuff I just don't know.
[22:47] <Kitu> unop, but my script ... lol
[22:48] <joaopinto> owner, we are all someone :)
[22:48] <Kitu> i don't my public_html
[22:48] <unop> lorenzo_, ohh i see -- this is a windows ntfs partition that has not been properly dismounted -- you should be able to force mount it this way.  sudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o force /dev/sda6 /media/sda6
[22:48] <PeterFA> Fryguy--: there is a script called xorgconfig that never failed me.
[22:48] <Fryguy--> PeterFA: the config is only a few dozen lines long, it's pretty straightforward and human readable
[22:48] <Kitu> unop,  but it's good for this night, i'm going to sleep
[22:48] <unop> Kitu, well, atleast you have solved on problem -- take this step by step, you will get there soon :)
[22:48] <unop> Kitu, bon soir
[22:48] <SliMM> Fryguy--: how can I make svnserve start at the same time with the computer, just like all other daemons?
[22:48] <Kitu> bonne nuit et doux reves :)
[22:48] <lorenzo_> unop, thanks
[22:48] <Boopop> Hi all, I'm installing linux on a computer with only a wireless connection to the net. How can I get WICD from their repository, then put it on a flash drive from my Linux laptop to the new linux box?
[22:48] <PeterFA> Fryguy--: any auto configuer?
[22:49] <Boopop> Ubuntu*
[22:49] <Fryguy--> SliMM: make an init script, place it in /etc/init.d and use rc-update
[22:49] <meme03847> is there a windows equivalent to the linux "find" command?
[22:49] <PeterFA> Fryguy--: it has more to do with modlines and driver names.
[22:49] <Fryguy--> PeterFA: dunno
[22:49] <PeterFA> meme03847: grep.
[22:49] <joaopinto> SliMM, better edit /etc/rc.local
[22:49] <distatica> Is there a way to launch a program from the command line, and have it go to a specific workspace under gnome?
[22:49] <Fryguy--> PeterFA: modelines are not needed anymore, you can just delete them
[22:49] <lorenzo_> unop, yeah it worked! thanks
[22:49] <Fryguy--> distatica: check out devilspie
[22:49] <kitche> Fryguy--: actually they are still needed unless you use kde or gnome really
[22:49] <Fryguy--> kitche: not in my experience
[22:50] <unop> lorenzo_, when you have time - unmount the volume and run this command.  sudo aptitude install ntfs-tools; sudo ntfsfix /dev/sda6 # use with caution
[22:50] <unop> lorenzo_, nice
[22:50] <SliMM> oh, here's another question regarding ssh, how can I run programs on my computer using input from ssh?
[22:50] <karname> Fryguy-- : is there another program ?
[22:50] <unop> lorenzo_, sorry that was ntfsprogs not ntfs-tools
[22:50] <lorenzo_> unop, can i do that for the other partition on which xp is installed, as well? or do i risk any data loss?
[22:50] <European-African> hey, can you install ubuntu completely in LVM, including swap? Also it is better to leave some important partitions out like boot/swap?
[22:50] <neels> karname,  http://ardour.org/
[22:50] <Fryguy--> karname: i'm sure there is, i'm not an encyclopedia of available linux packages, search apt or google
[22:50] <telexicon> meme03847, the little search dog
[22:50] <meme03847> PeterFA, no, the other way, i mean the linux find command, not the windows find command
[22:50] <Fryguy--> SliMM: elaborate?
[22:51] <SliMM> for example, how can I use... gparted to manage partitions on another computer
[22:51] <hiptobecubic> After you start a webcam, it takes a minute to autobalance the brightness and color and all. is that done via the drivers or via the v4l software?
[22:51] <unop> lorenzo_, well, unless that partition has the same problem requiring you to force mount -- don't do it, ntfsfix is to be used sparingly
[22:51] <PeterFA> meme03847: no, there's no equivelent.
[22:51] <lorenzo_> unop, what is ntfs tools for?
[22:51] <tomd123> European-African: you can install ubuntu with lvm
[22:51] <telexicon> European-African, the only one you have to leave out is /boot .. everything else can be in lvm
[22:51] <joaopinto> European-African, if you are going to use LVM all partitions should go into a VG
[22:51] <Fryguy--> SliMM: X11 forwarding
[22:51] <unop> lorenzo_, for the ntfsfix command
[22:51] <meme03847> PeterFA, sweet
[22:51] <karname> Fryguy-- : tanks
[22:51] <Fryguy--> SliMM: assuming xauth is set up (it probably is).  ssh -X 192.x.x.x.  and then if you run a gui application, it should pop on the machine you are connecting from automatically
[22:52] <SliMM> Fryguy--: well, X11 forwarding works the other way round
[22:52] <lorenzo_> unop, well that partition is not mounting either. for now i dont need to access it, but i may in the future? should i wait? any possibility of the problem fixing itself when I use XP again?
[22:52] <Fryguy--> SliMM: you might need to play around with exporting DISPLAY to :1 or something, google for X11 forwarding and you'll get some more info if you need it
[22:52] <AMLNXUSR> Can someone please help me out..?I cant get my sound card to work. I have a soundblasters audigy 2.. ive tried configureing the mixer and have turn all availalbe options on and off it doesn't seem to work ... IF anyone can give me some tips on how to get it workin i would really appreciat it...
[22:52] <SliMM> Fryguy--: I mean, I use programs on the server to play with local stuff
[22:52] <distatica> Fryguy--, I was hoping for something that didn't run in the background, but I think I will try this anyways, since it looks useful for a bunch of things. thanks :)
[22:52] <European-African> thanks, it is anything better as a primary partition as appose to in a LV, swap for instance?
[22:52] <LinuxID10T> is any one here
[22:52] <Fryguy--> oh, no you can't do that
[22:52] <Fryguy--> SliMM:
[22:52] <SliMM> I want to use programs on my local computer to play with remote stuff
[22:52] <unop> lorenzo_, ideally, you should fix this in windows -- boot up into windows and use the chkdsk commands on the volumes i.e. chkdsk /f /v d:
[22:53] <SliMM> Fryguy--: ok, thanks
[22:53] <lorenzo_> unop, ok
[22:53] <unop> lorenzo_, i assumed you didn't have windows - which was why i suggested ntfsfix
[22:53] <lorenzo_> thanks
[22:53] <SliMM> Fryguy--: i'll stick to cli programs
[22:53] <SliMM> Fryguy--: or use sftp :-?
[22:53] <lorenzo_> unop, no i do have xp installed. thanks a lot, you have been very helpful
[22:54] <lorenzo_> unop, all the best, take care
[22:54] <unop> thanks, you too
[22:54] <Ballena> How do I get the current timestamp? I want to use it in a bash script.
[22:54] <Fryguy--> Ballena: `date`
[22:54] <danza> Ballena, 'date'
[22:54] <unop> Ballena, timestamp as in seconds since the epoch?
[22:54] <SliMM> what does this mean:  This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
[22:54] <SliMM> ?
[22:54] <Fryguy--> Ballena: use my quotes, not danzas
[22:55] <Fryguy--> SliMM: it means it runs when you turn into multiuser level
[22:55] <Ballena> dandel: OK. How do I make the results of 'date' a variable?
[22:55] <Fryguy--> (which happens after the network comes up on ubuntu systems
[22:55] <Fryguy--> Ballena: use my quotes, not danzas
[22:55] <unop> Ballena, var=$(date)
[22:55] <danza> Ballena, it's right how Fryguy-- says, or you can use $(date) if you don't have an american keyboard
[22:55] <EvilMech> join #hqa.nl m3kk3r
[22:56] <unop> Ballena, use $() rather than `` actually :)
[22:56] <SliMM> Fryguy--: it seems that operating systems are quite complex :-P
[22:56] <Fryguy--> SliMM: eh, not really
[22:56] <Ballena> unop: ok
[22:56] <Ballena> thanks
[22:56] <European-African> <unconvertable> telexicon or <unconvertable> joaopinto, is swap better in a primary partition as appose to being in a LV? or does it not make a difference?
[22:56] <Fryguy--> European-African: no difference
[22:56] <SliMM> Fryguy--: well, I hope I'll have time to study this in detail
[22:56] <European-African> <unconvertable> Fryguy--, thans
[22:57] <telexicon> European-African, no difference
[22:57] <j_d_eisenberg> The $( ) notation is preferred in modern bash scripts.

[23:05] <Xoferif> Hello, I've followed the following steps to share my internet connection: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/sharing-internet-connection-in-ubuntu.html and it worked fine, but after I've restarted the internet sharing is gone, I wonder how I make it share the internet on startup? also what of those do I have to repeat now to share my internet? thanks
[23:05] <Fryguy--> hlfshell: install openssh-server
[23:05] <joaopinto> amortvigil, eventually because it's a low interest channel :) ?

[23:05] <amortvigil> joaopinto, thats why i ask it here :P
[23:05] <jyoseph> I got it working
[23:06] <Fryguy--> jyoseph: what'd you end up doing
[23:06] <jyoseph> Trip to Best Buy and a new video card did the trick

[23:06] <jyoseph> I feel so horrible, sorry dude
[23:06] <jyoseph> no config needed

[23:07]  * DIL you gotta believe that there are some snart people in here jy
[23:07] <SliMM> no one knows the answer? :(
[23:07] <amortvigil> joaopinto, i can always try :)
[23:07] <Fryguy--> oldjohn: yes
[23:07] <SliMM> at least, how can I restart the pulse audio server?
[23:07] <jyoseph> Fryguy-- but on another note, Ubuntu has never looked so juicy
[23:07] <kapin768> connecting via samba ssh or sftp?
[23:07] <SliMM> or asla or whatever I am using
[23:07] <jyoseph> wow
[23:08] <|thunder> SliMM; sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart                             i think
[23:08] <Fryguy--> SliMM: /etc/init.d/(somethingthatlookslikealsaorpulseaudio) restart
[23:08] <Fryguy--> SliMM: ls is your friend
[23:08] <jyoseph> Fryguy-- I owe you huge tho... thanks
[23:09] <sjdurfey> Fryguy--: is the /var/log/Xorg.log file created after a login attempt?
[23:09] <Fryguy--> sjdurfey: yep, it might be called something else, just take a look in /var/log, the file that you need should be obvious based on the hint
[23:10] <hse-hoens> is there a way to determine where ubuntu is hanging during the loading process?
[23:10] <sjdurfey> Fryguy--: the problem i am having is that after i login and Xserver restarts, i hit ctl+alt+f1 and that causes my system to freeze
[23:10] <hse-hoens> my computer got kinda borked, and i'm curious to see what happend
[23:10] <Fryguy--> sjdurfey: no idea then
[23:10] <kapin768> so don't press ctrl alt f1
[23:10] <kitche> hse-hoens: yes remove splash from menu.lst
[23:11] <powertool08> I'm trying to get ssh up and with the wrong combination I'm added to the denied hosts, how can I make it stop adding my remote computer to this list? Or at least change the number of failures before it adds the remote host to the list?
[23:11] <sjdurfey> could there be a problem with /etc/X11/xorg.conf file?
[23:11] <hse-hoens> so i have to login with a live cd, and then edit that file?
[23:12] <Fryguy--> powertool08: authorized and denied hosts are stored in ~/.ssh/ just edit/clear that directory
[23:12] <Fryguy--> sjdurfey: sure
[23:12] <powertool08> Fryguy--: thanks
[23:12] <Fryguy--> sjdurfey: there could also be a problem with the driver that you are using for graphics

[23:13] <oldjohn> I can access my Mac from Ubuntu PC on my LAN using a web browser.  After installing some package (didn't write it down and can't identify it now), I am able to access the Ubuntu PC with a web browser on my Mac.  But I only get the page that says, "It works!"  But I can't seem to get any further than that.  How can I see the file structure of the Ubuntu PC?
[23:13] <Fryguy--> SliMM: i don't use pulseaudio, and I don't put my *nix machine into suspend so I can't help you
[23:13] <jyoseph> When I want to use the file browser and open a file, before I do I type "gksudo nautilus" in terminal.... is that okay?
[23:14] <danza> hse-hoens, no, simply type 'e' or something similar on grub boot menu, remove 'splash' and then type 'b' for boot; sorry letters coult be different ... check tips in the menu

[23:14] <SliMM> Fryguy--: perhaps I should stick to asla for now
[23:14] <Fryguy--> oldjohn: using a web browser to browse computer contents isn't the right way to be doing that.  You want to set up an NFS share.  Google "ubuntu nfs" for how to do it, and to access it, use directory utility in mac (assuming you are on leopard)
[23:14] <powertool08> Fryguy--: I only see authorized_keys, id_rsa, id_rsa.pub, and known_hosts, but in /var/log/denyhosts it lists my remote pc several times (these are just messages right? so deleting them won't help)
[23:14] <grobda24> oldjohn ... have you tried something like file:/// in the browser ?
[23:14] <Fryguy--> powertool08: why is it getting denied

[23:15] <kitche> s3a: try swfdec-plugin
[23:15] <grobda24> jyoseph ... it is of you want to run a nautilus window as root to do a specific thing and then close it.

[23:16] <Fryguy--> s3a: adobe flash works fine in 64-bit.  As for a free solution, you can try gnash, but it doesn't work very well

[23:20] <Xoferif> do we have 1337 users in the channel or is this a joke
[23:20] <Fryguy--> Al-G77: your onboard card doesn't do 5.1?  pretty much every onboard soundcard made in the past 10 years or so does 5.1
[23:20] <Xoferif> aye 1338 now
[23:20] <Fryguy--> powertool08: check /var/log/messages
[23:20] <TheMinister> im trying to use an alt disc to install, but it just tries a normal install, or at least one that looks like it- what is going on? i thought it was supposed to be text based?
[23:20] <Fryguy--> rand0m: 3.5"
[23:20] <Al-G77> nope lol it's a dell optiplex 745 so not great sound support
[23:20] <Fryguy--> rand0m: if it's a desktop, if it's a laptop it'll be 2.5
[23:20] <JoshuaP0x> hello
[23:20] <Fryguy--> rand0m: 5.25 is used for cdroms and stuff
[23:20] <kitche> TheMinister: not really it uses the debian installer instead of the gui
[23:20] <JoshuaP0x> i'm trying to get visual effects working but i get a "Desktop effects can not be enabled"
[23:21] <powertool08> Fryguy--: nothing :/
[23:21] <JoshuaP0x> anyone run into this before?
[23:21] <vlt> up_the_irons: Works in Konqueror here, for example.
[23:21] <Fryguy--> Al-G77: so go grab an old cheap sblive or something
[23:21] <Fryguy--> powertool08: look around the other log files
[23:21] <Decepticon> how do i tell ncurses to make lines instead of dashes
[23:21] <TheMinister> so its going? even though it is taking forever?
[23:21] <Al-G77> it's a mini case so would need to be a half height pcie card
[23:21] <Fryguy--> JoshuaP0x: are you running 3d accelerated drivers?
[23:21] <michaelb> Xoferif:  hahah, ubuntu isn't very 1337, though that is amusing
[23:21] <JoshuaP0x> dont know
[23:21] <up_the_irons> vlt: do you mind pasting the relevant lines of your xorg.conf?  i can't see to get it working on my X300
[23:21] <JoshuaP0x> dont think so
[23:21] <Al-G77> don't really know which ones would work with ubuntu
[23:21] <Fryguy--> JoshuaP0x: well you need 3d acceleration to use compiz
[23:22] <DigitalNinja> Does anyone know where I can get a bunch of used ThinkPad Laptops? I want to setup a mobile Ubuntu computer lab.
[23:22] <JoshuaP0x> how do i use that?
[23:22] <kitche> DigitalNinja: from a computer show most likely
[23:22] <tomd123> DigitalNinja: ebay
[23:22] <Fryguy--> JoshuaP0x: how do you use what
[23:22] <JoshuaP0x> Checking for Xgl: not present.
[23:22] <JoshuaP0x> Found laptop using ati driver.
[23:22] <DigitalNinja> kitche: Don't have those in Anchorage Alaska.
[23:22] <vlt> up_the_irons: I think it's rather a Konqueror feature than something X related ...
[23:23] <rand0m> Fryguy--: awesome, thanks again.  please tell me you get paid for this
[23:23] <Fryguy--> rand0m: no
[23:23] <up_the_irons> vlt: oh ok
[23:23] <DigitalNinja> tomd123: I could look on ebay.
[23:23] <Eric7> i found i need "In this case, you will need to install the glibc-devel, python-gobject-devel, and libglib2-devel packages. Please note that since you are using 64-bit, that these package names may vary a bit on your system."
[23:23] <Eric7> how can i get them?
[23:23] <up_the_irons> vlt: the one i'm talking about is X11 related.  for example: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=313085
[23:23] <Fryguy--> Eric7: apt-get install <name of package>
[23:23] <DigitalNinja> Does anyone know of an online store that would have used ThinkPad laptops?
[23:23] <Eric7> dont work
[23:23] <Eric7> says not found
[23:24] <Fryguy--> Eric7: then you need "vary the package names a bit on your system"
[23:24] <Eric7> eric@Chad:~$ sudo apt-get install glibc-devel [sudo] password for eric: Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done E: Couldn't find package glibc-devel eric@Chad:~$
[23:24] <Eric7> lol
[23:24] <Fryguy--> Eric7: like I told you a while ago, ust apt-cache to identify the correct names of the packages that you need
[23:24] <kitche> DigitalNinja: I dont either at least not anymore :(
[23:24] <imaginator> Eric7: try Administration -> Synaptic    perhaps.  apt-cache search is also useful
[23:24] <Eric7> k lemme try
[23:24] <rand0m> Fryguy--: well, you're a good man for helping everyone so much.  whenever i pop in, it's always you answering like 10 questions at a time, one after another.  Truly good work man, thanks again.
[23:25] <Fryguy--> rand0m: i haven't really left
[23:25] <Fryguy--> since 11 last night :)
[23:25] <JoshuaP0x> BRB
[23:25] <rand0m> lol, we're same timezone eh ?
[23:25] <Fryguy--> rand0m: going for the 24hour marathon session
[23:25] <Fryguy--> rand0m: EST
[23:25] <rand0m> same
[23:25] <DigitalNinja> Thanks all
[23:25] <DigitalNinja> I'll do some searching
[23:25] <Forest> I'm having some trouble installing java in firefox 3
[23:25] <Jane_ux> how can i do so a user only cansafe
[23:25] <Eric7> apt-cache search glibc-devel doesnt work what exactly is the command?
[23:25] <shingalated> Why would I get: "The requested URL / was not found on this server." for both of my sites on my server?  I am 99% sure that my virtualhosts files are correct...are there other things I should be checking?
[23:26] <Fryguy--> Eric7: it works, you are just searching for the wrong thing
[23:26] <Forest> I'm having some trouble installing java in firefox 3--Hardy Heron, 8.04
[23:26] <Fryguy--> try searching for just glibc for example
[23:26] <rand0m> Fryguy--:  gotta give yourself a break at some point though buddy - i've heard of people going into cardiac arrest after insane marathons like that.
[23:26] <rand0m> thena gain that was with gaming, not helping linux noobs lol
[23:26] <powertool08> Fryguy--: I think I'm going to purge and reinstall, so when I copy my private key, I copy id_rsa.pub from ~/.ssh to my remote host correct?
[23:26] <Jane_ux> <unconvertable> how can i do so a user only can save documents in a specific folder eg. /home/user/Documents
[23:26] <brandano> Good evening. I just installed Ubuntu on a pc, got an ATI card with the "unsupported" ATI drivers, and everything seems to work fine. However, how can I tell X to use a refresh rate higher than 60 hz? Do I have to hack into xorg.conf or is there a more user friendly (trn: for dummies) procedure?
[23:26] <Decepticon> how do i tell ncurses to make lines instead of dashes
[23:26] <tomd123> Forest: search for sun java 6 plugin package
[23:26] <Fryguy--> powertool08: it gets catted to authorized_keys of the other machine
[23:26] <eck> powertool08: .pub is your public key
[23:26] <Eric7> E: Invalid operation glibc

[23:27] <Forest> tomd123: I've installed java already as it instructs
[23:27] <tomd123> Forest: you also have to install the plugin
=== Shadow_X|zZzZz is now known as Shadow_X
[23:27] <Fryguy--> Eric7: apt-cache search glibc
[23:27] <Forest> tomd123: and put links in the firefox plugins folders
[23:27] <imaginator> powertool08: ~/.ssh/authorized_keys I believe
[23:27] <Fryguy--> Eric7: btw, it's probably glibc6-devel
[23:27] <tomd123> Forest: no, don't do that
[23:27] <Forest> tomd123: ok, how do I install it?
[23:27] <tomd123> Forest: the package should handle all of that for you
[23:27] <Forest> tomd123: the package?
[23:28] <powertool08> Fryguy--: and what if the remote machine is WinXP with putty?
[23:28] <Eric7> k big list
[23:28] <Fryguy--> Forest: install sun-java-plugin or something like that
[23:28] <ryanakca> What's the catalan channel
[23:28] <Fryguy--> powertool08: ?
[23:28] <Forest> tomd123: I have it...
[23:28] <Fryguy--> powertool08: putty is an ssh client, not a server
[23:28] <Forest> tomd123: just a sec
[23:28] <Jane_ux> <unconvertable> how can i do so a user only can save documents in a specific folder??? eg. in  /home/user/Documents
[23:28] <Storrgie> I just setup a raid 5 array, I can see the array in ubuntu but I cannot mount it
[23:29] <Fryguy--> Storrgie: what did you use to create the array
[23:29] <powertool08> Fryguy--: I realize this, you said to cat it to the authorized_keys on the other machine, other machine referring to remote host right? Does XP have an authorized_keys file?
[23:29] <tomd123> Forest: sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin
[23:29] <Eric7> found glibc-doc - GNU C Library: Documentation?
[23:29] <Forest> tomd123: i have it
[23:29] <Storrgie> Fryguy--: I know we have talked before, I originally used mdadm to create the array, but I decided for cross compatability to create the array in my bios and setup fakeraid with dmraid
[23:29] <Fryguy--> powertool08: xp doesn't have an ssh server.  Whatever server you are using you'll have to read it's documentation to see where to play public keys
[23:29] <Forest> tomd123: I think i might know the problem, trying to fix right now
[23:30] <tomd123> Forest: just fire up firefox, what's the problem?
[23:30] <Fryguy--> Storrgie: no idea how to help you then, sorry
[23:30] <brandano> Fryguy--: I have installed an SSH server on Win2000 before, though
[23:30] <Fryguy--> Storrgie: btw, mdadm is more cross compatible than fakeraid
[23:30] <brandano> OpenSSH I think
[23:30] <Forest> tomd123: it doesn't show java is installed
[23:30] <Fryguy--> brandano: yes, not part of the operating system, a completely separate application
[23:30] <Forest> tomd123: but I'm using firefox in another folder than the official one, that may be why
[23:31] <tomd123> Forest: ya..
[23:31] <Fryguy--> brandano: so like i just said, he's going to have to read the documentation for the implementation he chose to see where to put keys, since there is no standard location
[23:31] <powertool08> Fryguy--: But the xp machine would be acting as a server unless I'm trying to log into it right? I want to log into my Ubuntu machine from XP Ubuntu=server:XP=client
[23:31] <powertool08> Fryguy--: *wouldn't
[23:31] <Fryguy--> powertool08: right, so why are you putting your public key there
[23:31] <CaptObvious> anyone here like a challenge?
[23:31] <Storrgie> Fryguy--: not with windows that I knew... but I am having a mounting issue so can we talk about that?
[23:31] <spukisputnik> xchat???
[23:31] <imaginator> Forest: if you're using Firefox in a different folder you need to symlink the extension to the jdk
[23:31] <Fryguy--> powertool08: your public key goes on the server, not the client
[23:31] <powertool08> Fryguy--: I meant private key
[23:31] <CaptObvious> I have a box running ubuntu server on which I have recently edited the fstab, accidentally adding an invalid argument and rebooted.  now the remount of the root partition as rw on boot is failing so the root partition is mounted as ro.
[23:31] <tomd123> Forest: well if you're compiling your own, you might have to manually add the java plugin
[23:31] <Fryguy--> Storrgie: i have no idea how to fix your mounting issue if you are using dmraid
[23:32] <CaptObvious> the only access I have to the box is via ssh but for some reason it won't authenticate via sudo or su with a ro root filesystem, if I could get a root shell I could fix it, I just don't know how to get it to authenticate su or sudo while the root partition is ro, any ideas?
[23:32] <Eric7> how do i decide what in the list = glibc-devel
[23:32] <Eric7> there a libc dev
[23:32] <Forest> tomd123, imaginator: yes just let me see if moving my folder to the one java uses will work
[23:32] <Storrgie> has anyone in this room used dmraid?
[23:32] <Eric7> inux-libc-dev - Linux Kernel Headers for development
[23:32] <Eric7> linux*
[23:32] <Fryguy--> powertool08: i'm completely confused now, we went from you saying you were using putty as a server, to you putting public key on client and private key on server, to xp being a server, not xp is a client.  I have no idea what you are talking about at this point.  Why don't you try starting over and explaining what you are doing and what the problem is, from the beginning. and be careful with getting things backwards because it
[23:33] <Metatron> im trying to get an ltsp client to boot off this machine, no luck...maybe the problem is the dhcp.config it is set to /ltsp/pxelinux.0  ubuntu docs say change it to /ltsp/vmlinuz.etherboot   but there is not file there, not even a /ltsp folder  ?
[23:33] <Cybodog> what is the substitution for /etc/libnss-ldap.conf?
[23:33] <CaptObvious> nobody has any ideas?
[23:33] <DIL> chroot
[23:33] <powertool08> Fryguy--: to resummarize, purge and reinstall for a new clean config/keys (backups 1st next time, I know) then openssh server on ubuntu machine, I take the private key which is in ~/.ssh and copy to windows client machine, then XP client connects thru putty to Ubuntu server
[23:33]  * Cybodog has looked for it, I can only find that /etc/libnss-ldap.conf was removed, but no ref to how to config those parameters.
[23:34] <imaginator> Forest: from what I recall it's particular about where the libjavaplugin_oji.so is.  Java expects the ~/.mozilla/plugins version to be a symbolic link last time I tried it.
[23:34] <Storrgie> I need help setting up my creative X FI soundcard!
[23:34] <matthew__> !rockbox
[23:34] <ubottu> rockbox is an open source firmware replacement for audio players from Archos, iRiver, Apple (iPod), and iAudio. See http://www.rockbox.org/ to get started!
[23:34] <Fryguy--> powertool08: use putty-gen to create a key on windows. putty needs keys to be in .ppk format, not the format that openssh spits out by default
[23:34] <Eric7> anyone know if glibc-devel =/= linux-libc-dev - Linux Kernel Headers for development?
[23:34] <Fryguy--> Eric7: yes probably
[23:34] <Eric7> k
[23:35] <brandano> What's the easy way to switch screen refresh rate?
[23:35] <guillaume> hi all
[23:35] <brandano> I only have 60hz in the options available
[23:35] <Fryguy--> brandano: system | screens and graphics, or just edit xorg.conf manually
[23:35] <ubunubi> is there a modifier key that can be held down to delete a file w/o sending it to the trash?
[23:35] <guillaume> I'm having difficulty with sound player like Rytmbox
[23:35] <Fryguy--> ubunubi: shift
[23:35] <guillaume> all of them actualy
[23:36] <guillaume> the track loads but start to play
[23:36] <Cybodog> and I can not set my ldap w/kerberos because the config file was moved with out any ref to what replaced it.
[23:36] <powertool08> Fryguy--: Ok, I think I have it now
[23:36] <Eric7> E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable) E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?   huh?
[23:36] <brandano> Fryguy--: that's what I was afraid of. Oh well, hopefully it'll be easier than the old times when I had to compile the Nvidia drivers manually
[23:36] <imaginator> brandano:  Preferences -> Screen Resolution or the xrandr program in a terminal
[23:36] <Fryguy--> Eric7: do you have synaptic or another package manager open?
[23:36] <Eric7> yes
[23:36] <shingalated> Anyone know anything about virtualhosts?  the apache channel is not much help
[23:36] <Fryguy--> Eric7: close it
[23:36] <Eric7> k
[23:36] <Fryguy--> shingalated: ask a question, don't ask to ask
[23:37] <brandano> imaginator: only works if the dropdown allows me more than one refresh rate, though. I think the monitor wasn't detected properly
[23:37] <shingalated> Why would I get: "The requested URL / was not found on this server." for both of my sites on my server?  I am 99% sure that my virtualhosts files are correct...are there other things I should be checking?
[23:37] <brandano> shingalated: what sort of vhost?
[23:37] <ciscu> hi all
[23:37] <guillaume> why can
[23:37] <brandano> namebased or are you assigning an IP per vhost?
[23:37] <Eric7> linux-libc-dev is already the newest version. linux-libc-dev set to manual installed. E: Couldn't find package Linux?
[23:37] <Fryguy--> shingalated: namevirtualhosts or ip-based?
[23:38] <Forest> so this is what I had: all my desktop shortcuts were to /usr/lib/firefox-3.0/firefox3/firefox
[23:38] <guillaume> In totem I the song loads
[23:38] <Fryguy--> Eric7: so that's not he right one
[23:38] <guillaume> but, wont start to play
[23:38] <Eric7> k
[23:38] <Forest> because the firefox that came with the distro of ubuntu didn't seem to work
[23:38] <guillaume> I can see title and everything
[23:38] <ciscu> how can I set system variables? I want to share the same variable for all shells(processes)
[23:38] <Fryguy--> ciscu: be more specific?
[23:38] <Forest> I tried to install the java plugin for my own firefox, but that didn't work
[23:38] <imaginator> Eric7: try installing: libc6-dev or build-essentials IIRC
[23:39] <Fryguy--> ciscu: add it to the startup script for your shell (probably ~/.bashrc unless you changed your shell
[23:39] <Forest> so then I hoped the packages would've allowed the default firefox to have java plugins
=== FRiEd|BnC is now known as FriedCPU
[23:39] <Eric7> k
[23:39] <s3a> y wont installing gnash help youtube work in epiphany?
[23:39] <ciscu> Fryguy: Ok... I want like a global variable, but it will be changing for every process
[23:40] <shingalated> brandano: a name based one, like nameone.com goes to /varwww/nameone/index.html and nametwo.com goes to /var/www/nametwo/index.html
[23:40] <Fryguy--> ciscu: be more specific
[23:40] <alphaman1101> how do i tell what version of wine i have?
[23:40] <Fryguy--> ciscu: sounds like you are going to need to write a program and use some IPC to track state
[23:40] <shingalated> (both are on the same server)
[23:40] <Fryguy--> alphaman1101: wine --version should tell you
[23:40] <guillaume> why does my song wont start to play
[23:40] <Fryguy--> shingalated: what happens if you visit the site by ip
[23:40] <Fryguy--> and not by hostname
[23:40] <alphaman1101> hey can i post three lines?
[23:41] <brandano> shingalated: the example from the docs works usually fine. Pitfalls can be in the listen directive
[23:41] <Starnestommy> alphaman1101: use a pastebin
[23:41] <Eric7> libc6-deveric@Chad:~$ sudo apt-get install build-essentials IIRC Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done E: Couldn't find package build-essentials?
[23:41] <Fryguy--> Eric7: build-essential, no s
[23:41] <alphaman1101> for three lines.... seems kinda stupid but i guess rules are rules
[23:41] <brandano> shingalated: also, setting up SSL only usually works for one domain out of the lot
[23:41] <ciscu> I have a loop program where into each loop is executed a script, this script change a variable, and I want to get this variable at next loop
[23:41] <Eric7> huh?
[23:41] <shingalated> If i visit by IP I got the same error because there is no default site
[23:41] <Fryguy--> brandano: 1 domain per ip
[23:42] <Fryguy--> shingalated: if you visit by IP and don't get any site to come up then your config isn't being read correctly
[23:42] <alphaman1101> http://clubmckinley.pastebin.com/m2e77603a whats it talking about
[23:42] <Forest> fryguy--, tomd123, imaginator: so this is what I had: all my desktop shortcuts were to /usr/lib/firefox-3.0/firefox3/firefox . I dled firefox from the site and put it in the firefox3 folder because the firefox that came with the distro of ubuntu didn't seem to work. I tried to install the java plugin for my own firefox, but that didn't work. so then I hoped the packages would've allowed the default firefox to have j
[23:42] <Forest> ava plugins. But that didn't work either...
[23:42] <brandano> Fryguy--: from what he said he means a namebased host, hence 1 ip, several domains
[23:43] <Fryguy--> alphaman1101: so you are running version 0.9.59
[23:43] <shingalated> Well I copied the first one off my old server which was working fine, the next two attempts were from scratch, the next few trys were created through the webmin apache config
[23:43] <Fryguy--> brandano: yes and i was just being pedantic about the advice you gave for SSL, which wasn't 100% correct. I just filled in a detail
[23:43] <alphaman1101> Fryguy-- whats that warning message?
[23:43] <msjdbgjd> Was 8.04.1 put up for download today?  I see nothing mentioned about its release on the ubuntu web site.
[23:43] <Fryguy--> brandano: does it apply to him, probably not
[23:43] <Fryguy--> alphaman1101: no idea
[23:43] <Fryguy--> msjdbgjd: no
[23:43] <imaginator> Forest: http://www.java.com/en/download/help/5000010500.xml#14
[23:43] <Fryguy--> msjdbgjd: you'll know when it's available
[23:44] <ciscu> Fryguy:  I have a loop program where into each loop is executed a script, this script change a variable, and I want to get this variable at next loop
[23:44] <msjdbgjd> thanks

[23:45] <alphaman1101> How do i upgrade wine to 1.0
[23:45] <Fryguy--> Eric7: just pastebin the results of "apt-cache search glibc"
[23:45] <brandano> shingalated: are you connecting to the server using the domain path in your browser? namebased vhosts rely on the browser communicating what domain they expect to see
[23:45] <ciscu> Fryguy: ok... where can I ask for this?
[23:45] <Fryguy--> alphaman1101: you wait for it to become available in ubuntu (which it probably won't until october, for version 8.10)
[23:45] <brandano> if you want one to come out by default then it has tio be defined outside the vhost directive
[23:45] <Fryguy--> ciscu: #programming
[23:45] <Fryguy--> ciscu: #linux
[23:45] <ciscu> thanx
[23:45] <ghindo> Could someone help me setup a program to start on system startup on a command line system?
[23:46] <Eric7> here u go
[23:46] <Fryguy--> ghindo: make a startup script for it, put it in /etc/init.d and use rc-update
[23:46] <Eric7> i got kicked lol
[23:46] <imaginator> Eric7: sudo apt-get install libc6-dev      Most likely if you need that you want this too: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[23:47] <Eric7> i got build essential
[23:47] <adpereira> hello to everyone, I've noticed that my screensaver no longer works, instead the screen blinks for a sec. I'm using Hardy Heron with Nvidia drivers. Has this happened to anyone around?
[23:47] <kitche> Eric7: probably because your using mibbit.com
[23:47] <Fryguy--> Eric7: if you got build essential, then you already have glibc most likely, what's next on the list of things that you need
[23:47] <Forest> imaginator: been there
[23:47] <matthew__> hey guys, banshee doesn't seem to see my Ipod, even though amorak does, anyone know what could be happening?
[23:47] <gway9000> adpereira: me too
[23:47] <ghindo> Fryguy--: Thanks
[23:47] <shingalated> brando: I am not really sure.... these are my config files, they are both in site-available symlinked to sites-available http://pastebin.com/d7991bee
[23:47] <Fryguy--> !repeat | matthew__
[23:47] <ubottu> matthew__: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[23:47] <imaginator> Forest: did the ln -s ... command work?
[23:49] <brandano> shingalated: ok, does your DNS resolve the two domains to the correct IP?
[23:49] <adpereira> i thought it was a matter of the nvidia drivers or may be xorg.conf, but tried reinstalling with EnvyNG and sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg with no success.
[23:49] <Fryguy--> shingalated: did you specify namevirtualhost for the interface you are listening on anywhere
[23:49] <Eric7> in all i need glibc-devel, python-gobject-devel, and libglib2-devel packages
[23:49] <imaginator> Forest: by the way, you can confirm if the ln worked by using ls -l in ~/.mozilla/plugins for the java plugin, or with a file manager.
[23:49] <Gnutoo> hello,my brother has an eeepc 700 and he liked the xandros interface but needed more software so he installed ubuntu...but now there is ubuntu MID edition...is it possible to install software such as vlc,wine,amsn etc...in the MID edition...and i suppose i will have to customise the kenrel no?
[23:49] <shingalated> brandano:  yes if i ping the hosts externally they resolve to the correct IP
[23:49] <Fryguy--> shingalated: i set up my virtualhosts using a completely different method (ip based virtualhost entries and then servername directives)
[23:49] <drod> I need to make room for my solaris installation, how can I reduce the partition for ubuntu?
[23:50] <Fryguy--> drod: use gparted
[23:50] <shingalated> Fryguy, can I see your config?
[23:50] <Fryguy--> shingalated: no
[23:50] <Forest> imaginator: it seems i may be missing a folder: ns7/lib
[23:50] <ikonia> drod: use a tool such as gparted, although shrinking any partition comes with a risk
[23:50] <gway9000> adpereira: my box freezes on some then i have to reboot
[23:50] <Forest> imaginator: nvm lol
[23:50] <drod> Fryguy, thanks...so I use gparted livecd right?
[23:50] <Fryguy--> drod: sure
[23:50] <Eric7>  python-gobject-devel?
[23:50] <lenix_> any idea why i can't ping other ubuntu machines on my lan ? i'm also getting 127.0.1.1 ip when i ping my pc hostname
[23:51] <Storrgie> anyone use DMRAID? I need a little help
[23:51] <Eric7> gonna do a search
[23:51] <imaginator> drod: google for resize ext3
[23:51] <Forest> imaginator: would it have anything to do with a
[23:51] <ikonia> lenix_: because your hostname will be mapped to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts
[23:51] <Fryguy--> lenix_: what's the ip of the other machine you are trying to ping, and what are you typing to ping it?
[23:51] <imaginator> drod: there should be a tool for specifically doing that I think
[23:51] <Forest> imaginator: would it have anything to do with a libnullplugin.so?
[23:51] <drod> Fryguy, thanks...I will try now..I guess that you dont see me around it would mean I failed...solaris says I need to manually print and rewrite grub
[23:51] <Fryguy--> lenix_: and getting 127.0.0.1 when you ping your own machine is perfectly normal, 127.0.0.1 is the localhost loopback interface
[23:51] <drod> imaginator, thanks, I think I will try live cd
[23:51] <imaginator> Forest: no.  the libnullplugin.so is the default Mozilla plugin.  It's displayed when no other plugin can handle the web page object.
[23:51] <ikonia> Fryguy--: it's only normal if you don't have an ip address
[23:52] <lenix_> Fryguy--,  /home/lenix# ping 192.168.0.1
[23:52] <lenix_> PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
[23:52] <lenix_> and it hangs on that last line
[23:52] <Forest> imaginator: do you know where I should put the ns7 folder?
[23:52] <ikonia> lenix_: is this a wired or wirless lan ?
[23:52] <imaginator> Forest: it should come with the JDK or JRE
[23:52] <lenix_> i also can't ping my machine from the other ubuntu machine
[23:52] <Forest> imaginator: i have a mozilla/plugins, a firefox-3.0/plugins and etc
[23:52] <lenix_> ikonia,  wired
[23:52] <gway9000> ensure host name is listed where 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts
[23:52] <shingalated> Fryguy, no where should I add that?
[23:52] <ikonia> lenix_: ok, so "ifconfig eth0"
[23:52] <ikonia> lenix_: can you put that in a pastebin please.
[23:53] <Fryguy--> shingalated: at the top of one of the site-availables, or in the main httpd.conf
[23:53] <lenix_> ikonia,  eth0 is the lan socket for my adsl modem
[23:53] <lenix_> eth1 is the network one
[23:53] <Cew27> anyone looking for a forum that isnt overcrowded join www.linux-forums.co.uk
[23:53] <Eric7> nothing found for python-gobject-devel
[23:53] <ikonia> lenix_: ok, so show me eth1
[23:53] <Eric7> so i search gobject?
[23:53] <Fryguy--> Eric7: just search for gobject then
[23:53] <Fryguy--> Eric7: common sense is helpful in situations like this
[23:54] <lenix_> ikonia,  http://pastebin.com/m5c1e12f5
[23:54] <Eric7> python-gobject-dev - Development headers for the GObject python bindings sounds good?
[23:55] <ikonia> lenix_: that card has no ip address, thats why you can't ping anything
[23:55] <lenix_> ikonia,  any idea how can i fix that?
[23:55] <ikonia> lenix_: give it an ip address
[23:55] <gway9000> lenix_: ensure host name is listed where 127.0.0.1 is in /etc/hosts
[23:55] <Fryguy--> that's eth1, where is eth0
[23:56] <lenix_> Fryguy--, eth0 is the ethernet used for my adsl modem, which is working just fine
[23:56] <Fryguy--> lenix_: and what is eth1
[23:56] <lenix_> is my lan card
[23:56] <Forest> imaginator: after copying links to every plug-in thing, java still does not work
[23:56] <Fryguy--> lenix_: .. how do you have your network set up
[23:56] <imaginator> Forest: that's because you can't copy the link, unfortunately
[23:56] <imaginator> Forest: it depends on a symbolic link from what I recall
[23:57] <imaginator> Forest: I'll paste how mine is setup
[23:57] <Forest> imaginator: no, like, I used the command on all the directories
[23:57] <ariqs> is pidgin updated for ubuntu yet?
[23:57] <lenix_> Fryguy--,  ? normally, connected to a router
[23:57] <Forest> imaginator: sure
[23:57] <Fryguy--> ariqs: getdeb.net
[23:57] <lenix_> Fryguy--, i have 2 ethernets in my case, one for the adsl modem, one for lan router
[23:58] <Fryguy--> lenix_: so why not just plug the router into adsl?
[23:58] <Storrgie> has anyone setup a creative XFI card ?!
[23:58] <Fryguy--> and then plug all of the computers in that, and not create a separate lan subnet?
[23:58] <EagleScreen> ubuntu has its own gspca driver isnt?
[23:58] <BluntObject> Storrgie: What is an XFI card?
[23:58] <Eric7> got gobject but i guess i still need the last one
[23:58] <imaginator> Forest: http://paste.ubuntu.com/24837/
[23:58] <Storrgie> creative X-FI
[23:58] <EagleScreen> what happens if i want to install and use another gspca driver?
[23:59] <Storrgie> sound card
[23:59] <Fryguy--> Storrgie: http://www.google.com/search?q=ubuntu+xfi&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
[23:59] <Eric7> libglib2-devel
[23:59] <protractor> hello, do anyone know a new package of LICQ that include the same icq fix that the new pidgin from getdeb.net have?
[23:59] <BluntObject> Thx. Nice.
[23:59] <imaginator> Forest: does that make sense?
[23:59] <EagleScreen> i would like compile and install other gspca
[23:59] <lenix_> Fryguy--, its a network between 2 houses, we're not sharing internet, but only for data transfer etc..
[23:59] <lenix_> so each house have its adsl
[00:00] <lenix_> i hope you understand :P
[00:00] <Forest> imaginator: my firefox doesn't show java though
[00:00] <Fryguy--> lenix_: well you'll have to update /etc/network/interfaces so that eth1 gets an IP, and then you'll have to add a static route to the routing table for it
[00:00] <Cew27> anyone looking for a forum that isnt overcrowded join www.linux-forums.co.uk
[00:00] <imaginator> Forest: ok.  What does ls -l list for the libjavaplugin_oji.so?    Does that path exist?
[00:00] <rizkhan> hi
[00:00] <Forest> imaginator: wait, is the link directly to the libjava thing?
[00:00] <Fryguy--> lenix_: to go alongside the default route to your adsl modem, otherwise you'll be on 2 separate subnets that won't be able to communicate
[00:00] <imaginator> Forest: yes
[00:01] <Forest> imaginator: because currently it is in the /ns7 folder
[00:01] <lenix_> ikonia, http://pastebin.com/m1f85472f  .. here is my hosts file
[00:01] <rizkhan> i have a small question regarding ubuntu
[00:01] <rizkhan> if anyone coudl help
[00:01] <Fryguy--> rizkhan: ask a question, don't ask to ask
[00:01] <Forest> imaginator: i'll fix that right now
[00:01] <xhuangzi> rizkhan, Don't ask to to ask
[00:02] <xhuangzi> beat me to it
[00:02] <rizkhan> is there a way to specify if i want to run an applicaiton on cpu2 if have a dual core system
[00:02] <Storrgie> Jack_Sparrow: ever setup raid?
[00:02] <rizkhan> i can compile using -j
[00:02] <Fryguy--> rizkhan: why not just allow linux to manage processes for you?  It's going to do a better job of managing cpu resources than you will
[00:02] <xhuangzi> rizkhan yes
[00:02] <imaginator> rizkhan: the taskset program
[00:02] <s3a> do feature suggestions go into brainstorm or elsewhere?
[00:03] <protractor> no patch/new package for LICQ?
[00:03] <matthew__> how can I change the default program that runs when I insert a Music Player?
[00:03] <lenix_> Fryguy--, please be a bit patient with me, im still all new to the stuff.. here is my /etc/network http://pastebin.com/m54ade14b
[00:03] <Fryguy--> protractor: no
[00:03] <boogieman> sup dudes, i need some little help ..... i have ubuntu 8.04 with the latests wine, i ran utorrent.exe  and it runs ok, (i've been downloading and the stuff is ok), but whenever i ran it, the executable dissapears.... i.e. /home/user/utorrent/utorrent.exe <-- disappears i can no longer find it and firefox does not list ... what could possibly be going on here ?
[00:03] <lenix_> can you tell me what to do exactly ?
[00:03] <pulse00> hi all. very strange problem here: when changing the display mode in the ati control center to "BigDesktop", xorg switches into that mode, also the xorg.conf is changed. but after a restart, my second monitor is simply a clone of the first again.
[00:03] <rizkhan> well .. m running 2 Open dynamic engine apps ..  n the other cpu is idle .. so want to use that
[00:03] <Terabyte> hey, on ssh, how can i search for a file (say i know its called home.php)
[00:03] <EagleScreen> if i compile and install a new gspca driver will it replace the default gspca in Ubuntu??
[00:03] <Fryguy--> lenix_: you'll have to add eth1 to that list, should just be able to do auto eth1
[00:04] <supertanker> How can I put ubuntu on my flash drive?
[00:04] <bazhang> !usb

[00:04] <protractor> Fryguy: when it will released?
[00:05] <lukuspukus> matthew__, system - preferences - preferred applications
[00:05] <lenix_> ok Fryguy-- , i added auto eth1 to that file
[00:05] <Jack_Sparrow> supertanker pendrivelinux.com
[00:05] <Fryguy--> protractor: no idea, this is ubuntu, not #licq, go talk to the developers of the software and see if they are working on it
[00:05] <imaginator> EagleScreen: I'm not sure.  I would think make install might.  You can see in the Makefile for gspca (which IIRC is a camera driver set).
[00:05] <protractor> ok thx
[00:05] <Fryguy--> lenix_: k, now sudo dhclient eth1
[00:05] <Forest> imaginator: it is working, thanks
[00:05] <Jack_Sparrow> protractor the patch is done just waiting for testing
[00:05] <Eric7> configure: error: pangocairo >= 1.16 is required to build swfdec....

=== node357a is now known as node357
[00:06] <Eric7> at least i guess im closer
[00:06] <Eric7> lol...
[00:06] <Fryguy--> Eric7: so find/upgrade pangocairo
[00:06] <wgato> i am trying to install from a livecd but the partitioner doesnt see my sata drive (its new not been used before)
[00:06] <supertanker> Thanks Fryguy--
[00:06] <ks3> Terabyte, check out the find command
[00:06] <EagleScreen> is it possible remove the current gspca driver from Ubuntu?
[00:06] <Fryguy--> wgato: does your bios see the drive
[00:06] <Tux2K8> I want to install pidgin 2.4.3 on 7.10 , how do I find what dependencies do I need to install in order for it to work????
[00:07] <ariqs> ok, how do I upgrade just pidgen with apt-get? sudo apt-get update pidgin tries to make me update everything
[00:07] <Fryguy--> Tux2K8: .debs track dependencies for you
[00:07] <Tux2K8> I dont use debs...
[00:07] <rizkhan> cant seem to find taskset ..
[00:07] <Tux2K8> no 2.4.3 deb for 7.10
[00:07] <Fryguy--> ariqs: any reason you don't just update everything
[00:07] <Jack_Sparrow> Tux2K8 it will be uphill battle
[00:07] <supertanker> ariqs: Isn't it upgrade, not update?
[00:07] <Eric7> apt-cache search pangocairo
[00:07] <Eric7> nothing found...
[00:07] <supertanker> ariqs: update iirc updates apt otse;f
[00:07] <Gazingson> hi
[00:07] <wgato> fryguy:  i think so.  the bios on this new mb only lets me change the boot options and hard drive is listed and when i chose it, it reports no OS found
[00:07] <ariqs> yeah, it is upgrade actually, my bad. But that's what I had tried. I just typed it wrong in here.
[00:07] <rizkhan> got it .. thanks fryguy
[00:07] <Eric7> should i search for pango lol?
[00:07] <Fryguy--> Eric7: seriously, use some common sense here, the same thing has happened to you 3x now and you haven't figured out what you need to do yet?
[00:07] <ariqs> Fryguy: I can't possibly download all that nonsense on dialup
[00:07] <supertanker> itself*
[00:08] <Gazingson> how do i download programs made for windows
[00:08] <Gazingson> ?
[00:08] <Fryguy--> !wine | Gazingson
[00:08] <ubottu> Gazingson: WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information, and see !AppDB for application compatibility.
[00:08] <Tux2K8> Jack_Sparrow : well  I dont have any other way to do it.... on 7.10
[00:08] <Terabyte> ks3 only ever seems to find it in the directory where its located
[00:08] <Fryguy--> ariqs: you really should
[00:09] <ariqs> not happening.
[00:09] <Fryguy--> ariqs: anyways, just use apt-get upgdate and then apt-get install pidgin
[00:09] <Eric7> guile-gnome0-gtk - Guile bindings for GTK+, libglade, Pango and ATK?
[00:09] <lenix__> Fryguy--, I got disconnected for a while after I added that line to the interfaces file
[00:09] <lenix__> ;/
[00:09] <Jack_Sparrow> Tux2K8 You wont get it done the way you are trying
[00:09] <ariqs> thanks
[00:09] <ks3> Terabyte, In the directory you run it from? You can tell it where to search... find /path/to/start/search home.php
[00:09] <Tux2K8> Jack_Sparrow:  what ur saying is : no 2.4.3 for 7.10?
[00:09] <imaginator> wgato: you might try seeing in a terminal if dmesg lists your sata drive.  There should also be a way to do that with the live cd too, perhaps via the System menu
[00:10] <Eric7> libpango1.0-dev - Development files for the Pango?
[00:10] <Eric7> sound good?
[00:10] <guillaume> please help someone that has no sound sine last update.. :(
[00:10] <ariqs> Fryguy: is my current configure going be replaced and i'll lose my accounts?
[00:10] <Fryguy--> Eric7: no

[00:10] <Fryguy--> ariqs: no
[00:10] <Jack_Sparrow> Tux2K8 certainly not right away or as soon as the hardy version
[00:10] <quio> Hi.  I am using Ubuntu Gutsy 7.10  The other day when I turned on my Dell d510 laptop my wireless connection would not turn on.  It seems to turn off when the OS boots up.  The only way to get it working is to hit the Fn key and F1.  This however makes the laptop reboot on on boot up the wireless works.  Is there a config file I need to adjust to tell the os to turn on the wireless on boot?
[00:11] <guillaume> I dont understand why the song wont just start
[00:11] <Eric7> python-cairo-dev - Python cairo bindings: development files?
[00:11] <lenix__> should I restart after adding eth1 auto ?
[00:11] <xfls> can someone tell me how to set konversation text charset to cp1251?
[00:12] <Fryguy--> guillaume: probably using wrong sound infrastructre, review your sound configuration and make sure everything is working.  If you are playing back sound as a user, make sure your user is part of the right groups to enable access to the sound device
[00:12] <Fryguy--> Eric7: probably
[00:12] <Eric7> k ^^
[00:13] <ariqs> Fryguy: it says pidgin is already the newest version still
[00:13] <lenix__> I still can't ping 192.168.0.1 , any suggestion ? :S
[00:13] <guillaume> Fryguy: when I do a sound test
[00:13] <guillaume> nothing
[00:13] <Fryguy--> ariqs: then the newest version isn't in hardy yet, you can get it from getdeb.lnet if you want
[00:13] <Fryguy--> guillaume: well you need to resolve that before you go screwing around with media players
[00:13] <imaginator> guillaume: what type of sound card are you using?  does lspci list it?
[00:13] <brandano> ariqs: there was an article on slashdot today saying that the ICQ network has started refusing alternative clients
[00:13] <Fryguy--> guillaume: try using a different mixer device or something
[00:13] <boogieman> sup dudes, i need some little help ..... i have ubuntu 8.04 with the latests wine, i ran utorrent.exe  and it runs ok, (i've been downloading and the stuff is ok), but whenever i ran it, the executable dissapears.... i.e. /home/user/utorrent/utorrent.exe <-- disappears i can no longer find it and firefox does not list ... what could possibly be going on here ?  ALSO if i copy it back to the folder, still disappear after runing it...
[00:14] <joshual> I haven't tried to use synthesizer apps for many years, but I remmember way back when being able to use pretty powerful apps (cakewalk etc) on my now way way old machine (and windows). Now (as then) I have a pretty decent machine for the times, but when I attempt (at least in linux, havent tried in windows (dont have it installed)) to use these types of apps its a pain because i get breaking...
[00:14] <joshual> ...up and sound problems like crackling etc...
[00:14] <Fryguy--> boogieman: how are you running it
[00:14] <guillaume> lol it was working great before hardy
[00:14] <Eric7> checking for PANGO... no configure: error: pangocairo >= 1.16 is required to build swfdec
[00:14] <ariqs> brandano: purposely, or just because they are changing protocols?
[00:14] <Fryguy--> guillaume: yes, and the sound infrastructure completely changed when upgrading to hardy
[00:14] <AMLNXUSR> Can anyone recommend and compiler tool i can use on .tar.bz files?
[00:14] <brandano> purposely, it sems
[00:15] <Eric7> so i guess i need pango dev files?
[00:15] <boogieman> like this http://news.softpedia.com/news/uTorrent-under-Ubuntu-in-3-Easy-Steps-49037.shtml
=== rizkhan is now known as I
[00:15] <brandano> But that's me, always expecting the worse from people
[00:15] <boogieman> i created a executable @ the desktop
[00:15] <Fryguy--> AMLNXUSR: a tar.bz2 file is a compressed tarball, you use tar -xjf to decompress it
[00:15] <ariqs> fryguy: getdeb says to remove my current version before installing new version..
[00:15] <imaginator> joshual: that may be a driver issue, unfortunately.  What sound system is the program using?
[00:15] <guillaume> I think that even if the device would not be corectly config the song would still "play"
[00:15] <Fryguy--> ariqs: so then do that
[00:15] <boogieman> but whenever i run it, the executable from the folder disappears
[00:15] <tqc> hello
[00:15] <boogieman> hello
=== I is now known as Guest54058
[00:15] <ariqs> fryguy: then I'll lose my account data won't i?
=== Guest54058 is now known as rizkhan
[00:15] <Fryguy--> ariqs: no
[00:15] <joshual> imaginator: apparently most of the ones i want to use are jack
[00:16] <joshual> use jack
[00:16] <BLAHLOL32> how do i format my thumbdrive?
[00:16] <tqc> anyone know how to fix the problem with videos appearing like on negative film?
[00:16] <AMLNXUSR> ok thnx fryguy

The only way to get it working is to hit the Fn key and F1.  This however makes the laptop reboot on and when it boots up again the wireless works.  If I shut down and start it up again it is off.  Is there a config file I need to adjust to tell the os to t
[00:16] <quio> urn on the wireless on boot?
[00:16] <alphaman1101> my cd drive is messing up and wont open i dont know why. Is there a command that i can force it to open?
[00:16] <satan_> hello everyone
[00:16] <brandano> ariqs: you should be able to back it up, but in any case I doubt it gets removed with the program?
[00:16] <Fryguy--> tgc: using mplayer?
[00:16] <tqc> mplayer, totem, anything, ubuntu 8.10
[00:16] <imaginator> guillaume: let's start from the bottom up.  First see if the device has a driver attached to it successfully.  You might try dmesg or lspci to look for your sound card.
[00:17] <Fryguy--> ariqs: it will only get removed if you use purge
[00:17] <satan_> any idea why the frequency on my cores scales down by itself, even though i'm using the userspace governor
[00:17] <satan_> could it be overheating? my laptop is super hot
[00:17] <ariqs> k
[00:17] <Fryguy--> satan_: you probably have scaling enabled in your bios
[00:17] <Fryguy--> most modern laptops have it enabled by default to save power and prevent overheating
[00:17] <satan_> Fryguy--: i thought i had to have that enabled?
[00:17] <satan_> oh
[00:17] <tqc> i removed totem-gstreamer, one guy said to me it could help, but nothing happend
[00:17] <rizkhan> my laptop gets too hot when using ubuntu .. its not that hot in windows .. n i cant get the sensors too work
[00:18] <ali_> any1 use bluefish here?
[00:18] <satan_> Fryguy--: so you mean it can do power management without bios support for it?
[00:18] <tqc> strange thing is that i have thumbnails of movies in normal coloures

[00:19] <ali_> like in dreamwaver
[00:19] <ALPSINC> hello all
[00:19] <Storrgie> Fryguy--: i dunno how to configute oss to do digital out

[00:19] <ALPSINC> how can I get rid of the "mail status" when I log in to my ssh
[00:19] <rizkhan> ali_: there is no preview pane .. ull have to view it using html
[00:19] <Fryguy--> Storrgie: use alsa or pulseaudio instead
[00:19] <ALPSINC> it's rathor annoying >.>
[00:20] <shingalated> Fryguy: Still not working, was I just supposed to add "NameVirtualHost 192.168.0.138 " to the virtual hosts?

[00:20] <rizkhan> ali_: using any browser
[00:20] <Eric7> checking for GTK... no configure: error: Couldn't find a suitable Gtk version. You need at least version 2.8.0 i know ive asked things like this but what type of gtk is it talking about O.o?
[00:20] <Fryguy--> ALPSINC: check to see if it's in your .bash_profile or .bashrc
[00:20] <ali_> o
[00:20] <ali_> thats doesn't work for me either
[00:20] <Storrgie> Fryguy--: but OSS supports my XFi card
[00:20] <Storrgie> grr
[00:20] <Fryguy--> shingalated: to one of them, yes
[00:20] <ALPSINC> Fryguy--: will check
[00:20] <ali_> i clicked view in borwser and nothign happens
[00:20] <shingalated> when I restart apache it says: [Thu Jul 03 19:18:37 2008] [warn] VirtualHost site1.info:0 overlaps with VirtualHost site2.info:0, the first has precedence, perhaps you need a NameVirtualHost directive
[00:20] <imaginator> Eric7: you need a gtk dev package most likely
[00:20] <Eric7> what kind?
[00:20] <mistergibson> anyone know how to *properly* do network bridging ... urls welcome
[00:20] <rizkhan> ali_: what do u mean, no code ?
[00:20] <Fryguy--> Eric7: libgtk-2.0-dev
[00:20] <shingalated> yeah I only added it to site1
[00:20] <ali_> no nothing happens
[00:20] <guillaume> imaginator: I got Intel HD

[00:22] <guillaume> well, it's stange but it works now
[00:22] <Fryguy--> shingalated: yes

[00:23] <ALPSINC> Fryguy--: nor in the system wide ones
[00:23] <AMLNXUSR> "<Fryguy--> AMLNXUSR: a tar.bz2 file is a compressed tarball, you use tar -xjf to d"  FryGuy once i decommpress do i still need a compiler to install the app?
[00:23] <shingalated> fryguy: I only had it on one.
[00:23] <Fryguy--> ALPSINC: dunno where it checks then, sorry
[00:23] <graft> are there any well-documented free mp3 decoding libraries (besides libmad0)?
[00:23] <ALPSINC> np
[00:23] <joshual> anyone know if its possible to get jack working on a default ubuntu install?
[00:23] <Fryguy--> AMLNXUSR: depends what's in the tarball lol
[00:23] <rizkhan> ali_: add it to browsers using edit preferences
[00:24] <Fryguy--> AMLNXUSR: and why aren't you just using the ubuntu repositories
[00:24] <ali_> k lemme try
[00:24] <imaginator> guillaume: ok, so we're one step further.  It sees the device.  Obviously it attached too.  That's strange.  Any clue as to why it wasn't working before?
[00:24] <AMLNXUSR> its alsa for my sound drivers
[00:24] <ali_> what tab can i fidn that in
[00:24] <Fryguy--> AMLNXUSR: and what makes you think you need to install a new version of alsa ?
[00:24] <ALPSINC> does anyone else know how to get rid of the mail status when you login?
[00:24] <guillaume> It was on autodetec
[00:24] <AMLNXUSR> cuz i cant get my sound to work
[00:24] <scsi2> Hi guys. Anybody know if I can burn a CD in Ubuntu Live? Can I just take the Live CD out?
[00:24] <Tux2K8> did anyone here successfully upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04???
[00:25] <imaginator> Tux2K8: yes.  I upgraded recently.
[00:25] <wgato> imaginator:  i've looked through dmesg and dont see any mention of sda.  and its not in Computer - File Browser either
[00:25] <Fryguy--> AMLNXUSR: upgrading alsa almost certainly isn't going to help that
[00:25] <xhuangzi> Hm... can you burn CD's with a live CD?
[00:25] <guillaume> I changed for the right one
[00:25] <ph8> i'm looking for a really basic, secure http server to run on a non-standard port and just support PHP - do i need to install full apache?
[00:25] <xhuangzi> Doesn't seem like you could.
[00:25] <AMLNXUSR> so what will?
[00:25] <Fryguy--> ph8: apache, lighthttpd, and nginx are popular choices
[00:25] <AMLNXUSR> iv tried everything i can think of
[00:25] <Fryguy--> AMLNXUSR: well what specifically is the problem, and what have you done to resolve it?
[00:25] <imaginator> wgato: I'm not sure if sata shows up as scsi/sda.  I don't have any sata devices.  are there any disks detected?
[00:25] <ali_> wat r some other webdevelopment prgrams for ubuntu
[00:26] <guillaume> AMLNXUSR
[00:26] <supertanker> Hah

[00:26] <guillaume> it's working now
[00:26] <supertanker> I'm trying to fit Xubuntu on a 1GB Flash Drive
[00:26] <Fryguy--> ali_: any reasonable text editor will do a fine job.  I recommend vim for development purposes
[00:26] <PossibleBit> ali_: use gedit, it should have html highlighting.
[00:26] <AMLNXUSR> well like i said no sound .. i played around with the mixer and sound options .. and checked out forums that had some good tips but nothing worked for me
[00:26] <Fryguy--> AMLNXUSR: what sound card do you ahve
[00:26] <ali_> alrite but nay really good and fancy ones liek drweamweaver
[00:27] <AMLNXUSR> soundblasters audigy
[00:27] <Fryguy--> ali_: dreamweaver is awful as an html editor
[00:27] <Fryguy--> AMLNXUSR: which model?
[00:27] <ali_> no!
[00:27] <Fryguy--> audigy? audigy2? audigy4?
[00:27] <ALPSINC> anyone else?
[00:27] <guillaume> AMLNXUSR: did u test the card in system/preference/sound <?^
[00:27] <ali_> well...yea
