[20:34] <linuxbitch> hey
[20:35] <kostkon> gotwig, why?
[20:35] <greek> Hi guys how do I COMPLETELY disable the touchpad in 12.04 LTS?
[20:35] <bekks> greek: Best chances are to do so in the BIOS.
[20:35] <apb1963> so the question then becomes not why does zoiper not work, but why does zoiper not work for my specific instance of ubuntu 12.04 with kde ?
[20:35] <apb1963> t38:  What desktop are you using?
[20:35] <IdleOne> dahkmattah231: you there?
[20:35] <gotwig> kostkon: because I was a unity dev, time ago, and I want to see something new. All unity < 8 is not interessting to me
[20:36] <joaouser> helo
[20:36] <kostkon> gotwig, ok
[20:36] <greek> kostkon is basically my name haha
[20:36] <gotwig> kostkon: we all want to see something new, dont we
[20:36] <greek> bekks, ok thanks
[20:36] <gotwig> but for LTS they want to have something stable, yeah..

[20:38] <bekks> sam_uk: Pastebin the full output...
[20:38] <IdleOne> dahkmattah231: now?
[20:39] <apb1963> t38: so what that says to me is that there's something wrong with kde.....  how do I install cinnamon (I don't why but I want to call it cinnabun :) )
[20:39] <dahkmattah231> ufw with its default configuration, does it basically blocks all incoming connections except the ones you allow?
[20:39] <bekks> dahkmattah231: Thats the default configuration, yes.
[20:40] <NetCatty_> How do I set the priority for media player to use the media keys and how to switch between them?
[20:40] <dahkmattah231> thanks bekks
[20:41] <boern> how can i hide the join and quid messages i xchat? they are so annoying
[20:41] <boern> quit*
[20:42] <t38> apb1963:  http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/1246  need to add the repository
[20:42] <dahkmattah231> boern: settings->preferences->(chatting)General.. and there it is
[20:42] <sam_uk> bekks, http://pastebin.com/NkZfSAfX
[20:42] <bekks> sam_uk: Then pastebin your grub configuration please.
[20:43] <sam_uk> /etc/grub ?
[20:43] <bekks> sam_uk: yes, there it is.
[20:44] <apb1963> t38: thanks.  However, it just occurred to me.... what version of ubuntu are you running?
[20:44] <shhha> hey dual booting question, if i use gparted to make a partition and on this partition i want to install windows 7, is the only format "NTFS"?  and no other that would work ?
[20:44] <bekks> shhha: Correct.
[20:44] <k1l> shhha: yes.
[20:45] <paulus68> shhha: you should probably install windows first and then ubuntu
[20:45] <NetCatty_> windows 7 is still using ntfs?
[20:46] <bekks> NetCatty_: Yes.
[20:46] <bekks> NetCatty_: Even Win 8.1 does.
[20:46] <shhha> paulus68: interesting... is this because if i install ubuntu overall and tick the "LVM and encrypted file" stuff and THEN installed windows it wouldn't work too well?
[20:46] <jmgk> hi shhha
[20:46] <sam_uk> bekks, weird i don't have a /etc/grub i have a /etc/grub.d folder with subfolders in it..
[20:46] <NetCatty_> bekks: didn't they upgraded it to somthing or anther?
[20:46] <bekks> sam_uk: yeah.
[20:46] <therazr> NetCatty_: And they don't know then ReFS will be ready
[20:46] <shhha> jmgk: hi
[20:47] <bekks> NetCatty_: No.
[20:47] <bekks> shhha: No. Generally, Windows messes up the bootloader.
[20:47] <paulus68> shhha: the thing is when you are going to do a dual boot you first need to install windows because it can be messing arround with your bootloader
[20:48] <sam_uk> bekks, I _should_ have a /etc/grub file? right?
[20:48] <bekks> sam_uk: No.
[20:48] <t38> apb1963: I'm running 13.04
[20:48] <sam_uk> no?
[20:48] <bekks> sam_uk: No.
[20:48] <paulus68> shhha: http://lifehacker.com/5403100/dual+boot-windows-7-and-ubuntu-in-perfect-harmony
[20:48] <bekks> sam_uk: /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/
[20:48] <ashish2> hi
[20:49] <apb1963> t38: that would make the difference... all kinds of stuff works in 13.04 that doesn't in 12.04
[20:49] <shhha> bekks: aw man.. lol.  now i may just make the entire switch to ubuntu then...   lol paulus68  so is there no way to have a "good" dual boot setup with ubuntu and win7 where the ubuntu half has the LVM and encrypted file feature, are these features worth it also?
[20:49] <ice9> in Uhuntu 13.10 sound there is always background noise when playing any sound!
[20:50] <sam_uk> bekks, http://pastebin.com/vubNE5LA
[20:50] <paulus68> shhha:yes but you need to install windows first and then ubuntu
[20:51] <paulus68> shhha: just follow the guide I mentioned earlier
[20:51] <Jordan_U> shhha: You can have your Ubuntu partitions however you like them, and to be clear it is possible to install Windows second, it just means that you'll have to manually re-install grub after Windows clobbers it.
[20:51] <t38> apb1963:   Worth a shot..  You might like the way cinnamon works. Its kinda 'purty'
[20:52] <sam_uk> bekks, /etc/default/grub : http://pastebin.com/UDb3g7Vb
[20:52] <Jordan_U> sam_uk: Please pastebin your /etc/default/grub .
[20:52] <johnjohn101>   /join #couchdb
[20:53] <master_j> how does this look? http://i.imgur.com/RADFPoQ.png
[20:53] <paulus68> Jordan_U: it's possible to word this way but it's more adviceable to install windows first then Ubuntu this has been the most clean way since a long way back
[20:53] <shhha> paulus68: Jordan_U  hmm thanks, i didn't know that, but that makes sense now.
[20:53] <paulo> 2
[20:53] <paulo> a
[20:53] <paulus68> Work
[20:53] <apb1963> t38 I've heard good things about it... but then I've heard good things about lots of stuff... my biggest fear is that I install it and then get stuck with something that doesn't work... I can't seem do find a support channel for it, other than linux-mint
[20:53] <sam_uk> Jordan_U, Just spotted original/ edited lines & re-edited.
[20:54] <bekks> sam_uk: line 17/18 are messed up.
[20:55] <paulus68> shhha: it's always better to start with windows first because if you work the other way arround your boatloader gets messed up
[20:55] <apb1963> t38: and I certainly don't want to upgrade to 13.04... for one thing it's not LTS I don't think, and for another I hear too many stories about people needing to totally reinstall to get it working.  I can't afford to mess up this machine and don't have another to work with.
[20:55] <t38> apb1963:  The good thing about DE's is - you can always switch back. Just choose the one you want at login
[20:55] <bekks> sam_uk: USe this line for 17/18: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="splash quiet i915.i915_enable_fbc=1 pcie_aspm=force acpi_backlight=vendor"
[20:55] <sam_uk> bekks, yep just saw that, commented it out now updating
[20:55] <fahadash> My first month as a ubuntu user is over and now ubuntu is acting like windows.
[20:56] <apb1963> t38: I reboot and/or login so little I forget you can change desktops

[20:56] <fahadash> I hit the start button to open that full-screen covering programs menu (or whatever it is called)... I am clicking options, it closes the menu but never launches that application why ?

=== Brandon is now known as Guest54804
[20:57] <t38> japb1963: just log out -> choose your preferred desktop -> log back in
[20:57] <apb1963> t38: for me, logging out is nearly the same as rebooting.... I hate doing it because I always have a boatload of windows open that I hate to reset... although these days with browswers continuing from where they left off, it's not as bad as it used to be.
[20:59] <t38> apb1963: I can understand that. I rebooted mine last night for the first time in about 2 weeks
[20:59] <sam_uk> bekks, that looks happier.. Thanks
[20:59] <Guest54804> Hey all. Does anyone know if, when  using an interactive shell program, it is possible to return to and edit a previously entered line if the command has not yet been terminated?
[21:00] <bekks> Guest54804: Yes, I know it. No it isnt possible.
=== Guest54804 is now known as BrandonM
[21:00] <apb1963> t38: well, getting a softphone working is more important than anything else right now, so I'll go install cinnabun... thank you
[21:00] <BrandonM> OK, thanks a lot, bekks.
[21:02] <t38> apb1963:  Had someone tell me one time about a cinnabun, "try it, you'll like it" - hard to stop after just one. LOL
[21:09] <apb1963> t38: I've never actually tried one... cinnamon rolls, yes... cinnabun... no.  But I can't get the name out of my head.... very....umm... sticky.
=== sburjan_ is now known as sburjan`
[21:09] <apb1963> is anyone else here running cinnamon?  Just in case I need... you know... support

[21:10] <okay19> How much swap should I use on a new install with 6 gb of ram?
[21:10] <OerHeks> okay19, let the installer decide, if you want hybernate/sleep
[21:10] <apb1963> t38: So I guess it's all installed now... just logout and back in again then huh?
[21:11] <therazr> okay19: Just tell how much space you want to give to Ubuntu, and the installer will decide on the swap space
[21:11] <k1l> okay19: if you want suspend2disk: swap=ram
[21:12] <t38> apb1963: There's always the #linuxmint group IF there are any gotchas
[21:13] <apb1963> t38: how interesting...  zoiper works now... and I didn't even need to run the cinnabun desktop... just install it.

[21:14] <andybrine> Evening everyont
[21:14] <andybrine> everyone
[21:14] <Othi`> hello, i'm having an issue with some upstart scripts. it tells me 'setuid: not found'. other scripts calling setuid work
[21:14] <apb1963> apb1963: yeah, I noticed some stuff come down with the cinnabun files, which is what made me think to try zoiper again.
[21:14] <Othi`> google has nothing on it
[21:14] <apb1963> oh look i'm talking to myself
[21:14] <wiak> do anyone got a clue why ubuntu will reboot it self when i run x264 encoding?
[21:15] <t38> apb1963: NOW, will it place a call????
[21:15] <andybrine> Has anyone had this issue with 13.10? It is showing a black background and i am unable to change it
[21:15] <apb1963> t38: yeah, I noticed some stuff come down with the cinnabun files, which is what made me think to try zoiper again.
[21:15] <wiak> no problem with cpu temp, its around ~40c
[21:15] <bekks> wiak: Thermal protection of the hardware, CPU overheating protection, e.g.
[21:15] <apb1963> t38: that's my next test...
[21:16] <wiak> i have a A10-5800K, Noctua cooler, so no problem with temp i belive
[21:17] <apb1963> t38: when I try to add an account I get "can't open file '/zoiper.sh' (error 13: Permission denied)"  --- which also happened on startup but I ignored it
[21:17] <apb1963> "Failed to create startup entry"
[21:18] <andybrine> Im sooo dissapointed with the 13.10 release
[21:18] <andybrine> I have had nothing but problems since installing it
[21:19] <andybrine> has anyone else had problems with no wallpaper in 13.10?
[21:19] <bekks> !anyone | andybrine
[21:19] <ubottu> andybrine: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[21:20] <miggol> Hey, I just upgraded to 13.10 from 13.04 on an optimus laptop. This broke my xorg (bumblebee/primus) setup, so I purged those packages and have installed nvidia-prime. I am now only able to login to Gnome Flashback no-effects, both kde and unity fail to load their respective window managers.
[21:20] <andybrine> the wallpaper is there when first installed but after a reboot i just get a black wallpaper
[21:21] <k1l> andybrine: did you set another picture as wallpaper to try it out?
[21:21] <k1l> andybrine: what does .xsession-errors say?
[21:21] <miggol> Strangely in flashback glxinfo shows all the right extensions and nvidia-settings says all is fine, though under my display states it has no scanout. How can I troubleshoot this problem?
[21:21] <andybrine> I have set another wallpaper but it wont change
[21:22] <apb1963> t38: sigh... zoiper is frozen on "failed to create startup entry"
[21:22] <l01> Can I use a 64bit Live CD to chroot into a 32bit? (both are Ubuntu)
[21:22] <bekks> l01: Yes.
[21:22] <l01> Are there any downsides?
[21:22] <bekks> l01: No.
[21:22] <l01> like incompatibilities and such?
[21:22] <Jordan_U> l01: Nope. It's only the other way around where there are issues.
[21:22] <l01> okay, thank you =)
[21:22] <wilee-nilee> andybrine, You might try a reset http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/08/reset-unity-and-compiz-in-ubuntu-13-10/
[21:23] <miggol> Should I check .xsession-errors after logging into unity? It seems fine from flashback
[21:23] <apb1963> t38: I told it to start at startup... so I imagine it's trying to put install into /etc/rc.d or some such... which of course it can't since i'm not root.  silly zoiper
[21:23] <miggol> Just some gnome-settings-daemon whining
[21:23] <Diren>  Selamlar.
[21:23] <andybrine> ok thanks wilee-nilee
[21:24] <_Bauer> Guys, when I report a problem/crash, or right click on  /var/crash/some.file and report it, the apport is not opening the bug report for me to track - is that normal? how do I fix this behaviour?
[21:24] <apb1963> t38: oh look... a kill and a restart and now it registers...
[21:25] <r3dfish> has anyone printed any of the 3d printable cases for their udoo yet, I found a couple on thingiverse
[21:25] <t38> apb1963: Interesting.  I would probably just start it with a script of my own.. Are you running the full version?
[21:25] <andybrine> I still have no wallpaper

[21:39] <Dr_willis> alex_,  and how do we know what the last command was....
[21:39] <alex_> @ubottu Im running Ubuntu 13.10 and installing it to my macbook with a usb stick, ive followed the supplied tutorial exactly and am at the last step: (Execute  sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/diskN bs=1m)     So far its been about 15 mins and no response from terminal except if i would try to close it says it will terminate the running proccess dd sudo
[21:40] <Dr_willis> a dd command can take quite a bit of time to work.
[21:40] <Dr_willis> there will be no response untill its done
[21:41] <alex_> thank you DR Willis, appreciate it
[21:41] <Dr_willis> !tab
[21:41] <ubottu> You can use your <tab> key for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[21:41] <bekks> alex_: How big is the /path/to/downloaded.img ?
[21:41] <Dr_willis> i do hope he used the actual path to the img. :)

[21:41] <Ben64> alex_: open a second terminal, and type "sudo killall -SIGUSR1 dd"
[21:41] <alex_> thanks for the help all! it just finished *facepalm* so im gonna go do this and feel stupid bye
[21:41] <bitplane> Would this suggest a problem with gobject-introspection package / package name or an autoconf bug?
[21:41] <apb1963> Dr_willis: And the right disk
[21:41] <apb1963> device
[21:42] <trism> bitplane: you might need libgirepository1.0-dev
[21:43] <bitplane> thanks trism!
[21:43] <Dr_willis> bitplane,  if a program is int he repos.. you can use 'sudo apt-get build-dep  packagename' that will pull in all needed dependencies to compile the app. (might be build-deps)
[21:44] <bitplane> Dr_willis, I did that but I'm checking to see if the bug in Ubuntu is also upstream, so I'm compiling git head from gnome.org

[21:45] <Dr_willis> sounds like its saying  it wont run in your current os version rawrmonster ...
[21:45] <bekks> rawrmonster: Ask the vendor. They do know why they are telling you it isnt available for your version.

[21:56] <andreex> hi there. I installed Ubutnu 13 from mini.iso but it's not working. When it reaches the point when it would ask for a password it keeps alternating between a pink screen and a blank one. so until I find a way to fix it I want to boot from the second disk, which has Ubunto 12 LTS. As the GRUB splash screen has both systems listed I want to change the default boot disk for the moment. I've looked in the Internet, bu most sites mention file /boot/menu.lst..
[21:56] <andreex> . unfortunately I don't have this file in /boot. any hint on how to change the default boot disk on this Ubuntu machine?

[22:05] <oliver_> hello, i have a big problem, whenever i suspend, my screen wont turn on after a suspend, this happend after i upgraded to 13.10, had a lot of issues with 13.10 so downgraded to 12.04, but now my suspend doesn't work here too, it did before
[22:06] <alex______> Ok I'm back, with some more questions. I have installed Ubuntu 13.10 onto my USB stick to be used on my mac. i finished the whole tutorial process and restarted my mac and opened ubuntu from my usb stick. Now it seems Ubuntu is opening and operational, but it opens the ubuntu install client and wants me to erase and replace my mac osx with ubuntu...i dont want to do that, if at all possible id like to use ubuntu from my usb stic
[22:06] <wiak> https://github.com/groeck/nct6775/ <- trying to compile that
[22:06] <alex______> to ubuntu
[22:08] <OerHeks> user239823, i can't find a good solution for duplicity.
[22:09] <user239823> OerHeks: Ok, thanks for your time anyway. Regards.
[22:09] <oliver_> alex______: you can see about using ubuntu on usb without installing here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/try-ubuntu-before-you-install
[22:10] <sha1sum> so many underscores.
[22:10] <wiak> make: *** /usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-31-generic: No such file or directory. Stop.
[22:10] <wiak> :/
[22:11] <wiak> E: Package 'linux-headers-3.8.0-31-generic' has no installation candidate
[22:11] <wiak> erm
[22:11] <sha1sum> wiak: you probably need linux-headers package
[22:11] <sha1sum> oh wait
[22:11] <sha1sum> nevermind
[22:12] <sha1sum> I suppose that's the issue.
[22:12] <wiak> the module tells me it needs 3.8.0.31 but the system only got 3.11.0-12 and 3.5.0-39
[22:12] <ampw> is there a chromium ppa?
[22:12] <alex______> <sha1sum> can i run ubuntu applications that i have on cd or dvd while in the "try" mode?
[22:13] <Ubnoobtu> Hey All, I'm back again with some new issues which I think are entirely from me not being thorough enough.
[22:13] <wiak> meybe i should boot into 3.5 :P
[22:13] <wiak> and try again
[22:14] <sha1sum> wiak: probably won't solve the fact that it looks like it's wanting a specific kernel version, which seems creepy to me
[22:14] <erpo> My Ubuntu 12.04 box is stopping at an (initramfs) prompt when I try to boot it up.  I booted from a system rescue USB flash drive and ran fsck on my root filesystem, and it indicated that it replayed the journal. However, this did not solve the problem. Suggestions?
[22:16] <wiak> sha1sum 3.8.0-31-generic is the current running kernel, but the headers are MIA
[22:16] <oliver_> ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, 13.10, iam not able to use suspend function, it just gives me a black screen when i start up after suspend
[22:17] <sha1sum> wiak: did you build your kernel from source by any chance?
[22:18] <sha1sum> wiak: either way, is there any way you can install both the kernel and headers from the same version and boot to it?
[22:19] <wilee-nilee> erpo, Is this with kernel choice at grub?
[22:19] <wilee-nilee> every*
[22:19] <bcgrown> I upgraded to Xubuntu 13.10 and now I can't play multiple audio streams at once.  I could on 12.10 before I upgraded.  How do I make it work again?
[22:20] <erpo> wilee-nilee: This is after GRUB chooses a kernel by itself and boots it.
[22:20] <sha1sum> erpo: can you choose a different one and boot to it?

[22:52] <javanic> hitsujiTMO, how do i go about doing all that?
[22:52] <Die_Nadal> This means that my home directory is encrypted right ? (.Private -> /home/.ecryptfs/user/.Private)
[22:53] <Die_Nadal> or just .Private ?
[22:54] <javanic> hitsujiTMO,  when i try the apt-get clean it asks me for the password, then doesn't do anything.. i don't get it lol

[23:07] <Dr_Willis> more '/boot is full how to i clean it out' questions? ;)
[23:08] <Dr_Willis> okay19:  chat in the channel. most of us ignore pm's
[23:08] <okay19> Ok
[23:08] <Dr_Willis> okay19:  and from that ive read of the efi install wiki page  you mount that partion to /boot/efi or somthing like that.
[23:08] <Dr_Willis> !uefi
[23:08] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[23:09] <hitsujiTMO> parduse: either should be just as good
[23:09] <javanic> hitsujiTMO, running it now
[23:09] <okay19> Dr_Willis: I saw that, but the partition's type is labeled "EFI boot partition" in the list and there is no option to set the mount point.
[23:09] <parduse> ty Dr_Willis & hitsujiTMO
[23:09] <okay19> Dr_Willis: So do I just leave it and install?
[23:09] <erpo> If anyone else is having the same problem, the solution was to add the kernel option bootdegraded=yes in GRUB. Apparently one of my disks was dying in a way that *didn't* show up in /proc/mdstat even after running a check.
[23:10] <Dr_Willis> okay19:  no idea then. I have never used a uefi system.  from what i recall reading its a fat32 partion and mounted to /boot/uefi
[23:10] <okay19> Ah, ok.
[23:10] <hitsujiTMO> okay19: what exactly are you trying to do?
[23:10] <Dr_Willis> okay19:  go for it. ;)
[23:10] <Dr_Willis> install to a uefi system . using custome partioning.
[23:11] <javanic> hitsujiTMO, ok.. it's done. do i need to check anything to make sure it's done what it needs to? or should it be assumed that all is good now?
[23:12] <hitsujiTMO> okay19: yeah, if you want to reformat the efi partition, it must be marked as ef00 (with gdisk or cgdisk) and you mount that to /boot/efi as dr_willis said
[23:12] <Anonynimity> how would I find out the computer names connected to my network and their ip addresses via terminal?

[23:13] <Anonynimity> I don't know what that is parduse...
[23:13] <k1l> Die_Nadal: its encryptfs encrypted home. you did choose that on install
[23:13] <Anonynimity> I'm looking for other device names connected to the network with their ip addresses.

[23:14] <jcrza> So I found a step-by-step page to install a PXE server that enables you to pick from multiple distros on the client computer, but is there something that makes it a bit easier?
[23:14] <hitsujiTMO> javanic: sweet, you've a crapton of space in /boot again. remember to clean it out after every few dist-upgrades
[23:14] <javanic> hitsujiTMO, by just using the "autoremove"?
[23:15] <jcrza> Oop, answered my own question. ERPXE looks like what I need
[23:16] <hitsujiTMO> javanic: by looking at what your current kernel is with: uname -r      and remove any kernels you see that are older than that listed as installed in: dpkg --get-selections | grep linux-image
[23:17] <javanic> hitsujiTMO, ok, so use the same "apt-get purge" with whatever isn't the current kernel?
[23:18] <hitsujiTMO> javanic: not whatever isn't just whatever is older than the kernel .. you dont want to purge newer kernels
[23:18] <okay19> Does the installer set the EFI boot partition's mount point automatically?
[23:18] <hitsujiTMO> okay19: yes it does if you let ubuntu do the partitioning
[23:19] <okay19> hitsujiTMO: What if you do it yourself, or 'something else'?
[23:19] <javanic> hitsujiTMO, ok cool. thanks for the help! how do i learn how to do all this myself? is there any good resources that i can read up on?
[23:20] <hitsujiTMO> okay19: what you can do is let ubuntu do it, then go back and edit what it does
[23:20] <hitsujiTMO> javanic: google is the best resource to be honest. wel for me anyway
[23:20] <okay19> hitsujiTMO: The problem is that the installer isn't detecting windows 8 and I'm trying a dual boot here
[23:21] <javanic> hitsujiTMO, ok, thanks again.. much appreciated! :)
[23:24] <Die_Nadal> k1l yes I thought I had but wanted to know if it worked, or at least how to confirm it.
[23:28] <hitsujiTMO> okay19: its almost impossible for the installer not to pick up windows since it just needs to see the efi boot manager to see what operating systems you've installed. have you made room for the ubuntu install manually?

[23:46] <bibi346> hi, in web-development, instead of sending an email when the user is waiting for the http response, some people delegate this task to some backend worker, so taht the response can be sent asap, do you know how it is called? Is there a name for this programming technique?
[23:46] <hitsujiTMO> prx: try a reboot, have you actually used that proxy before?

[23:58] <prx> whats that?

[00:05] <hitsujiTMO> prx: i searched http_proxy and the ip, normally if it was some sort of malware, someone would have written about it somewhere
[00:06] <prx> or he just had a huge list of them proxies
[00:06] <prx> any other ways to see if i was infected?

[00:43] <mIKEjONES> hello, I recently tried to install ia32-libs-multiarch on 13.04
[00:43] <mIKEjONES> and my entire system is hosed, X will no longer start
[00:45] <mIKEjONES> and if I try to apt-get remove anything it says "dpkg error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/libsane_1.0.23-0ubuntu1_i386.dev: (unpack)"
[00:45] <mIKEjONES> "trying to overwrite shared 'etc/sane.d/dc240.conf'
[00:46] <Anonynimity> could someone please point me to a fix for this?
[00:46] <Anonynimity> hello. I just upgraded from ubuntu 13.04 to ubuntu 13.10 and I have no launcher or gnome-indicator.
[00:47] <mIKEjONES> how come I can't use apt-get install?
[00:47] <mIKEjONES> everytime I try to install something it complains about some package that failed to install
[00:48] <Ben64> mIKEjONES: sounds like you broke stuff
[00:48] <mIKEjONES> no, it broke itself
[00:48] <mIKEjONES> I tried to apt-get install ia32-libs as I have in the past
[00:48] <Ben64> that doesn't really happen
[00:48] <mIKEjONES> except 13.X is broken
[00:48] <garcianc> mIKEjONES, can you sudo apt-get update?
[00:48] <mIKEjONES> garcianc: yea that work
[00:49] <mIKEjONES> works*
[00:50] <hitsujiTMO> mIKEjONES: try: sudo apt-get clean
[00:51] <mIKEjONES> it works for 5 seconds
[00:51] <mIKEjONES> but then it tries to install some other package that broke a while ago
[00:51] <mIKEjONES> so I'm trying to apt-get install irssi
[00:51] <mIKEjONES> but it's complainigna about libsane:i386 being a dependency to ia32-libs-multiarch
[00:52] <Ben64> pastebin "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get upgrade"
[00:52] <wilee-nilee> mIKEjONES, Do you have broken packages?
[00:53] <mIKEjONES> wilee-nilee: I tried to install ia32-libs as I have in the past
[00:53] <mIKEjONES> but apparently it's insanely broken on 13.0X
[00:53] <genii> ia32 libs does not exist anymore since multiarch support
[00:53] <Ben64> ia32-libs has been ditched in favor of multiarch

[00:55] <mIKEjONES> http://pastebin.com/kr7YB0Wv
[00:55] <Ben64> thats not what i said : /
[00:55] <mIKEjONES> oh
[00:55] <hitsujiTMO> mIKEjONES: do what it tells you to do: sudo apt-get -f install
[00:56] <Ben64> mIKEjONES: and using root like that is not recommended
[00:57] <mIKEjONES> Ben64: sudo times out kind of weird, I won't like prepending sudo in front of commands when I have to do sysadmining
[00:57] <mIKEjONES> I'm sure there is no difference between apt-get running as root or being sudo'd to run as root
[00:57] <mIKEjONES> http://pastebin.com/TqmuC3kB
[00:57] <mIKEjONES> ^ apt-get update
[00:57] <Ben64> well its more dangerous to be doing stuff as root all the time
[00:58] <dogslob> Installed ubuntu, grub failed.  I get a blank screen with a cursor.  Help?
[00:58] <Dr_Willis> !nomodeset
[00:58] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[00:58] <mIKEjONES> well when I have to run apt-get and edit different files in /, I feel like running as root is recommended
[00:58] <Dr_Willis> that may or may not be a grub failure. grub is hidden by default if ubuntu is the only os installed
[00:58] <mIKEjONES> not quite sure what alternatives you would suggest
[00:59] <mIKEjONES> maybe chmodding -R 777 / ?
[00:59] <Ben64> sudo. its very easy to use
[00:59] <mIKEjONES> yea it is
[00:59] <Dr_Willis> mIKEjONES:  you may as well do a reinstall if you are trying stuff like that.
[00:59] <mIKEjONES> sudo -s is even simpler
[00:59] <genii> Recommended is sudo -i    and exit after.
[00:59] <Ben64> genii: no, you almost never need a root shell
[00:59] <hitsujiTMO> mIKEjONES: have you run: sudo apt-get -f install
[01:00] <dogslob> Can you install Ubuntu without Grub?
[01:00] <Dr_Willis> dogslob:  you could install it.. but how would you boot it.
[01:00] <Dr_Willis> !fixgrub | dogslob
[01:00] <ubottu> dogslob: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2

[01:02] <dogslob> What are the issues with a uefi?
[01:02] <hitsujiTMO> mIKEjONES: are you using a conflicting ppa?
[01:02] <mIKEjONES> no
[01:02] <garcianc> on the sudo issue, you can try an experiment and sudo vi <some filename>, then save it. Then check the owner of the file.
[01:02] <mIKEjONES> this is all vanilla raring
[01:03] <zipper> I ran: apt-cache search ^ruby$ and got output as `ruby` and `ruby1.8`

[01:03] <zipper> How can I reinstall ruby?
[01:03] <SuperLag> mIKEjONES: I'd almost try moving that /etc/sane.d/dc240.conf file an try the operation again.
[01:03] <genii> hitsujiTMO: Since they were able to start the install of ia32-libs and it's not in 13.10, then it's coming from somewhere.
[01:03] <SuperLag> wilee-nilee: hitsujiTMO: what do you guys think of my suggestion? ^^^
[01:03] <hitsujiTMO> zipper: sudo apt-get install --reinstall
[01:03] <mIKEjONES> SuperLag: is there any way to just canel this package from being installed
[01:04] <mIKEjONES> apt seems hellbent on installing this package
[01:04] <mIKEjONES> like there is no way I make it forget it about it and remove it
[01:04] <SuperLag> mIKEjONES: something you requested for install has it as a dependency, so no.
[01:04] <mIKEjONES> any invocation of apt now turns into it wanting to install random packages
[01:04] <genii> Ah, 13.04, not 13.10, nvm then.
[01:04] <mIKEjONES> SuperLag: seriosuly?
[01:05] <mIKEjONES> there is no way to remove the package that wants to install this depedency?
[01:05] <mIKEjONES> until the dependency is installed?
[01:05] <SuperLag> mIKEjONES: but do you know which package it was that required sane in the first place?
[01:05] <hitsujiTMO> mIKEjONES: i would go with superlags suggestion and rename the conflicting .conf

[01:14] <msdw> any ppa in mind???/
[01:14] <hitsujiTMO> msdw: running apache httpd is not a straight forward process, you need to set configurations, in 2.4s case theres a number of environment vars that must be set. a ppa should have a basic config for you.
[01:14] <msdw> ok
[01:14] <hitsujiTMO> msdw: is there a particular reason why you need 2.4?
[01:15] <msdw> ive heard about a ddos issue on 2.2 that there no patch for
[01:16] <hitsujiTMO> msdw: that sounds unlikely, do you have a link to the article?

[02:00] <brli> hi, anyone have experience with firefox globalmenu working with kde?
[02:00] <Dr_Willis> unity can get picky sadly with the 3d drivers. :(  not seen any really details of why 3d drivers are working. but unity dont run (well its compiz thts not running)
[02:01] <Ari-Yang> Dr_Willis: "3D drivers" == fglrx?
=== shengyao_afk is now known as shengyao
[02:03] <Dr_Willis> Ari-Yang:  or nvidia for nvidia cards
[02:03] <Dr_Willis> then theres the open sourced drivers that can provide 3d for some cards
[02:03] <Ari-Yang> Dr_Willis: but were you referring to fglrx when in previous statement?
[02:03] <Dr_Willis> ive even seen the built in intel drivers hve issues.
=== MobGod_ is now known as MobGod
[02:04] <exco> Dr_Willis, might be a problem here ... 5 nvidia nvs440 in my box ...
[02:04] <Ari-Yang> because fglrx is garbage compared to open source radeon
[02:04] <Dr_Willis> Ari-Yang:  i dont use fglrx :)  i got 1 ati system.

[02:06] <smuxi> let's see
[02:06] <hitsujiTMO> smuxi: have you ensured that they are both indeed on the same vmnet and that vmwares dhcp server is disabled?
[02:06] <NCS_One> hitsujiTMO: a few times
[02:06] <smuxi> hitsujiTMO: they are both in the same vmnet, but vmware dhcp server is enabled
[02:06] <Dr_Willis> gabriel:  see what delicious.com has bookmarked/tagged the most for linux tutorials also. ;)
[02:07] <smuxi> hitsujiTMO: it is enabled because it worked fine yesterday in this way
[02:07] <hitsujiTMO> NCS_One: what graphics chipset are you using?
[02:07] <smuxi> hitsujiTMO: I only needed to put the interface down, restart the dhcp server and put the interface back to up state
[02:08] <smuxi> today is a different response, tho
[02:08] <hitsujiTMO> smuxi: wait, did you not say that you were using an ubuntu vm as a dhcp server also?
[02:08] <smuxi> yes hitsujiTMO
[02:09] <smuxi> hitsujiTMO: I have 1 ubuntu vm as dhcp, but seems that it has issues with the vmware fusion dhcp server
[02:09] <hitsujiTMO> smuxi: then you should have vmwares dhcp sever disabled. otherwise you're running into conflicts
[02:10] <Ben64> wait, how is that an ubuntu issue at all
[02:10] <Ben64> vmware on osx.....
[02:10] <smuxi> hitsujiTMO: makes sense
[02:10] <smuxi> I will work on that

[02:15] <Crazyzurfer> hey guys.. how do I know if my nvidia 650m driver is installed? --> using ubuntu 13.10
[02:16] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: can you see something on the screen?
[02:16] <Crazyzurfer> yes
[02:17] <uncle_ben> i have an issue with an older dell dimension 2400, during boot, bios always complains: alert: previous fan failure.  the fan works fine...i cleared the system event log and it made no difference.  one thing i noticed is the the fan cable has four female connectors, but the mobo fan connector has only three pins...could that have something to do with the error message
[02:17] <omnomnOMINOUS> Crazyzurfer, try going to Software & Updates > Additional Drivers?
[02:17] <Crazyzurfer> but I've got 2 video cards, and I know one of them is obviously working, but I want to know if the nvidia driver is installed
[02:17] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: it's installed ... you can see what drivers are getting loaded in your xorg log ... /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[02:17] <omnomnOMINOUS> I think that should tell you whether a proprietary video card driver is installed.
[02:17] <uncle_ben>  i got the computer used, so not sure if fan is original, but it works
[02:17] <omnomnOMINOUS> If I had chosen "encrypt my home folder" when I installed ubuntu 13.04, and now I want to do a clean install of 13.10 on top of it, without destroying my old data, is that possible? If I choose "encrypt my home folder" again, with the same password, will that be safe?
[02:18] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: you might want to have a look at this to get your optimus running: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee
[02:19] <msdw> omnomnOMINOUS: you could try to update from the cd this way it  respects your data
[02:20] <hitsujiTMO> uncle_ben: sounds like someone replaced it with the wrong type of fan.
[02:20] <omnomnOMINOUS> msdw: I want to do a clean install, because my old install was broken. =/
[02:20] <Crazyzurfer> hitsujiTMO: I've got it, because when upgraded to 13.10 I didn't have graphic interface, installed it and then worked... by the way that xorg log doesn't say anything about nvidia
[02:20] <msdw> then the safes way is to back up you home and then do fresh install
[02:21] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: have you run optirun on anything to test it?
[02:21] <Crazyzurfer> omnomnOMINOUS: It doesn't say anything.. it says, there are no aditional drivers
[02:21] <Crazyzurfer> hitsujiTMO: nope, how can I do that?
[02:21] <uncle_ben> hitsujiTMO, i mean it's not critical...the fan works..i just hit F1 and keep going, but it's kind of annoying

[02:24] <Crazyzurfer> hitsujiTMO: ran optirun firefox and got: (process:5661): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0' failed --> is that normal?
[02:24] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: install mesa-utils that gives you glxgears. run it from the command line with and without optirun ... if theres a noticable difference in fps then you're good
[02:25] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: that looks like a known bug in firefox. try glxgears
[02:26] <uncle_ben> donavan01, try sudo lshw (assuming you have that package installed...if not...install it)
[02:27] <donavan01> I tried that and the only thing it says under wlan0 is wireless interface
[02:27] <NCS_One> hitsujiTMO: thanks, I'll try it later
[02:27] <Crazyzurfer> hitsujiTMO: I see not difference, both worked at 59.8 and 59.9 fps
[02:28] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: its vsyncing ... i get 1k fps on a crappy gpu
[02:29] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: 2 secs, ill see how to turn off the vsync
[02:30] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: do you have nvidia settings installed?
[02:32] <Crazyzurfer> hitsujiTMO: the only thing I've installed is bumblebee and bumblebee-nvidia, nothing else... should I have it? :)
[02:32] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: can you try run it with by typing: vblank_mode=0 glxgears
[02:32] <Crazyzurfer> I'm new with ubuntu
[02:32] <Crazyzurfer> :O got
[02:32] <Crazyzurfer> vblank_mode=0 glxgears
[02:33] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: and then ofcourse try: optirun vblank_mode=0 glxgears

[03:07] <ironcamel> i'm trying to run gnome classic, but it is not showing up in my sessions list on the login screen. do i need to install a certain package to get it?
[03:07] <hitsujiTMO> jon1233: click on package details, then choose your architecture then you can download the debs
[03:08] <jon1233> I am on windows
[03:08] <jon1233> I cannot use those terminal commands
=== theinova is now known as inova
[03:08] <Dr_Willis> ironcamel:  yes. depends on what ubuntu verion you are running
[03:08] <jon1233> Windows computer has internet, ubuntu computer no internet
[03:08] <Dr_Willis> !classic | ironcamel
[03:08] <ubottu> ironcamel: The default interface in Ubuntu 11.04 is !Unity. To switch back to regular !GNOME: log out, click your username, click the Session box at the bottom of the screen, and select "Ubuntu Classic". For 11.10, see !notunity
[03:08] <jon1233> usb to connect
=== inova is now known as theinova
[03:08] <ironcamel> Dr_Willis: i am using ubuntu 13.10
[03:08] <Dr_Willis> ironcamel:  gnome-shell has its own classic-gnome-2 look. Im not sure if the other classic modes exist in 13.10
[03:09] <Dr_Willis> ironcamel:  i have it. but i think i innstalled the 'ubuntu-gnome-desktop' package
[03:09] <Dr_Willis> thats going to install all of gnome-shell
[03:09] <ShayGuy> Dr_Willis: How specifically should I be searching? There are dozens of directories named "config" or "cache" in /home/myname.
[03:09] <Dr_Willis> ShayGuy:  .config is first place to look.
[03:10]  * ironcamel is installing ubuntu-gnome-desktop ...
[03:10] <Dr_Willis> ShayGuy:  i got a .config/google-chrome and  .config/chromium  here

[03:11] <maxxx> hi
[03:11] <jon1233> :(
[03:11] <philwdsa> hi
[03:11] <maxxx> how i can install libgmp3c2 on ubuntu 13.04 amd64
[03:11] <Dr_Willis> !find libgmp3c2
[03:11] <philwdsa> is there a way to set video thumbnail previews?
[03:11] <ubottu> Package/file libgmp3c2 does not exist in saucy
[03:11] <ironcamel> the main thing i don't like about gnome is the alt tab behavior, it kills my workflow, thats why i want to try gnome classic ... just upgraded to gnome 13.10 and it broke my cinnamon
[03:11] <philwdsa> for avi's and mpegs?
[03:11] <jon1233> How do I install VLC package from https://launchpad.net/~videolan/+archive/stable-daily onto my windows machine, then move it to Ubuntu machine (no internet) via USB?
[03:12] <ShayGuy> Dr_Willis: All right. I've got a /home/myname/.config/google-chrome and a /home/myname/.config/google-chrome-beta, along with .config/chromium.
[03:12] <philwdsa> I only see them for images
[03:12] <maxxx> for zimbra
[03:12] <maxxx> how
[03:12] <maxxx> i can add
[03:12] <maxxx> in saucy ?
[03:12] <ironcamel> ubuntu-gnome-desktop is installing the entire internet it seems like
[03:12] <Dr_Willis> philwdsa:  Hmm. I see them for videos. i think theres some max file size config to let nautilus make them.
=== lanr3fn1_sn3m is now known as Lacon1c
[03:13] <Dr_Willis> ironcamel:  alt-tab in unity uses compiz. and has a lot of settings you can tweak
[03:13] <ShayGuy> Dr_Willis: And .config/google-chrome is more than four times the size of the larger of the other two. I think we're on the right track.
[03:13] <Dr_Willis> ironcamel:  not sure about gnome-shell or the classic mode
[03:13] <philwdsa> Dr_Willis: where can this be adjusted?
[03:13] <jon1233> How do I install VLC package from https://launchpad.net/~videolan/+archive/stable-daily onto my windows machine, then move it to Ubuntu machine (no internet) via USB?
[03:13] <philwdsa> not sure if its the problem because I have penty of small video files
[03:13] <Dr_Willis> philwdsa:  I see them for videos by default for local videos. I not for ones over the network shares.
[03:13] <msdw> jon1233: why dont you download the code for the vlc and compile it on the linux machine
[03:13] <jon1233> i dont know how
[03:14] <jon1233> someone told me to go to https://launchpad.net/~videolan/+archive/stable-daily and download
[03:14] <Dr_Willis> philwdsa:  i notice i DONT see them for .webm videos
[03:14] <philwdsa> but for avi you do?
[03:14] <odium> Why would playback of a bluray in vlc be effected  by using makemkv to copy and decrypt an unrelated bluray iso?
[03:14] <msdw> when you download the code it comes with install instructions
[03:14] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  you will need to also download ALL the dependencies.. that can be a lot of differnt packages
=== k is now known as Guest24257
[03:14] <Dr_Willis> jon1233: most likely the .deb package by itself wont install. it will want other dependencies also
[03:15] <jon1233> :(
[03:15] <philwdsa> Dr_Willis: also I will add, I am trying to view the thumbnails on a external hd
[03:15] <jon1233> How do I just make it work
[03:15] <msdw> usuali you use comands like ./configure, make, make install
[03:15] <philwdsa> but not sure why that would make a difference
[03:15] <jon1233> Is there no easy way to do this?
[03:15] <BlackWeb> Just curious I have a HP Laserjet that I have Connected to my machine, Which if my PC has been running for a long period of time it seems like the Printer doesnt communicate with the PC, To where I have to Unplug & Replug the printer back-in  in order to print to, Which I've tried doing service cups restart to have it re-spool the printer but it doesnt work, Is there another command I can use, Which seems like I did it before?
[03:15] <jon1233> in windows I just download vlc.exe and put on USB and done
[03:15] <jon1233> ubuntu = ???
[03:15] <Dr_Willis> philwdsa:  external usb hd with videos i get thumbnails here
[03:15] <ShayGuy> Dr_Willis: The launcher icon says "Google Chrome (beta)," too -- probably significant. Can I check what process it links to?
[03:15] <philwdsa> Dr_Willis: hmm... strange
[03:15] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  you should connect to the internet and download it with the package manager
[03:15] <msdw> jon1233:you can do the deb installation but just download the deendencies
[03:16] <jon1233> I cant no internet adapter on that computer
[03:16] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  thats how ubuntu is designed to work.
[03:16] <Dr_Willis> run a cable
[03:16] <jon1233> no internet adapter
[03:16] <jon1233> not even place to plug in cable
[03:16] <Dr_Willis> otherwise you are going to spend i imagine several hours at this
=== lanr3fn1_sn3m is now known as Lacon1c
[03:16] <jon1233> so much for ease of use
[03:16] <Dr_Willis> its designed for mondern people who do have internet.
[03:16] <jon1233> windows works fine without internet
[03:17] <jon1233> Is there no big file I can download that contains all the dependencies?
[03:17] <msdw> jon1233:hey do you have a smart phone, u can use tether to share the internet
[03:17] <jon1233> One big file that has it all and can auto-install?
[03:17] <Dr_Willis> jon1233: not that i have EVER seen.
[03:17] <Dr_Willis> ubuntu has a built in video player..
[03:18] <shan> hey i'm having some trouble with editing my partitions, I have gparted installed and useable as a LiveUSB app, when i boot it, it puts me in  a debian desktop where i can use gparted... but i need help, here are my partitions: http://i.imgur.com/qResR5Y.png
[03:18] <msdw> jon1233: only conected to the internet you can do the apt-get install vlc
[03:18] <jon1233> I dont have a smartphone
[03:18] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  or find some ubuntu system that does have networking and use the apt-on-cd tool
[03:18] <Dr_Willis> or even a ubuntu live-usb
[03:18] <jon1233> Is there a way to get the restricted codecs installed?
[03:18] <jon1233> I dont need VLC so much as codecs
[03:18] <jon1233> just any video player that can play most video files
[03:18] <Dr_Willis> codecs might be a single package
[03:19] <jon1233> I downloaded them from that packages.ubuntu.com place
[03:19] <jon1233> restricted-codecs-59.tar.gz
=== javi is now known as Guest68120
[03:19] <Dr_Willis> download everything that looks like you may need the .deb not the tar.gz
[03:19] <jon1233> but it wouldn't load in the software thing in ubuntu
[03:19] <Dr_Willis> .tar.gz would be source code
[03:19] <Ari-Yang> jon1233: download the .deb and make sure you have the required dependencies of vlc https://wiki.videolan.org/Contrib_Status/
[03:19] <Dr_Willis> in most cases
[03:19] <Ari-Yang> jon1233: or you can configure https://wiki.videolan.org/Configure/
[03:20] <Ari-Yang> as in compile from source
[03:20] <Ari-Yang> good luck
[03:20] <msdw> jon1233: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
[03:20] <Dr_Willis> vlc last i looked - pulled in quite a few dependencies on a normal install of ubuntu
[03:20] <jon1233> There are 20+
[03:20] <jon1233> i have vlc.deb
[03:20] <jon1233> but it needed dependencies
[03:21] <Dr_Willis> yep ;)
[03:21] <jon1233> is deb file like exe?
[03:21] <FoShizz> Hello!
[03:21] <Dr_Willis> a .deb is the package you install
[03:21] <jon1233> so like .msi
[03:21] <Dr_Willis> its NOT an executable..
[03:21] <Dr_Willis> its like an .apk on android. :)
[03:22] <xrandr> I got cinnamon to work
[03:22] <FoShizz> What would happen if I typed rm -rf /* on a livecd? Does it wipe the livecd permanently? Or does it wipe the entire computer as well?
[03:22] <xrandr> the only way to make it work is via the ppa, not the repos
[03:22] <Dr_Willis> FoShizz:  hope you dont have any hard drives mounted to /media/
=== newbie is now known as Guest16023
[03:22] <FoShizz> If there are harddrives, they all get wiped?
[03:22] <Dr_Willis> FoShizz:  and ithink rm -rf/ has a failsafe these days - you need extra optins to do it
[03:22] <Dr_Willis> FoShizz:  if they are MOUNTED
[03:23] <FoShizz> Is there a quick way to unmount all harddrives?
[03:23] <mojtaba> Hi,
[03:23] <jon1233> Is there anyway to install restricted-extras via this http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/u/ubuntu-restricted-extras/
[03:24] <Dr_Willis> FoShizz:  not that ive noticed.. theres differnt ways they can get mounted.. and if they are in use. you might need to force them to unmount
[03:24] <jon1233> Files look too small
[03:24] <FoShizz> dang
[03:24] <mojtaba> I am using 13.10 and the clock is just disappeared from the top right of the desktop. Does anybody know what should I do?
[03:24] <FoShizz> What's a good way to mess with someone who uses a livecd?
[03:24] <Dr_Willis> ubuntu-restricted-extras is JUST a meta-package jon1233  its job is to pull in the other packages in an easy way
[03:24] <FoShizz> Without damaging the acutal hdd?
[03:25] <jon1233> Are the original files available for download that can be transferred on usb?
[03:25] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  the dependencies for that package are also .debs yopu can download and install. thats how the apt system works
[03:25] <jon1233> have to transfer on usb after
[03:25] <Dr_Willis> foo pulls in bar and fii... you could install bar and fii seperately
[03:25] <mojtaba> I am using 13.10 and the clock is just disappeared from the top right of the desktop. Does anybody know what should I do? I searched clock in unity, but it is greyed out.
[03:27] <jon1233> Is there a website that has the restricted-extras .deb files for 13.10 for download alone?
[03:27] <Polymorph> Hello
[03:28] <Polymorph> I need some help please
[03:28] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  the ubuntu-restricted-extas is a 'meta pacakge' it has no real content. it just 'depends' on the OTHER .deb packages
[03:28] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  so install ing it  - forces the system to get the other packages. and saves typeing. ;)
[03:28] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  ubuntu-desktop works the same way
[03:28] <jon1233> Can I get those "other packages" from somewhere?

[03:29] <ShayGuy> Dr_Willis: On the left side of the screen.
[03:29] <Dr_Willis> ShayGuy:  launch it and try the about menu item and see perhaps? or use ps ax to see whats running
[03:30] <Polymorph> I cannot login to Ubuntu forums today - yesterday was OK - firefox hangs at the address "https://login.ubuntu.com/j7l6Bkxx9zdlwRXq/+decide"

[03:35] <FoShizz> If I delete /etc, will I cripple a computer?

[03:40] <FoShizz> from the livecd that is
[03:40] <msdw> its a live cd that can be changed any changes you make when you reboot it will be the same
[03:40] <FoShizz> oh so you can store data on a livecd?
[03:41] <msdw> yes, but make sure that you dont have a mounted partition
[03:41] <FoShizz> wait idgi
[03:41] <msdw> on the cd no, on a usb yes
[03:41] <FoShizz> ok
[03:42] <FoShizz> yea cuz i thought files livecd's restart everytime while usbs can be permanent

[03:50] <jmgk> good good
[03:50] <jon1233> is there
[03:50] <jon1233> !aptonusb
[03:50] <jmgk> anudas:  on a laptop or desktop

[03:50] <xmetal> i usually just backup the DEB files themeselves, though APTtoCD is a good app
[03:50] <Dr_Willis> ShayGuy:  i dont know eitehr. i dont know what you are doing.  there MIGHT be a .desktop launcher for the non beta one. i imagine the command will be the same only without the beta :)

[03:51] <jon1233> how do I get the "show desktop" button on 13.10
[03:51] <jmgk> ah
[03:52] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  i recall theres some check box in one of the settings tools to enable it.
[03:52] <Dr_Willis> I never need it. ;) my desktop is blank

[03:53] <jon1233> hmm
[03:53] <jon1233> the ubuntu machine i have connected to internet is 10.04 LTS
[03:53] <jon1233> will apt-get VLC for the CD repository still work?
[03:53] <jon1233> to transfer to 13.10 cpu?
[03:55] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  thats going to make things a lot harder.

[03:55] <jon1233> can i use the 13.10 cd to boot off of
[03:55] <msdw> jon1233: the best way would be to compile it
[03:55] <jon1233> msdw how do i do that?
[03:55] <Dr_Willis> boot the 13.10 cd on the pc with the networking.. intall vlc.. see wht it downlaods
[03:56] <Dr_Willis> copy styff to flash.. move it over
=== dziegler_off is now known as dziegler
[03:56] <Dr_Willis> compile it? thats not the best way. he would have to download ALL the dev pcakges and stuff
[03:56] <Dr_Willis> then hope he can compile it
[03:56] <jmgk> hi Dr_Willis
[03:57] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:   a live usb with a persistant save file. with 13.10 - you could then install vlc on it.. and get the debs it used
[03:57] <Dr_Willis> is another way. (or use it to make an apt-on-usb setup)
[03:57] <jon1233> !apt-on-usb
[03:58] <jon1233> why cant ubuntu just have one file that installs it
[03:58] <jon1233> like windows has .exe
[03:58] <jon1233> can put exe on usb
