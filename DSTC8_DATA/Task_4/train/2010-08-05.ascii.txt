=== GarbageMobileDev is now known as mtm
[07:41] <mtm> Whats the best linux OS
[07:41] <mtm> besides Fedora
[07:41] <hermanlf> Anyone know how I can install the beam up animation plugin for compiz?
[07:41] <mtm> :)
[07:41] <PythonPup> mtm, the one that serves your needs.
[07:41] <red2kic> mtm: You're in #ubuntu -- We'll say Ubuntu. ;O
[07:41] <kvio04> Ubuntu is not letting me create new partitions in gparted. The error is "/dev/sdc1 is apparently in use by the system; will not make a filesystem here!" however, dev/sdc1 does not exist
[07:42] <mtm> LOL
[07:42] <kvio04> Any way around it?
[07:42] <Gnea> kvio04: use a livecd
[07:42] <kvio04> Gnea: this /is/ a livecd :/
[07:42] <mtm> Okay, my needs are iphone and web design
[07:42] <xangua> hermanlf: just activate 'animations add-on' in compizconfig seting maanger
[07:42] <Gnea> kvio04: so what is /dev/sdc1 being used by?
[07:42] <PythonPup> kvio04, what do you get from    sudo fdisk /sdc
[07:43] <hermanlf> xangua: I have, but that animation doesn't seem to be there.  Let me double check.
[07:43] <PythonPup> kvio04, oops, make that    what do you get from    sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
[07:43] <xangua> animation <unconvertable>
[07:43] <Gnea> sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc perhaps?
[07:43] <kvio04> No devices are listed
[07:43] <PythonPup> Gnea, even better.  I usually run it and then do a p.
[07:44] <kvio04> No partitions, rather
[07:44] <kvio04> I see the columns but they're empty
[07:44] <hermanlf> xangua, well hell, there it is lol.  Now even more animations have shown up.  I could have sworn I only had a few just a minute ago.
[07:44] <PythonPup> Then gparted can't make a partition, because the system does not see the drive, kvio04
[07:44] <Gnea> kvio04: well something isn't right
[07:44] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: i looked for dropbox but wont it make a folder on botth machines which folder will sync automatically and always have the same contents
[07:44] <kvio04> The system does see it. The drive is listed, just no partitions
[07:44] <kvio04> I'll pastebin it
[07:44] <greezmunkey> *Q* is there an _accurate_ system monitor out there that doesn't scew results by virtue of its own overhead?

[07:45] <Wiesshund> red2kic apt://netmon-applet
[07:45] <`blackmk4`linux> is there a command to write the current mounting setup to fstab

[07:46] <`blackmk4`linux> if you are bored with ubuntu
[07:46] <el_seano> that's what I'm planning, anyway.

[07:47] <kvio04> PythonPup, Gnea: Both drives are listed there -- just no partitions under sdc
[07:47] <Gnea> `blackmk4`linux: what's that supposed to mean?
[07:47] <kvio04> PythonPup, Gnea: I tried rewriting the MFT again from scratch, which also seems to make no difference
[07:47] <PythonPup> kvio04, OK, you just don't have a partition table.
[07:47] <`blackmk4`linux> what that means
[07:47] <`blackmk4`linux> is that if he is bored he isn't learning anything
[07:48] <Gnea> kvio04: that shows that /dev/sdc is a 320G disk that hasn't been used yet
[07:48] <greezmunkey> RealEyes: pick a project, then see it through - like learning bash scripting. That'll keep you thinking.
[07:48] <`blackmk4`linux> if he's not learning anything then either he isn't trying new things or he knows everything
[07:48] <PythonPup> kvio04, try   sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
[07:48] <kvio04> PythonPup: I've recreated the MFT five or six times trying to recover this thing
[07:48] <Gnea> RealEyes: tried any other distros?
[07:48] <kvio04> Gnea: The drive was being used, it had four partitions until today
[07:48] <RealEyes> I'm trying to learn bash but I don't know where to tart.
[07:48] <RealEyes> start* lol
[07:48] <kvio04> Gnea: rewrote the MFT for other purposes
[07:48] <PythonPup> kvio04, Are you trying to recover data on a drive that had some problem?
[07:48] <kvio04> PythonPup: This is a different drive from that one
[07:48] <RealEyes> It looks like art to me, the bash shell.
[07:48] <Gnea> kvio04: what's the MFT?
[07:48] <`blackmk4`linux> bash as in scripting?
[07:48] <kvio04> PythonPup: Same computer, different drive
[07:49] <RealEyes> I haven't tried other distros.
[07:49] <Gnea> RealEyes: try 'hello world'
[07:49] <RealEyes> I'd like to get conky working and -- whats hello world?
[07:49] <`blackmk4`linux> i suggest you write a motd that gathers some info from the system every time you ssh in
[07:49] <kvio04> Gnea: there were 4 partitions on here and a Ubuntu install failed, so we rebooted the machine from livecd and tried to create a new master file partition from gparted
[07:49] <Gnea> RealEyes: that's your problem. I suggest debian and slackware.

[07:50] <Gnea> RealEyes: "hello world" is the most basic program in any programming language in the world.

[07:50] <PythonPup> kvio04,   Run  sudo fdisk/dev/sdc    and choose option o to write a new partition table.  Depending on what it says, you may have to reboot as the next step.

[07:58] <`blackmk4`linux> either way, fun times.
[07:58] <`blackmk4`linux> later, weiss
[07:58] <PythonPup> kvio04, I would probably run spinrite on the drive.  But, reboot first.
[07:59] <PythonPup> kvio04, spinrite is a commercial, proprietary app.  But, I build enough PCs that I bought a copy.
[08:00] <PythonPup> I wish there were something open that worked half as well as spinrite.  Beter would even be better, but it would be nice to have something basic.

[08:03] <MACscr> anyone running colorzilla for firefox with their 64bit ubuntu system? Its driving me nuts that i cant get that plugin to work and i normally use it on a daily basis
[08:03] <kvio05> PythonPup: the specific partition it says is in use (/dev/sdc1) was a 500mb /boot partition before failure. also, the drive is USB. would either of those factors play a role?
[08:04] <PythonPup> kvio05, I don't see how.
[08:04] <kvio05> PythonPup: not possible that the livecd automatically is doing something with /boot on startup?
[08:05] <meral_k> hi all!
[08:05] <PythonPup> The live CD does not alter your hard drives automatically.  That would be a real big nono.
[08:05] <kvio05> PythonPup: if it were something simply just wrong with the drive itself..it seems odd to me that gparted would specifically identify /dev/sdc1 as the problem (even when there is no 1)
[08:05] <Wiesshund> kvio05 can you plug the drive in after boot?
[08:05] <LUCHO_2385> hellooooooooo :D
[08:05] <kvio05> Wiesshund: very good idea, i'll try that right now (or actually someone else will, i'm doing this all via teamviewer)
[08:06] <PythonPup> kvio05, did you reboot?
[08:06] <meral_k> i see new updates now "linux 2.6.32-24". but i already use this version of linux. so what should i do now ? can we check which version of linux i use from terminal ?
[08:06] <kvio05> PythonPup: was waiting on a response from the person physically there
[08:06] <Wiesshund> kvio05 i mean if you think the livecd is trying to do something with /boot on it. im thinking not but no harm in checking
[08:06] <kvio05> PythonPup: will respond with result shortly
[08:06] <razz11> i installed freenx and I see x11vnc  server under applications > internet, is that normal? and I already have a custom ssh keys setup between the server and the client. which I use regularly to connect to the server. I guess I will not need one more. can someone point me in the right direction as to how to set up freenx
[08:07] <PythonPup> meral_k,   uname -a   will show your current kernel.  It must be a minor update.
[08:07] <rww> meral_k: PythonPup's right, it is. It's a security update that came out today.
[08:07] <meral_k>  rww:  PythonPup: ok thanks!
[08:08] <Wiesshund> razz11 its normal to see x11vnc server there, cant answer the other
[08:08] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: sry smth happened with my internet
[08:09] <PythonPup> razz11, I have not used it recently, so I better let someone else help.  I use VNC all the time.  Freenx is preferred for remote control of remote systems, but I don't do that.
[08:09] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: anything found on my problem? I looked for sshd but it doesn't seem to be the kind of software i need
[08:09] <razz11> Wiesshund: thnx,
[08:09] <razz11> PythonPup: I use vnc, it's inefficient, and sluggish. even with compression
[08:10] <Wiesshund> razz11 x11vnc is the only one i found that would work with compiz and desktop effect
[08:10] <razz11> PythonPup: what server do you run, vino?
[08:10] <PythonPup> RAX_bg, There are several options.  Are these computer both at home or the same location?
[08:10] <razz11> Wiesshund: so freenx uses x11vnc. am I right?
[08:10] <Wiesshund> razz11 i believe so
[08:11] <razz11> k
[08:11] <PythonPup> razz1, I used the default one under System/Preferences/Remote Desktop.  On xubuntu, I setup vino.
[08:12] <Wiesshund> PythonPup only downside of that one is if the server is running compiz and desktop effects enabled, the screen doesnt update. If you can get the user to disable that stuff it works but..
[08:13] <PythonPup> razz11, freenx may fall back to vnc, but it's default protocol is much better.  That is why it is preferred for remote systems.  VNC control of a machine in a remote location can be painful.
[08:13] <LUCHO_2385> how can I edit a .pub file in ubuntu?
[08:13] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: no they both are part of one network but every computer of this network has real IP so i cant make something like LAN sharing, but what i want is to be able to see a folder like i see it when its shared in LAN because i want to use its contents without having the files on the client machine. is this possible?
[08:13] <KB1JWQ> LUCHO_2385: file $file.pub
[08:13] <KB1JWQ> What's it say?
[08:13] <LUCHO_2385> .pub is a publisher file

[08:21] <greezmunkey> aruntomar: the mlppp process sets up a virtual interface. When the mlppp connection is up, check in ifconfig to see what the system calls it.
[08:22] <dr0id> btw, I hope I can run more than 1cron jobs anytime, right ?
[08:22] <balr0g> hello guys, can anyone help me? im having issues on updating my kernel to 2.6.35 ... this is my grub.cfg : http://pastebin.com/rSNfn4Tv and this is the error booting the new kernel: http://pastebin.com/HEUR71mG can anybody help me please ? any clues?
[08:22] <rww> dr0id: yes, you can have as many as you want
[08:22] <dr0id> rww: thanks , that's awesome :)
[08:22] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, there is no virtual interface, i guess, my isp doesn't support mlppp
[08:23] <greezmunkey> aruntomar: there is the proviso! Both ends, remember?!
[08:23] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, can i use linux bridging concept to achieve this ?
[08:23] <PythonPup> RAX_bg, So, on their side, they will just browse for a windows share.   Let's say your machine is 123.234.56.78 and you call the shared area gamespace.   There are several ways they can do it.  I usually go to a command prompt and type    net use k: //123.234.56.78/gamespace
[08:24] <rounder> alow
[08:24] <PythonPup> RAX_bg, or maybe they put the slashess the other way.
[08:24] <greezmunkey> aruntomar: if you are trying to increase bandwidth by cobbing two desperate internet connections together - don't waste your time. You will have no end of problems with it.
[08:24] <PythonPup> RAX_bg, On your side, you just install samba nad setup a share.
[08:25] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: its the other way in win. my way to connect from win host is go to run and type \\IP\foldername
[08:25] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: i shared it with right click->sharing options
[08:25] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, oh :(
[08:25] <greezmunkey> aruntomar: It's just the way it rolls.
[08:25] <RAX_bg> because when i tried to install samba it said its already the newest version
[08:26] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, i thought may be with some other networking concept i could achieve this
[08:26] <PythonPup> RAX_bg, OK, then do it that way.
[08:26] <RAX_bg> another question
[08:26] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: do i need to configure the router
[08:26] <balr0g> hey guys, can anyone help on solving update kernel issue?
[08:26] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: i mean what port is samba using
[08:26] <PythonPup> RAX_bg, Then, just edit /etc/samba/smb.conf and add your new share and you are set.
[08:27] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, basically the client saw this kind of setup somewhere, those guys are using different 3G usb devices, and combining the network bandwidth
[08:27] <PythonPup> RAX_bg, Router?  Do both machines have public IP addresses.  You said that earlier.
[08:27] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, now he wants us to combine 2 or more 3G usb devices for uploading purposes
[08:28] <RAX_bg> well the router im behind does and the client machine has its own public IP
[08:29] <greezmunkey> aruntomar: There are two concepts, aggrigation and load balancing - you want load balancing.
[08:29] <PythonPup> Samba is not the most secure thing.  I don't suggest people expose it over the internet.  I thought y'all were in the same building.
[08:29] <KB1JWQ> PythonPup: Could always VPN it, but that's still ugly.
[08:30] <PythonPup> KB1JWQ, That is better than exposing your samba server to the world.
[08:30] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, ok. let me reconfirm the steps with u for mlppp, let me know if i'm doing something wrong
[08:30] <KB1JWQ> Yeah, but it's still something of an ugly hack.
[08:30] <KB1JWQ> I'd rather use something else for sharing files across a WAN.
[08:31] <PythonPup> RAX_bg, If your router is good enough, you can set it to only allow the samba ports from his IP address.  That would be pretty safe.

[08:31] <LUCHO_2385> bye bye
[08:32] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: yes i can do that but what ports the samba uses
[08:32] <TiK> or iptables
[08:32] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, i created 2 different files via pppconfig and tested them individually and they are working, i then added multilink in the 2 files created earlier
[08:32] <giantpune> can somebody help a sister out with some ubuntu mimetype stuff?  i want to associate files with the extension ".dol" with a program i wrote.  but by default in ubuntu they show up as "vnd.microsoft.icon" files.  where does ubuntu get this from and where can i change it?
[08:32] <disse> can anybody help me? I'm on a live CD
[08:32] <disse> http://codepad.org/h6CBpz9W
[08:32] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, then i start the ppp connection on both the files via pon command
[08:32] <disse> why he doesn't knows lvm? lvm2 is installed
[08:32] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: also as i want to run online game do i need to forward its ports too
[08:32] <greezmunkey> aruntomar: you won't be using mlppp to do load balancing - it will be an iptables, or squid excercise
=== akos is now known as Guest72599
[08:33] <PythonPup> RAX_bg, samba uses Port 135/TCP, Port 137/UDP, Port 138/UDP, Port 139/TCP, Port 445/TCP
[08:34] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, i can do load balancing with iproute2 as mentioned in lartc, haven't tried it with iptables or squid
[08:34] <RAX_bg> PythonPup:  ty and last what about the smb.conf file what do i need to add there is it something like that [foo]
[08:34] <RAX_bg> path = /home/bar
[08:34] <RAX_bg> read only = no
[08:34] <RAX_bg> guest ok = yes
[08:34] <FloodBot2> RAX_bg: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:34] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, m i following the steps for mlppp correctly? or m i doing something wrong there
[08:34] <PythonPup> RAX_bg, I see something about letting high ports outgoing through the firewall.  Most firewalls do that anyway.  I have not setup samba exposed to the internet.  Someone else may comment on that.
[08:35] <th0r> giantpune: I think that is defined in the mimetypes, so you might try starting there. But I have never edited them so I am not sure
[08:35] <RAX_bg> PythonPup: ok ill play around with it ty very much
[08:35] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, the point is that if mlppp works then it's great, but it doesn't , then what are my options, like iptables or squid
[08:35] <PythonPup> RAX_bg,  a bunch of stuff.  I don't have my samba template here.
[08:36] <giantpune> thats where im looking th0r.  buth theres liek 2000 different files and folders for mimetypes

[08:40] <disse>  why he doesn't knows lvm? lvm2 is installed

[08:41] <TiK> question: I have an asus laptop.. when I close it and reopen it the monitor is dark and I have to reboot.. why?
[08:41] <greezmunkey> aruntomar: when you asked if it was possible to "combine" two ppp links, I responded with "mlppp" - once you described your desired result I told you that mlppp is not the tool you need. You want to set up a load-balancing application with iptables. This is not a task for the faint of heart, but it does work.
[08:41] <SwedeMike> balr0g: try makig a kernel package instead, then you might get all initrd etc as well.
[08:41] <mikubuntu> my friend (who is 94) called me today to come over .. all of a sudden, his internet wasn't working.  he has some kind of 'support' contract (and i use the term loosely) and had already been on the phone with them, and they only wanted $130 to diagnose it for him.  i popped in the keychain usb i just made the other day, and set the bios to boot from the usb.  a minute later, we were running live, and online.

[08:42] <SwedeMike> th0r: wrong person.

[08:42] <balr0g> th0r, yes i update it...

[08:46] <cgtobi> gotta go, cya
[08:46] <balr0g> th0r, thata makes sense, how to solve it?
[08:46] <MaRk-I> balr0g: did you,   sudo update-initramfs -c -k 'yourkernelversion.3bla" before doing the grub update?
[08:46] <ghoulsblade> thanks, will give it a try.  updatedb : yes, two of them even, but i see it everytime i look, shouldn't be running all the time right ?
[08:47] <th0r> balr0g: that is the new grub file, so I don't know how it is defined. In the old days I would just edit menu.lst
[08:47] <balr0g> MaRk-I, no man, will try it...
[08:47] <mikubuntu> so, he decided he was ready to try the new system.  alas, when i started the installer, it would not get past the first partitioning, and i got a message that it could not set up the ext4 file.  i wish i had save the whole message, because it mentioned also something about raid apparently.  i spent about an hour in one of these channels, but couldn't make any headway on what the problem might be.  i've never had a hangup like this b
[08:47] <mikubuntu> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/473324/
[08:48] <aruntomar> greezmunkey, so if iptables is unreliable should i look for proxy load balancing via squid

[08:50] <PythonPup> mikubuntu, It looks like you have no free space to put linux.  You will need to add a new drive or wipe one of those or uses a live CD or use partition magic.

[08:53] <PythonPup> mikubuntu, Knowing the exact error would help.
[08:53] <mikubuntu> i'm home now, have to go back tomorrow nite.  i can get on irc using the livecd as i ws today
[08:53] <PythonPup> mikubuntu, the 4 gb drive is probably a pen drive.  Is that right?
[08:54] <greezmunkey> RealOpty: use the calculator, set it to "programming" then use the buttons at the top right to convert back and forth.
[08:54] <mikubuntu> guess the best bet will be to take my laptop over there tomorrow so i can check into the channel

[08:54] <mikubuntu> PythonPup: yes, its a lexar 4gb usb
[08:54] <TiK> looked*
[08:55] <mikubuntu> PythonPup: its the first boot usb i ever made, and it runs live just fine
[08:55] <PythonPup> mikubuntu, I have not made a USB boot.  So, you are ahead of me there.

[08:55] <mikubuntu> PythonPup: but can't get the install past the ext4 creation
[08:56] <PythonPup> mikubuntu, You probably picked the wrong option, but I am guessing.  You want remove all partitions and create default layout.
[08:56] <mikubuntu> PythonPup:   k, i check back in tomorrow when i'm in front of the machine again .. thanx!
[08:56] <PythonPup> mikubuntu, Now, I would do something else first.
[08:57] <mikubuntu> PythonPup: ok, whats that
[08:57] <PythonPup> mikubuntu, Is there data on either drive he wants to preserve?
[08:57] <mikubuntu> PythonPup: no data to preserve
[08:57] <balr0g> MaRk-I, it seems to be solved man... tks sudo update-initramfs -c -k 2.6.35 and sudo update-grub was the solution ...
[08:57] <MaRk-I> balr0g: nice
[08:58] <PythonPup> OK, then you are OK.  This is probably one of those dynamic raid setups that Windows supports.  mikubuntu, you need to erase the partitions on both drives.  That may be related to your problem.
[08:58] <yondie> hye , i found out in LTS 10.04 my X won`t start if there is no monitor attached to it
[08:58] <yondie> hwo can i solve it?
[08:59] <PythonPup> yondie, connect a monitor?
[08:59] <PythonPup> yondie, that was a trick question, right?
[08:59] <mikubuntu> PythonPup: what TWO drives?  does his machine have two drives?
[08:59] <Aemaeth> PythonPup, sometimes easier said than done, I had old soviet system, she was like landwhale, killed three men
[08:59] <yondie> nope
[08:59] <yondie> PythonPup:  i want to start it headlessly
[08:59] <yondie> but i need the X
[08:59] <yondie> to run
[09:00] <mikubuntu> PythonPup: is that RAID thing something that's on his drive that's impeding the setup?
[09:00] <PythonPup> mikubuntu, yes.  The fdisk -l shows two 80 gb drives.  If you open it and don't see two hard drives let us know.
[09:00] <PythonPup> mikubuntu, maybe.
[09:01] <mikubuntu> PythonPup: so, should i run 'darik's boot and nuke' on it before i try the install again?
[09:01] <Walex> yondie: configure it with an explicit X file. It does not start because by default it autodetects the monitor and autoconfigs it.
[09:02] <PythonPup> mikubuntu, you could.  The ubuntu installer should handle it, but wiping the drive could be a fallback position.
[09:02] <Antonio_> aloha folks..
[09:02] <PythonPup> yondie, Yes, that is what I was going to suggest.  create a xorg.conf file
[09:02] <mikubuntu> PythonPup: ok, i see you tomorrow .. thanks, i has to get to sleep

[09:15] <ubottu> kenwiliest: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[09:15] <gio1983> and, for example I can find out that /dev/sdb1 is a vfat partition
[09:15] <gio1983> coming from an usbkey
[09:16] <TiK> I think i's a bug
[09:16] <PythonPup> kenwiliest, The way root is used on Ubuntu has been the same since the first Ubuntu release.  You can setup a root account.  On servers, this is fairly commonly done.
[09:16] <gio1983> now, how can I find out idVendor and idProduct?
[09:16] <TiK> bc its switching from AC to battery power.........
[09:16] <gio1983> knowing this?
[09:16] <llutz> gio1983: lsusb
[09:17] <gio1983> but how can I make the binding /dev/sdb ---> Bus 002 Device 015: ID 0930:1400 Toshiba Corp.
[09:17] <PythonPup> TiK, is that your problem?  That it is switching from AC to battery.
[09:17] <star3am> hallo guys, anyone can hep with php5-mcrypt module ?
[09:17] <Benkinooby> PythonPup: i was wondering about the difference between ubuntu minimal install and ubuntu alternate install. i read about both of them, but i don't get the difference. looks like the minimal cd has only the most crucial packages, so everything has to be download from web for installation. the alternate cd is like the normal installation cd, but it runs with text interface and gives more chices during installation. is that coorect?
[09:17] <gio1983> lsusb does not tell which device file is associated to a certain device :\
[09:17] <Tohuw> is there a way to make an fstab include just for a certain user? e.g. user joe logs on and mounts everything in /etc/fstab, user john logs on and mounts everything in /etc/fstab AND another fstab-like file.
[09:17] <gio1983> does it?
[09:17] <llutz> gio1983: read "dmesg" output
[09:18] <Tohuw> Benkinooby: you are correct. The "extra choices" are related to setting up software RAIDs
[09:19] <PythonPup> Benkinooby, I think you have it.  The alternate gives you a full system.  It has more install options and is what I normally use.  The minimal install is used for servers and virtual machines, mostly.
[09:19] <gio1983> @llutz dmesg does not tell this info, unfortunately
[09:19] <TiK> PythonPup: Ive looked in the options under power managemet.. and when I am on AC I want it to be bright and when I lose my lid I want it to remain bright. when I a nnot on AC I want to display tobe dimmed so I checked "Reduce Backlight Brightness" under on battery per. Now whneer I close my lid and wakeup my computer "on AC power" its dim
[09:19] <Benkinooby> Tohuw: ok thank you.
[09:19] <TiK> lose/close
[09:19] <PythonPup> Benkinooby, the important option for me on the alternate installer is the ability to setup encrypted disks.
[09:19] <Slart> Tohuw: I think fstab is parsed when the machine boots.. not when a user logs in.. so no.. I doubt you'll be able to work with the fstab that way
[09:20] <TiK> seems lik a big to me pythonpup
[09:20] <TiK> bug
[09:20] <llutz> gio1983: here it does
[09:20] <Benkinooby> PythonPup: so if a want ubuntu with flxbox (and no gnome; fluxbuntu seems to be dead) best is to use alternate cd
[09:20] <Slart> Tohuw: you could write a script that runs at login which mounts drives and such
[09:21] <llutz> gio1983: after plugin the stick in,  dmesg logs lines like :[ 6494.035797] sd 4:0:0:0: [sdb] 15753215 512-byte logical blocks: (8.06 GB/7.51 GiB)
[09:21] <Tohuw> Slart: that's what I assumed... is there a way to make an fstab entry only mount for a certain user? I need to shake off the brain-dust in this area, but I seem to remember you can specify for each mount instruction who can actually access it. The issue is that I have a cifs share I want to mount, but only one user should be able to get to it (the share mounts in their home anyway)
[09:21] <TiK> PythonPup: anyway tanks for trying I am posting this as a bug
[09:21] <gio1983> I get this for example
[09:21] <gio1983> http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/AWMMNKES
[09:21] <MACscr> is there anything i can do to automatically keep my gnome ftp bookmark connections alive? Im constantly having to refresh the folder when i want ot open a file. Most of hte time i have to do it a couple times
[09:22] <TiK> Tohuw: make a script and allow them to mount with sudo
[09:22] <rgnr> bgj
[09:22] <TiK> idk...
[09:22] <llutz> gio1983: it only gives raw-device (sdc) in your case
[09:22] <Slart> Tohuw: I think your best option is to set permissions on the mounted drive so that only the specified user can access it.. ie it will still be mounted but only some user(s) will be able to read the files
[09:22] <TiK> thats what I'd do
[09:22] <sylon> hi my phone shows up as 2 mass storage drives on windows (phone internal memory and microSD card) but on linux it only shows one (the internal memory), any ideas whats up?
[09:22] <TiK> Slart: yeah good idea
[09:23] <ElBano> help!
[09:23] <PythonPup> Benkinooby, The alternate CD will install gnome.  The kubuntu alternate CD will install KDE.  You would want the server CD, probably.  Then there is a package called fluxbox.  I have not tried it lately.  The lubuntu setup is what I use for a light desktop.
[09:23] <ElBano> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1294251
[09:23] <randhol>  Hi. I have setup to autoimport photos from camera, that works great. However, I get asked if I want to import from SD card every time I turn on the printer-scanner as it has a SD card inside. Is there a way to remove this question? I only want to import fram cameras automatically
[09:23] <gio1983> @llutz uhm that tells me the device [sdc] but it does not tell the usb bus thing where I can find idVendor etc..
[09:24] <Jordan_U> gio1983: "lsusb" or "ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/"
[09:24] <Tohuw> Slart: over the course of our conversation, I've realized I'm worrying about a non-issue: it doesn't matter who logs in, this share is only accessible by this user (hence the stored credentials file) and the share point is only accessible by them. It doesn't matter that it mounts for everyone; they still can't get to it. File this in /mountains-out-of-molehills
[09:24] <PythonPup> TiK, sorry I could not do more.  I need a laptop handy, I guess.  I have one, but it has no battery, so it really acts like a desktop.

[09:25] <llutz> gio1983: there is no "one command" to show you all that info. you have to look at several places if you need it
[09:25] <Benkinooby> PythonPup: lubuntu... i'll have a look at it, thx for the hint. instead of using server, maybe the minimal install would be better, due to the fact that only the packages i explicitly choose are installed
[09:25] <gio1983> @Jordan_U I can't use lsusb but the other suggestion might be interesting
[09:25] <gio1983> @llutz I know unforttunately
[09:25] <gio1983> in a previous project I was using gudev
[09:26] <gio1983> but here I can't use it :\
[09:26] <gio1983> it's Android :P
[09:26] <Tohuw> Benkinooby: if you're aiming for a very lean system, and understand just what you want, the minimal install is perfect, I've found
[09:26] <ph8> hey all, anyone know how i can fix a corrupted MBR on an NTFS Drive from ubuntu?
[09:26] <llutz> gio1983: write an udev-rule to assign a fixed device to your usb-id
[09:26] <PythonPup> Benkinooby, the minimal install would be fine.  Just expect that you will be adding a lot of basic stuff.  That is a decent way to start.\
[09:26] <frogzoo> I get a protracted beep on shutdown at the message "unmounting temporary file systems" - didn't use to do this - any clues to fix it?
[09:27] <Tohuw> ph8, the best way to fix it is with the FIXMBR command on any WINNT or higher install CD. Other ways are not as "safe".
[09:28] <ph8> can i make fixmbr available in a normal install rather than only in the 'recovery console'?
[09:28] <Benkinooby> Tohuw, PythonPup : thank you. thought the alternate cd would also give me choice about the packages to be "initally" installed.
[09:28] <PythonPup> frogzoo, Did you add some samba mounts recently.  I know it takes longer to shutdown, if I don't unmount my samba share.  I don't remember a beep. though.
[09:29] <PythonPup> Benkinooby, nope.  No package install options.
[09:29] <frogzoo> PythonPup: no it's a different issue to yours - the beep is really loud & intrusive - I figure it as an alarm of some sort
[09:29] <Tohuw> Benkinooby: PythonPup: It's a shame though, because ubuntu-server does give you those options; the alt cd really should too
[09:30] <Benkinooby> Tohuw, +1 ;)
[09:30] <MaRk-I> gio1983: lshw ??
[09:30] <Tohuw> frogzoo: it may be completely unrelated to unmounting the shares. have you tried fsck'ing, checking temperatures of CPU/hardware, checking fan states, etc.?
[09:31] <Tohuw> s/shares/drives
[09:31] <PythonPup> Tohuw, The alternate installer just uses the standard debian installer.  I like it the way it is, but if you want a change, you would need to convince debian, not ubuntu.
[09:31] <Tohuw> frogzoo: a memtest may also be in order. PythonPup: thank you for that information; I didn't know that.
[09:32] <PythonPup> The alternate installer disk has memtest.  Or, it did the last time I looked.
[09:32]  * Tohuw acknowledges that "ubuntu" is an African word for "I can't configure Debian"
[09:32] <frogzoo> Tohuw: I guess a fsck may well be in order, tks
[09:32] <Jordan_U> gio1983: This is really the wrong channel :)
[09:32] <Tohuw> PythonPup: It's on the Live CD as well
[09:33] <PythonPup> memtest is small.  I am glad they include it.
[09:33] <gio1983> @Jordan_U I know, but since android is basically linux with some minor change
[09:33] <jihad> Has anyone been able to use itunes and mount an itouch or iphone?
[09:33] <frogzoo> debian has no one to blame but themselves for ubuntu stealing their thunder
[09:33] <gio1983> I was trying to understand if some one had a similar issue
[09:33] <gio1983> in linux
[09:33] <gio1983> since in android it is more difficult to find answers
[09:33] <Jordan_U> gio1983: No, android is an operating system that happens to use the linux kernel :)
[09:34] <Tohuw> gio1983: this is not an Android support channel. Android has many major differences from Ubuntu. You would be best off pursuing an Android-specific support channel.

[09:51] <mtm> i installed 1.0.1 and i insralled in seperate files
[09:51] <Tohuw> spencer: the whole point is you won't "catch" a virus on Linux, unless you do something silly, like run an unknown executable as root

[09:54] <spencer> Alright thanks all, I'm out. Night
[09:54] <NightKhaos> PythonPup: *sigh* Same old agruement. The security model in Vista and above does not "encourage" users, in fact it's the best it's ever been. The majority of virues on Windows are now PEBKAC type errors, i.e. phishing and trojans.
[09:54] <NightKhaos> Anyways:
[09:54] <kenwiliest> decomp, you probably have to edit/add a line to a file like rc.conf or some shit
[09:55] <NightKhaos> Is it possible to do a multiple alais... i.e. I want to alais all binaries start with arm-none-eabi to arm-elf.
[09:55] <kenwiliest> decomp, i suggest you direct your attention to something like... the ubuntu documentation emphasizing  that topic
[09:55] <PythonPup> spencer, I just removed rootkits that had been installed on 30 Linux systems.   So, Linux can get them.  I don't know how they got in.  Someone else is doing the backtracking on that.
[09:56] <jetienne> q. i got a source package .dsc, _source.build, _source.change, and .targz, how can i recompile it ?
[09:56] <decomp> kenwiliest: The rc.conf file (/etc/rc.conf) is the core system configuration file used in Arch Linux.
[09:56] <mtm> So theres nothing suspicious about not having any trojans for over a year?
[09:56] <decomp> is that also used in ubuntu?
[09:56] <kenwiliest> decomp,  yes....
[09:56] <PythonPup> NightKhaos, I was being a little metaphorical.  Saying Vista is the most secure Windows is not a very high standard.  They still include IE, so they are not serious about security.
[09:56] <kenwiliest> also in freebsd too
[09:56] <kenwiliest> i think it's a universally vital file.
[09:57] <frenzied_coder> MaRk-I, thanks. works now.
[09:57] <NightKhaos> PythonPup: I'll grant you that, however IEs security model is improving.

[10:02] <NightKhaos> PythonPup: multiple alasies... I have two precompiled twochains on different machines, one of which I don't have admin access too so I can't update the toolchain. On one they are called arm-none-eabi-, however on the other they are called arm-elf-. I don't want to have to create a whole lot of symlinks in /usr/local/bin if I can avoid it, but I want to make sure that when I execute arm-elf-gcc it points to arm-none-eabi-
[10:02] <NightKhaos> gcc for example, that or do you know a way to make my makefiles contextual (i.e. it terms which gcc is valid and then uses that one)
[10:02] <PythonPup> kenwiliest, yes, as in ports.
[10:02] <kenwiliest> pythonpup, what are they called in arch?
[10:02] <NightKhaos> PythonPup: sed s/twochains/toolchains/ ... some typo.

[10:06] <PythonPup> NightKhaos, The only thing I would suggest is to write a script to create the symlinks for you.  Then, it is not much effort to keep it up to date.  Have the script inspect the  arm-none-eabi list to be sure it creates all the needed symlinks.

It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall - Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page, and DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[10:10] <alsem> Jasonwryan:  Let me go play with that page and see if I can get anywhere.  Thanks I'll let you know later how it worked out.
[10:10] <NightKhaos> PythonPup: fairly unlikely to change. I'll know if/when I upgrade the toolkit, so I can redo the links and delete the broken symlinks.
[10:10] <jasonwryan> alsem: np: it works for me

[10:11] <__goo__> Hey, which ubuntu distro is best suited for a 256 mb RAM system?
[10:12] <iceroot> __goo__: lubuntu
[10:12] <Gnea> __goo__: xubuntu
[10:12] <PythonPup> azlon1, System/Preferences/Remote Desktop to enable the server.   Install xvnc4viewer on the client side.
[10:12] <iceroot> __goo__: not xubuntu, its taking the same as ubuntu
[10:12] <__goo__> Gnea, i dont like XFCE
[10:12] <__goo__> iceroot, ah ok
[10:12] <Gnea> __goo__: neither do i
[10:12] <Gnea> ah, didn't know about lubuntu
[10:13] <iceroot> __goo__: have a look at lubuntu (lxde)
[10:13] <PythonPup> __goo__, I use regular ubuntu on systems with 256 meg of ram and they seem fine to me.
[10:13] <justin22885> i have a question... id like to install ubuntu command line with a light weight desktop to a USB flash drive of 16gb, what would be the recommended filesystem setup for this?
[10:13] <__goo__> PythonPup, even 10.04?
[10:13] <jasonwryan> __goo__: Crunchbang
[10:14] <PythonPup> __goo__, If I was going to make heavy desktop use of one, I would look at ubuntu or crunchbang.
[10:14] <TiK> hey
[10:14] <Gnea> PythonPup: with gnome? surely you jest
[10:14] <PythonPup> __goo__, yes, even 10.04
[10:14] <__goo__> its not heavy desktop use
[10:14] <__goo__> I just wanna get my mom to use Linux
[10:14] <__goo__> and the PC is just a 800 mhz 256 mb RAM system
[10:14] <justin22885> anyone know the best way to install ubuntu to a flash drive?
[10:15] <iceroot> !usb | justin22885
[10:15] <ubottu> justin22885: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[10:15] <justin22885> no iceroot.. install it TO a usb drive, not FROM, i was wondering what the optimal filesystem would be
[10:15] <the_fool> Hello all i'm working on a quick bash script to change my wallpaper on startup. Anyone know why: http://pastie.org/1076979  would return: arithmetic expression: expecting primary: "  % (24 + 1) "  ?
[10:15] <iceroot> justin22885: reread the text from ubottu
[10:15] <el_seano> man, ubottu is awesome.
[10:15] <PythonPup> Gnea, full blown gnome.  Startup is a little slow, but once it gets going, it is fine.  The system is an 800 MHz via and can't take more than 256 meg of ram.  I have a similar system with a P3/933 and 256 meg of ram and it is also ok.
[10:16] <__goo__> But i want it the distro to be easy to use, for a person shifting from Windoze
[10:16] <__goo__> PythonPup, which one u talking about
=== lag is now known as Guest27899
[10:16] <alsem> Jasonwryan:  I read through the article.  How will this affect smb and smbfs?  I was "using" Samba so can this run along side?  Do I need to undo Samba?
[10:16] <KrisWood> Ok new theme, I'm able to get the appearance preferences to correctly see the theme in the install menu if I rename the file with a .tar.gz extension, but it still doesn't show up in my available themes, what could cause this?
[10:16] <iceroot> justin22885: i am using ext2 on a ssd, because of the missing journal
[10:16] <PythonPup> __goo__, try ubuntu out and see what you think.  The biggest problem I have is first starting apps.  Firefox is a little slow to load, but does fine after that.
[10:17] <geese> salut tous le monde
[10:17] <__goo__> PythonPup, okie
[10:17] <jasonwryan> alsem: you only need samba if you want a windoze box o your network
[10:17] <el_seano> Firefox is always sort of slow to start.
[10:17] <el_seano> mostly why i made the jump to chrome.
[10:17] <geese> j'espere qu'il y a quelqu'un qui parle francais
[10:17] <__goo__> el_seano, FF 4 is much faster
[10:17] <dlandau> Firefox 4 starts up faster.
[10:18] <bacon> chrome's search bar is more powerfull.
[10:18] <tkahn6> LOAD -e "/home/tkahn/Desktop/google.pl"
[10:18] <tkahn6> thank you xchat
[10:18] <__goo__> bacon, but FF automatically loads the best result
[10:18] <PythonPup> el_seano, true, but the security on Firefox is so much better, I would not use anything else as my main web browser.
[10:18] <el_seano> i will admit i like that FF's search bar instantly grabs your bookmarks though, rather than the quick search
[10:18] <__goo__> bacon, i dont find that in chrome, it just does a google search
[10:19] <el_seano> PythonPup: Security in what regard, if I may ask?
[10:19] <alsem> jasonwryan:  I have a windows box on the network BUT when I go to Places --> Network --> Windows  I get an error message that it can't mount the server  or get some file from it.  So I thought I'd try something simple like a Ubuntu to Ubuntu machine.
[10:19] <justin22885> apparently id need to disable journaling on ext4, add the noatime option to fstab, and use /tmp in RAM
[10:19] <bacon> __goo__: i don't know if it exist in FF, but with chrome you can search directly on the website you need with a tabulation after the site's url
[10:20] <PythonPup> el_seano, Chrome has nothing like noscript.  Chrome does not have the hooks it needs.  Browsing the web without something like noscript is just crazy.
[10:20] <bacon> __goo__: I like how browsing and search are fast with it
[10:20] <KrisWood> Hmmm is gtk2 installed by default in the latest ubuntu? no idea why these themes aren't working :-/
[10:20] <jasonwryan> alsem: sorry, I can't help with samba - I only run Linux...
[10:21] <__goo__> bacon, i c, but check out FF 4's new features - Tab Candy is pretty useful esp as i have 50 - 100 tabs open usually
[10:21] <alsem> jasonwryan:  thanks anyway!
[10:21] <PythonPup> alsem, can you post your smb.conf file for me to look at?
[10:21] <bacon> __goo__: I have maxi 15 tabs opened, but I'll try it for sure ! I don't like using all the google services (:
[10:21] <justin22885> iceroot, i am reading an article about how ext4 without the journaling is more efficient than ext2
[10:21] <bacon> __goo__: mail, reader, browser...
[10:21] <jasonwryan> alsem: s'ok: someone here will have samba chops...
[10:22] <__goo__> bacon, ok
[10:22] <justin22885> found another article giving me a list of things to edit in fstab to tweak ext4 to work properly with it
[10:22] <el_seano> PythonPup: I just heard about noscript today, actually.  What do you mean by the hooks?  That Chrome couldn't support something like noscript?
[10:22] <bacon> justin22885: may you give me a link please?
[10:22] <sussler> hey dudes
[10:23] <sussler> are there any intermittent lockup problems with intel gfx on ubuntu lucid lynx

[10:23] <sussler> i am kind of getting pissed at suse
[10:23] <alsem> PythonPup:  Where is the smb.conf file located?  Myabe I can cut and paste it?  (In case you haven't figured yet I'm kind of new to this Ubuntu)
[10:23] <PythonPup> el_seano, Yes, the developer of noscript looked at Chrome and talked to people at Google.  Chrome cannot support noscript, but may do so in the future.

[11:51] <hiddenpearls> bibo: no
[11:51] <justin22885> first step is to load a liveCD, "tune2fs -o journal_data_writeback /dev/sdx1", then under fstab i used "/dev/sdx1 / ext4 noatime,nodiratime,data=writeback,nobh 0 0"
[11:52] <justin22885> then also under fstab added /var/log, /tmp, and /var/tmp to operate under tmpfs

[11:55] <waltercool> arzhar, are you developing something with libpng or you need it for an app?
[11:55] <lunavorax> Why is the line "force_color_prompt=yes" is commented in the .bashrc file ?
[11:55] <matrix> my ubuntu cant use some art icons theme
[11:56] <arzhar> bibo: it is, but trying to compile E gives me this Check if Evas was compiled with png module enabled and all required dependencies exist.
[11:56] <bibo> matrix: I've had that same issue. Go to gnome-look.org and there's several icon sets that actually do work
[11:56] <Laggie> I have some strange problems with the nano editor, the text is moved visibly one line too high, so when I start editing I edit the wrong line. To see the correct text on the line I need to use the right arrow key and punch through all text that I want to see correct first.
[11:56] <arzhar> im gonna try again with the dev package
[11:56] <Tecna> "Failed to retrieve share list from server" Somebody please help me figure out what's wrong with my samba server?   CLI output: http://pastebin.com/j3n4niis
[11:57] <bibo> arzhar: Oh yeah you're right, I had to get that package for something, I just can't recall what
[11:57] <arzhar> bibo: so if i want to compile something i need the dev package ?
[11:58] <MaRk-I> hiddenpearls: here's a step by step http://www.hackourlives.com/dual-boot-windows-7-and-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx/
[11:58] <bullgard4> [GNOME, Ubuntu 10.04.1] Why are there on one computer 2 processes gconf-helper, gdm-session-worker and gdm-simple-slave each? Ubuntu created them automatically. On another computer only 1 each.
[11:58] <demoneye> MaRk-I: I paste'ed this on xorg.conf, what should be the next thing? http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/aKz6mPwZ
[11:58] <k0sh> why o why when i PXEBOOT my ubuntu it tells me that it didnt found /lib/modules/2.6.32-21generic/modules.dep even tho that file exists in nfs exported dir, plus other distros netboot just fine, only ubuntu gives me such error and goes into kernel panic, dir is exported via nfs v3
[11:58] <aronaliaga> hola
[11:58] <aronaliaga> no me funciona
[11:58]  * demoneye is *blur*
[11:58] <aronaliaga> el chat en espanol
[11:58] <bibo> hiddenpearls: Well if you're dual booting, Ubuntu needs part of a harddrive specifically for itself. I don't know much about Wubi, I couldn't get it to work so I just dual booted.
[11:58] <aronaliaga> alguien me ayuda?
[11:59] <aronaliaga> q ocurre?
[11:59] <io> !es | aronaliaga
[11:59] <ubottu> aronaliaga: En la mayoria de canales de Ubuntu se habla solo en ingles. Si busca ayuda en espanol o charlar entra en el canal #ubuntu-es. Escribe "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y dale a enter.
[11:59] <MaRk-I> demoneye: next step is to restart X,   just log out and back in
