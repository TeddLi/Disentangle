<s> and i 'm already thinking about just uninstalling ubuntu and go back to win7 </s>

<s> <user> , i feel your pain , just hang on in there . </s>
<s> every time i try ubuntu , which is maybe every 12 to 24 months .... its the same sad experience </s>
<s> hmm . this guys <unk#a> has a differnt wireless card then what you said you had above . </s>
<s> for example , in windows i have the hardware manager displaying all my hardware and wether it has the newest drivers installed or whether there is a problem with it </s>
<s> why is there not such a thing in ubuntu ? or is there ? </s>
<s> the drivers are normally all built into the kernel . so its actualy only a few cases that you update just the 'drivers' </s>
<s> totally differnt design <unka> then how wondows does it </s>
<s> iirc the hardware manager in windows shows what hardware is installed based on the drivers installed . </s>
<s> even if it hadnt all the drivers , at least i would know what to look for and when it works ... second : i cant install chrome from the software center , same with brackets , same with sublime .. i could do it with apt-get , but then i only can start it from console and its not added to my " shortcut bar " </s>
<s> ive definatly had the windows hardware manager be brain dead . " insert driver disk for <unka'> pci wireless card' " great . ;) </s>
<s> chrome no , chromium-browser is in the software center </s>
<s> <user> : i had that too , but those times are gone since windows vista , stayed gone with win7 and havent come back with win8 </s>
<s> as for sublime . - the sublime faq . and i think the omgubuntu , and/or webupd8 blog site mention getting an icon launcher for it . </s>
<s> the last time that stuff occured was winxp </s>
<s> <user> : i had it happen with windows 7 just a few weeks ago . ;) </s>
<s> ok </s>
<s> but it was a very very cheap bit of hardware . ;) </s>

<s> <user> : lotta love in the channel </s>
<s> <user> yes it worked for old version of ubuntu like <unk#,> and nop no even working for a second </s>
<s> oh wow , thanks </s>
<s> <user> : you could always alter the sudoers file to allow that user to run <unka> as root . but from all the fuse docs ive seen in the last 10 min , all fuse enabled users should be able to use the fuse stuff </s>
<s> <user> : yes in fact i cant understand why its not working ... :( </s>
<s> kll : i have formated ( xubuntu ) two times because the amd gpu drivers crashed after reboot , i hope that i do not need to format the third time .. </s>

<s> <user> : that may be the core issue here . </s>
<s> only root has full access to that device </s>
<s> <user> : yea i understand what you mean ... any ideas ? </s>
<s> <user> : do you have a gui at all ? </s>
<s> <user> : you should look out what error happend and not just plain reformat . </s>
<s> <user> : <unka> must be done from cli </s>

<s> <user> : so you cant even run ntfs-config to <unka> the system to let users have full access to ntfs/vfat ? that would be an <unka> way </s>
<s> kll : will try , will atleast follow the yt guide <user> sent </s>
<s> <user> : a gui right now to just run that tool is what im asking about </s>
<s> not a gui later </s>
<s> <user> : partitions will always be <unk#a/> .. is this a problem for ntfs-3g ? </s>
<s> ntfs-config handles them both </s>

<s> <user> , think i 'll <unka> to a corner with my morning coffee :) </s>
<s> <user> : ok ill see if ntfs-config helps me </s>

<s> <user> , <unka> ? </s>
<s> <user> : in my case it always changes and i only know the label at runtime </s>
<s> <user> : so that label is always the same ? </s>
<s> <user> : no , it changes </s>
<s> <user> : i do n't see how to tell ntfs-config to allow non root users to mount fat partition though </s>
<s> <unk#a> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> theres a check box . </s>
<s> it applies to both </s>
<s> it says " allow to read/write to external devices " </s>
<s> it does not say anything else though </s>
<s> then you use the <unka/> tool that i cant rember to mount them </s>
<s> <user> : from cli whats the command then ? mount -l <unka$> <unka$/> ? </s>
<s> its not mount .. its some other command </s>
<s> might be at one of the following . </s>

<s> <user> : ext2/3/4 are closely related , in fact ext2 can even mount ext3 and 4 partitions </s>
<s> <user> : askubuntu.com has <unka> <unka/> on mounting ntfs/vfat with executable bit set on every file . </s>
<s> <unka_> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> how do i install <unka.> in ubuntu 12.04 ? </s>
<s> <user> : so when you mount using ntfs-3g you use " fuse " , which is " file system in user space " . one advantage of mounting it in userspace is that you can mount it without being root </s>
<s> i mistakenly deleted it </s>
<s> <user> : fat32 uses a linux in kernel driver and a " mount " call </s>
<s> <user> : but i need to mount <unk#a/> </s>
<s> yea </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> <user> : thats why i was looking at <unka> </s>
