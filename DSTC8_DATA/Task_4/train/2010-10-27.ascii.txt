[00:15] <josh1> how do I add a user picture, I am using xubuntu 10.04, can't get any help on the xubuntu channel
[00:16] <goltoof> Sean93,   rephrase the question
[00:16] <boysen> how do i edit my vnc server  what is the common files
[00:16] <boysen> how do i edit my config files of my vnc
[00:17] <switch10_> Sean93: wget http://www.gamershell.com/download_63072.shtml
[00:17] <gasull> Sean93: I use deluge for torrents and works pretty well
[00:17] <Sean93> 1. why does this torrent make every torrent program freeze?
[00:17] <Sean93> 2. how can i download the file using the 9GB i have already downloaded?
[00:17] <Praxi> Just go through control panel thing, sorry new to ubuntu Boysen, but I have seen the port number specified
[00:17] <sympt0m> is there any sort of command that will display ifconfig similar to ipconfig on windows? i want gateway, ipv4, subnet, and mac listed
[00:17] <Aemaeth> null__, yes, it had some trouble, but there is a ppa out there someone's watching
[00:17] <grid_> if a profile path has been set to /home/samba/profiles how could a profile be stored at /home/<username>/profile? because this path i wanna change instead
[00:18] <Praxi> Sean, speaking from windows world, most torrent clients will verify the file before downloading more pieces of it
[00:18] <null__> what is a ppa?
[00:18] <gasull> Sean93: also, to continue a download from the command line:  wget -c http://example.com/foo/bar
[00:18] <erUSUL> sympt0m: ifconfig displays that
[00:18] <erUSUL> sympt0m: also <unconvertable> ip a <unconvertable>
[00:19] <Sean93> switch10_: that just downloads i file called "download_63072.shtml" not the file i want
[00:19] <sympt0m> erUSUL, ip a? how would the command look?
[00:19] <Praxi> anyone ever installed Ruby on Rails in Unbuntu Server 10.04?
[00:19] <erUSUL> sympt0m: well for gateaway you need <unconvertable> route -n <unconvertable> or <unconvertable> ip route <unconvertable>
[00:19] <colin__> I am looking to remove a program named Better Privacy that I downloaded recently.  Where do I go to find this program and remove it?

[00:20] <ariel_g> i've added a dns entry and i can ping it from everywhere except the machine it's pointing to...what the hell could be going on?
[00:20] <Praxi> Gasull, hes downloading a torrent, he needs to reset the torrent in his torrent client I think
[00:20] <Praxi> or force a check
[00:20] <sympt0m> thanks erUSUL
[00:20] <gasull> Sean93: I don't know the URL.  The command is  wget -c http://...
[00:20] <velko> colin__, this is a browser add on. go to "tools -> add ons" in the firefox menu
[00:20] <switch10_> Sean93: you need to give us the exact url.  I gave you the command to download the file the url you gave us pointed to
[00:20] <gasull> Sean93: you should know the URL you're downloading from
[00:20] <Praxi> that download will only get him the .torrent file itself I assume
[00:21] <Sean93>  http://www.gamershell.com/download_63072.shtml.
[00:21] <etheretic1> goltoof: no difference with smplayer.
[00:21] <Sean93> look on there
[00:21] <goltoof> gasull, that will only download the .shtml file of that page
[00:21] <Sean93> i have tried but i cant get wget to work
[00:21] <colin__> thanks velko - i found it
[00:22] <switch10_> Sean93: install the program links2 and browse to that url and try downloading it that way.
[00:22] <gasull> goltoof: as I said, Sean93 should know the exact URL
[00:22] <Aemaeth> SpeedDaemon, deb http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/ stable non-free  like this
[00:22] <Praxi> Sean93: if your trying to do a torrent.....
[00:22] <goltoof> etheretic1,   too bad.  i've had better luck playing mkv with smplayer than others.  must be a codec pack out there, or try converting mkv to another format
[00:22] <etheretic1> goltoof: aye.
[00:23] <goltoof> gasull,   even still, that's only downloading the torrent file
[00:23] <Sean93> gasull: i can't find the url, why don't you find it for me if its so easy?
[00:23] <ka1ser> nobody said it was easy
[00:23] <uRock> Silly Question #78: Does Ubuntu have the ability to log into a network utilizing Active Registry?
[00:23] <Sean93> nobody said it would be this hard lol
[00:23] <ka1ser> specially if it doesn't exist
[00:23] <gasull> goltoof, Sean93: doesn't that page offer torrent downloading as well as direct downloading? If not, forget the wget command
[00:23] <s0dium> does anyone know how to make the text size smaller in empathy on ubuntu 10.10 please?

[00:24] <Sean93> gasull: yes it does, but the torrent freezes transmission and rtorrent
[00:24] <Praxi> THAT gets you a .torrent file
[00:24] <zanus> alright seth_g  I've successfully got both my monitors working... although for some reason, the second monitor is identified as 3 instead of 2.. nevertheless it works.

Also, my AWS Navigator shows on the new monitor now instead of my default one

[00:24] <goltoof> Sean93,   are other torrents freezing TX ?
[00:25] <Sean93> goltoof: no
[00:25] <Praxi> There was no direct download on that page I saw gasull , but I didn't look real hard, just the torrent link hehe
[00:26] <Sean93> ls
[00:26] <gasull> Praxi, Sean93: then my advice is to install deluge  (sudo apt-get install deluge)  and use deluge with that torrent
[00:26] <goltoof> Sean93,   do you see where the partial file is downloaded?
[00:27] <Sean93> gasull: i tried deluge but the torrent wouldn't start. i just sat at checking 0.0%
[00:27] <mcurran> anyone know how to create a folder that points to '/'
[00:27] <Sean93> goltoof: yes

[00:27] <Caleb1134> What is the name for CUPs? apt-get cant find cupsys
[00:27] <fennecfox_> Hello, Here is my problem helpers:  I have downloaded ubuntu 10.10 3 times and burned it 3 times and every time I try to install my partition with windows, well the in the live cd gparted won't start.  Also there are problems with installing partitions if I skip looking at Gparted.
[00:27] <Aemaeth> !cups | Caleb1134
[00:27] <ubottu> Caleb1134: Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[00:28] <goltoof> Sean93,  if you try resuming the torrent in another client then it should resume the download.  If the torrent keeps freezing your client it may be a corrupted .torrent,   in which case try finding another
[00:28] <Caleb1134> Aemaeth I already read all that
[00:28] <gasull> Sean93: maybe there are no seeders for the torrent?
[00:28] <velko> anon33__, can't you just log out? and if you are automatically logged in again - to disable the automatic log in before logging out? on the gdm login screen you'll be able to change your session again
[00:28] <Praxi> !ruby
[00:28] <switch10_> Sean93: use rtorrent to download that file if you want to see what the problem is.  another gui will just freeze
[00:28] <goltoof> gasull,   pretty sure that wouldn't freeze the client... it just won't download
[00:28] <anon33__> velko: when i boot up, i'm automatically logged in with a black screen. how might i log out of that?
[00:28] <Caleb1134> Aemaeth: It didnt help at all. I found the drivers, but it wont do anything without cups and none of those links help with that
[00:28] <Praxi> was worth a try lol
[00:29] <Sean93> switch10_: it freezes rtorrent aswell
[00:29] <anon33__> velko: i can't see anything to disable the automatic login once i'm logged in..
[00:29] <PaulB_> hey there, just wondering if there is a log for the cron
[00:29] <switch10_> Sean93: something is wrong on there end
[00:29] <switch10_> Sean93: what errors?
[00:29] <PaulB_> one of my crons isnt working
[00:29] <Aemaeth> sudo apt-get cups is the common unix printing system server;  apt-cache search cups | more  <--this will show you almost anything related to cups
[00:29] <Sean93> no errors just completly freezes then i have to kill it and it turns to a zombie process, then i have to reboot
[00:30] <Sean93> how do i resume the direct download?
[00:30] <velko> anon33__, you may disable the automatic login by manually editing the file /etc/gdm3/daemon.conf (provided you can switch to a virtual terminal or ssh to the machine)
[00:30] <goltoof> Sean93, which are you doing .torrent or direct download?   big difference
[00:30] <gasull> Sean93: remove rtorrent or whatever you have from your system, install deluge, download
[00:30] <Caleb1134> Thanks for the help aemaeth, that looks like its working. Scored a couple free laser printers from work and putting them to good use
[00:30] <anon33__> velko: and what variables might i need to change in that file?
[00:31] <Praxi> Anyone ever installed Snorby?
[00:31] <Sean93> goltoof: i have tried both but i would like to finish the download by direct download
[00:31] <goltoof> velko, he should be able to do it from recovery mode?
[00:31] <hugleo> what is pidgin version from ubuntu 10.10?
[00:31] <velko> anon33__, AutomaticLoginEnable=true
[00:31] <anon33__> velko: i can boot into recovery and edit that file if it will cancel automatic login
[00:31] <urthmover> is it possible to associate a hostname and port to a friendly name ?
[00:31] <anon33__> velko: change to false?
[00:31] <velko> anon33__, yes
[00:32] <message144> Is there a way to disable the transparent terminal in the Ubuntu Dust GTK theme?
[00:32] <anon33__> velko: i'll give it a shot - thank you!
[00:32] <Praxi> Sean93: have to use a different site for direct download, that one you linked only offers torrent
[00:32] <velko> goltoof, i don't know. i don't use ubuntu
[00:32] <urthmover> for example I want m6300 to go to urthmover.ath.cx:22 and freenas to go to urthmover.ath.cx:2222
[00:32] <urthmover> thoughts?
[00:32] <Sean93> Praxi: there are direct download links on it aswell
[00:32] <gasull> Sean93: do you understand the difference between direct download and bittorrent?  In the page you posted there are several links to direct download from different servers, as well as the torrent download
[00:32] <clao> hi, i installed entrance, and when it configures i choose it a display manager instead of gdm. till, gdm keeps running. how do i disable gdm.? btw, im using gdm2

[00:33] <switch10_> Nattgew: it doesnt convert them by default?
[00:33] <gasull> Sean93: OK.  So if you want to do it with the torrent, first remove rtorrent from your system or whatever the program you were using
[00:33] <switch10_> Nattgew: It should convert them to mp3

[00:34] <Boris> Balls
[00:34] <gasull> Sean93: ok
[00:35] <Nattgew> switch10_ - i know it should, but it was giving an error "None of the tracks to be transferred are in a format supported by the target device, and no encoders are available for the supported formats."
[00:35] <Nattgew> but suddenly it works now
[00:35] <gasull> Sean93: Praxi suggest you do it with direct download using wget.  The command will be:  wget -c http://www.gamershell.com/download.html?id=63072&mirror=100tb-1&cat=demo&filename=Aion2.0.0.2_FullInstaller.zip&ts=1288136010&auth=03m8mtu1  But it's 13GB, so I suggest you use bittorrent.
[00:36] <Praxi> that one won't work gasull, it makes a key, the key gets expired
[00:36] <Praxi> he has to do it himself, and copy the link address
[00:37] <Praxi> has one of those wait for 20 seconds then you can download type things
[00:37] <Smittie3900w> gaulle: sean93 is still rebooting I think
[00:37] <gasull> Praxi: OK.  Anyway I don't think he read the last thing I said b/c he left the room :)
[00:37] <Praxi> hehe ya, not sure why he thinks a direct download will work if he can't torrent it :)
[00:37] <gasull> Praxi, Smittie3900w: yes, Sean93 might be still rebooting
[00:38] <Praxi> its a windows program, not sure why hes even bothering trying to dl it on a nix box

[00:44] <CajunTechie> Hey everyone, I have a quick question: I've recently started developing my first package on Ubuntu. Is it guaranteed to work on most other distros or will I need to tailor to each?
[00:44] <Nattgew> for the unity environment, is there a shortcut key for the upper left ubuntu button?
[00:44] <TeruFSX> gasull install the wine-1.2 package after you uninstall wine
[00:44] <gasull> Sean93: you know the program/game you're downloading is for Windows, right?  How do you plan to run it?
[00:44] <gasull> TeruFSX: thanks.  let's see
[00:45] <Sean93> gasull: wine
[00:45] <Some_Person> Anyone else having issues with (G?)Nibbles?
[00:46] <velko> CajunTechie, which other distros you have in mind? it won't work on any rpm distro. and (depending on the package dependencies) will most probably not work on debian and derivatives. if you mind ubuntu derivatives - it will most probably work
[00:46] <Sean93> gasull: also, although apt-get says transmission isnt installed it is, how do i remove it?
[00:46] <gasull> Sean93: search at http://www.winehq.org/search if you can actually run it on wine
[00:46] <Sean93> gasull:  i already checked :L
[00:47] <gasull> Sean93:  if it isn't installed, you don't have to remove it
[00:47] <Sean93> :P*
[00:47] <gasull> Sean93: cool.  now then install deluge :   sudo apt-get install deluge
[00:47] <Sean93> gasull: it is installed though, i can still run it
=== Out`Of`Control is now known as Viper
[00:47] <CajunTechie> velko: Hmmm...so even creating a metapackage for the other distros won't make it work then? I was thinking RHEL, Fedora, and maybe OpenSUSE
[00:47] <Praxi> just install deluge likes hes said quite often now? :)
[00:47] <gasull> Sean93: close transmission.  if it's uninstalled you won't be able to run it again
[00:48] <sympt0m> does anyone have any experience with the application "ettercap"?
[00:48] <velko> CajunTechie, what kind of package do you create? a deb archive or some gzipped/bzipped source code package? maybe the misunderstanding is on my side...
[00:48] <Sean93> gasull: i just did run it again
[00:48] <fennecfox_> nattgew I am starting gparted from the livecd, it looks like its starting then stops and dissapears. thanks any suggestions?
[00:49] <Praxi> hmm if i do a gem -v says 1.3.7
[00:49] <Nattgew> fennecfox_ - try running it from a terminal and seeing if it gives any errors
[00:49] <gasull> TeruFSX: Thanks.  I was able to downgrade Wine with your help :)

[00:49] <CajunTechie> velko: Sorry, got my terms mixed. I'm basically creating software but I've not packaged it yet. I'm open to creating different packages for different distros. Right now, I'm looking @ debs but it looks like I might have to create individual packages?
[00:49] <gasull> Sean93: sudo apt-get remove --purge transmission
[00:50] <sympt0m> does anyone have any experience with the application "ettercap"?
[00:50] <velko> CajunTechie, yes you'll have ot
[00:50] <velko> CajunTechie, to*
[00:50] <Sean93> Package transmission is not installed, so not removed
[00:50] <gasull> sympt0m:  just a bit.  Fire your question
[00:50] <CajunTechie> velko: Thank you.  That's kind of what I thought but was hoping to avoid. Oh well, not too tough I take it right?
[00:50] <sympt0m> query gasull
[00:50] <gasull> Sean93: sudo apt-get remove --purge transmission-common
[00:50] <sympt0m> oops
[00:51] <StaticShock> i forget, how do i sudo from gnome-do?
[00:51] <Nattgew> what package is needed for rhythmbox to transcode ogg to mp3 for an ipod?
[00:52] <Sean93> ok, that removed it. incase i want to install it again do i use apt-get install transmission-common?
[00:52] <StaticShock> anyone?
[00:52] <velko> CajunTechie, package creation is not hard. what can be tricky are the dependencies. if the libraries you use are not present trough the official distro channel/repsitory - you have to package them as well. or if they are present but under different names in the different distros - you have to tweak your package also...
[00:53] <Nattgew> StaticShock - gksu
[00:53] <CajunTechie> velko: Yuck. Oh well, I might focus only on Ubuntu for a bit then move to other platforms as I go. Eventually, I want to support the four I mentioned but Ubuntu is primary right now.
[00:53] <Sean93> gasull: ok, that removed it. incase i want to install it again do i use apt-get install transmission-common?
[00:54] <gasull> yes
[00:54] <gasull> SEan93: yes
[00:54] <gasull> Sean93:  deluge is installed, right?
[00:55] <Sean93> gasull: yes i just installed it and it is checking the file now
[00:55] <velko> CajunTechie, it is possible that you'll get help from volunteers for the packages. just concentrate on your software, the other stuff is easier ;) good luck!
[00:55] <gasull> Sean93: if not, install it.  Afterwords you should be able to download the torrent with deluge from Firefox.  Try it

[00:58] <sammy> anyone using x11vnc? it seems determined to deny my LAN client no matter what I try. using -listen and -allow with explicit addresses
[00:58] <noob42> me, locally
[00:59] <noob42> i right clicked on my folder and hit share
[00:59] <noob42> but I dont know how to access it from another computer
[01:00] <sammy> in another windows computer, it should show up in your workgroup, or however windows does it these days. on a mac, you should be able to browse to it as well in finder
[01:00] <bobfcincinnati> Hey guys probably a dumb question. I'm running Lucid with compiz and I'd like to get my "windows key+d"  combo to pop me to the desktop (like in windows) anyone know if this is possible. I looked through a bunch of options screens but couldn't find anything
[01:00] <gasull> Chell: try this:  sudo select-editor
[01:00] <noob42> im using maverick for both comps
[01:01] <noob42> :'(
[01:02] <noob42> Hi
[01:02] <Muscovy> I'm having a real issue with bug 665947 ("open with" options not saving). Could anyone assist?
[01:02] <Muscovy> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/665947
[01:02] <sammy> bobfcincinnati: check out compizconfig-settings-manager - you should be able to set your keyboard shortcuts in there
[01:03] <electrofreak> my login window is not showing on my primary monitor.
[01:03] <sammy> bobfcincinnati: just be careful if you change your compiz settings somewhere else, you could overwrite your key shortcut.
[01:04] <Chell> gasull, It doesn't seem to work (maybe just on maverick?). After altering it, when I do select-editor again, it says the default (nano? I never selected that) is unchanged.
[01:05] <bobfcincinnati> sammy: got it thanks, the default was ctrl+alt+d
[01:05] <bobfcincinnati> sammy: which would have been i suppose if I had known what it was :P
[01:06] <noob42> I have recently installed two copies of ubuntu, one on my laptop and one on my desktop. I would like to access the files on my laptop from my desktop. They are both on the same network and I attempted to share a folder using the sharing options dialogue box. I don't know how to get to those files on my desktop.
[01:06] <gasull> Chell: I think it depends on the filetype.  right-click on a file you want to open with GVim, then choose what program to open it with -> GVim
[01:06] <sammy> bobfcincinnati: there  might be somewhere else to change the very basic ones, a gnome control panel somewhere. I just know compizconfig-settings-manager has shortcuts for *everything*
[01:06] <sammy> " denying client: 192.168.0.65 does not match 192.168.0.65" this has to be one of my favorite error messages ever. I'm stumped.
[01:06] <electrofreak> my login window is not showing on my primary display. does anyone have any ideas how to fix this. It seems to plain and simply go to the secondary display and I can't figure out how to change that
[01:07] <bobfcincinnati> sammy: yea I figured it was a gnome setting, but there it was in compiz
[01:07] <sammy> electrofreak: can you set the primary monitor in the monitor settings panel? the one that lets you change resolutions and arrange multiple monitors
[01:08] <Nattgew> my wireless won't connect anymore, and gives the error in syslog "Association request to the driver failed" anyone know how to fix it?
[01:08] <noob42> I have recently installed two copies of ubuntu, one on my laptop and one on my desktop. I would like to access the files on my laptop from my desktop. They are both on the same network and I attempted to share a folder using the sharing options dialogue box. I don't know how to get to those files on my desktop.
[01:09] <Sean93> gasull: the torrent download 1.2MB of data and then went to 0.0 KiB/s and has stayed there, what should i do?
[01:09] <electrofreak> sammy, I have the nvidia drivers, so using the nvidia program... yes, I set my left as my primary. my console seem to obey that, and so does gnome. But my login window is on the right monitor for some reason
[01:10] <sammy> electrofreak: check out this bug: 395314 on launchpad
[01:10] <noob42> I have recently installed two copies of ubuntu, one on my laptop and one on my desktop. I would like to access the files on my laptop from my desktop. They are both on the same network and I attempted to share a folder using the sharing options dialogue box. I don't know how to get to those files on my desktop.
[01:10] <Aemaeth> Sean93, if you haven't port forwarded the ports your using for your torrent, your router could be refusing all incoming connections, which could be a problem
[01:10] <h00k> noob42: You could use Ubuntu One for that
[01:10] <joshyyz> Hello! does anyone have a Nokia N900?
[01:11] <sammy> I'm not sure if its the same gdm version but there's a few workarounds suggested
[01:11] <UnholyTerror> noob42, what have you tried?
[01:11] <Sean93> Aemaeth: i did forward them but ill go check to make sure
[01:11] <Aemaeth> Sean93, if you're using deluge it will say on the bottom how it's doing with the network
[01:11] <noob42> Right clicking and enabling sharing options on the file i wanted to share
[01:11] <electrofreak> sammy, thanks. I'lll take a look at it
[01:11] <Aemaeth> so if you don't see a warning then that should be fine and you have some other problem, me guesses
[01:11] <Sean93> Aemaeth: where does it say that?
[01:12] <UnholyTerror> how about the folder instead?
[01:12] <sammy> noob42: have you found where you can browse the network in the file manager?
[01:12] <Chell> gasull, no, it doesn't. Not even after a save/exit. I'm opening thesame file.
[01:13] <sammy> it should be one of the options under places in the panel at the top
[01:13] <Aemaeth> Sean93, for me: when it's not properly forwarded it will be to the right of the "DHT" connections, also to the right of the speed onthe  bottom taskbar if you don't have DHT enabled.  "No incomming connections"
[01:13] <noob42> I clicked on where it said network
[01:13] <gasull> Sean93: I tried downloading your torrent and it was working for me.  I think you should do what Aamaeth says.  You might need to config your router.  You would have to do this if you were in Windows too.
[01:14] <Sean93> what port should i use?
[01:14] <newhuis> hi, my webcam isnt working with ubuntu. how can i fix that?
[01:15] <Aemaeth> noob42, this is really complicated, but if you're looking to do a ubuntu one type solution http://fak3r.com/2009/09/14/howto-build-your-own-open-source-dropbox-clone/
[01:15] <gasull> Chell: right click on the file, then Properties -> Open with -> Add -> GVim Text Editor
[01:16] <gasull> Chell: Also, right click on the file, then Properties -> Open with -> (select GVim here after having added it to the list)
[01:16] <Aemaeth> Sean93, in the torrentclient's "Network" preferences you have the option to give a range of ports, tell your router to forward that entire range.  Then hit the "Test port" button to see if you're good, if green arrow comes up you should be set as far as that, andif  you still have problems idk
[01:16] <Sean93> i tried to restart deluge to see if that would help but it wont die
[01:17] <noob42> thank you for taking the time to try and help me out, but I just need to get my files from one comp on my network to another, and since ubuntu comes with file sharing options I think I'll find a way to fix this. Also I'm a Noob
[01:17] <Sean93> Aemaeth: there is a green arrow
[01:17] <Aemaeth> Sean93, hah, mine freezes at shutdown too...
[01:17] <gasull> Sean93: I dont' know about this, sorry.  Ask Aemaeth.
[01:17] <Sean93> Aemaeth: how do i kill it?
[01:17] <gasull> Sean93: pkill deluge
[01:17] <Aemaeth> normally if i hit the close button it will give me an option to "Force Quit"
[01:18] <Sean93> gasull: that didn't kill it
[01:19] <Sean93> i killed it with kill -1 PID but now its a zombie -.-
[01:19] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> kill its parent
[01:19] <noob42> Thanks Anyway, Unholy Terror
[01:19] <gasull> Sean93: top
[01:19] <s0dium> does anyone know if it is possible to change the text size in empathy?
[01:19] <gasull> Sean93: run top and kill it with it
[01:20] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: how do i find its parent?
[01:20] <Sean93> gasull: how do i kill with top?
[01:20] <gasull> Sean93: I meant htop
[01:20] <gasull> Sean93: sudo apt-get install htop
[01:20] <cmdbbq> i have installed steam in wine, and now i am looking for the install files for steam on my hdd. they should (i would think) be under Program Files on the virtual C drive, but the only thing in there is iexplorer so steam runs with all my games and what not, but where are they?
[01:20] <Aemaeth> Sean93, or you might be more comfortable with system monitor?
[01:21] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: i suggest looking at the output of pstree -p
[01:21] <Sean93> i dont think torrents are the way to go, how do i resume that download with wget?
[01:22] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: wget -c
[01:22] <Aemaeth> cmdbbq, that's odd...there has to be a "steam" folder somewhere, have you searched your entire filesystem just in case?  mine was in /home/user/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Program\ Files/ like you would have thought yours woudl be
[01:23] <gasull> Sean93: browse that page and find the exact link of the file
[01:23] <gasull> Sean93: then use wget -c
[01:23] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: http://www.gamershell.com/download_63072.shtml here is the link with the mirrors on it. can u try to download the file with wget and then give me the link? i tried this earlier and couldnt get it to work
[01:23] <Gump> yo #ubuntu, ever since i updated to ubuntu 10.04, my sound card no longer shows up at all
[01:23] <Gump> ive been trying to fix this for months with no luck
[01:23] <newhuis> my intergrated webcam isnt recongnizedcan someone help me?
[01:24] <Gump> i stopped using linux for a while, but i really like it aside from the sound problems. anyone got any suggestions on where to start?
[01:25] <Gump> newhuis, use google. i got mine working with very little searching
[01:25] <Gump> cant remember exactly what i did though
[01:26] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: it resumes just fine with wget -c "http://www.gamershell.com/download.html?id=63072&mirror=cdn&cat=demo&filename=Aion2.0.0.2_FullInstaller.zip&ts=1288139124&auth=i2ig6xnx"
[01:26] <h00k> !google | Gump
[01:26] <ubottu> Gump: While Google is useful for helpers, many newer users don't have the google-fu yet. Please don't tell people to "google it" when they ask a question.
[01:26] <cjae> is running a gnome-terminal -e mediatomb the best way to have mediatomb start upon reboot? since it is on a wireless connection and needs to wait for authentication of login or keyring for login?
[01:27] <Gump> speaking of which, why would my sound card disappear when i updated to ubuntu 10.04?
[01:27] <cjae> or can I make the mediatomb daemon pause?
[01:27] <cjae> adding mediatomb to startup list doesnt work either
[01:27] <silent_h> Do any of you have a multi-user setup?  If so, is there a clean way to reinstall and keep both users?  I currently have /home on its own partition and when I reinstall only one account exists, then I create the other and it seems fine, but I feel like this is leaving room for error (such as if the user ID changes due to me getting the order wrong).
[01:28] <arrrghhh> cjae, isn't there already an upstart script for mediatomb?
[01:28] <arrrghhh> cjae, sudo service mediatomb stop/start/restart?
[01:28] <Gump> silent_h, is it possible to do a clean reinstall and leave the folders and files intact?
[01:28] <electrofreak> alright. SO... what hope do I have of getting Suspend or Hibernate to work on my new computer. 890FX chipset (msi board)
[01:28] <Gump> cause i might just do that, im tired of messing with this soundcard bull
[01:28] <silent_h> yeah, everything on /home stays since I only reformat the root partition
[01:28] <lucas_> plz can someone help me... I want to mount vhd and vdi disk files on my ubuntu host
[01:29] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: when i try that command it downloads a file called "download.html?id=63072&mirror=cdn&cat=demo&filename=Aion2.0.0.2_FullInstaller.zip&ts=1288139124&auth=i2ig6xnx"
[01:29] <newhuis> gump, not avail
[01:29] <Gump> silent_h, once root is reformatted, how do you reinstall ubuntu to the partition? doesnt installing ubuntu format the partition?
[01:29] <Gump> newhuis, try installing a program called "webcam studio"
[01:29] <cjae> arrrghhh: ya but wouldnt I have to issue that manually?
[01:29] <arrrghhh> electrofreak, not every mobo supports it in linux... or perhaps not all mobos are supported by linux.  either way you want to look at it.
[01:29] <EeveeTrainer> hi does anyone know how i can install Qt4 on ubuntu
[01:30] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> yeah but it's the file nevertheless, you can check with "file download.htm....." and see that it's a tar.gz archive
[01:30] <arrrghhh> cjae, yes, but if the service is in rc.X, it'll start automatically unless you're doing something odd with runlevels.
[01:30] <silent_h> Gump, I have multiple partitions set up.  / is mounted separately from /home - so when I reinstall, I only have it reformat my "/" (root) partition.  I then tell it to mount /home on the same partition I used to have it on
[01:30] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> zip archive, i mean
[01:30] <arrrghhh> EeveeTrainer, i know kde uses it... what are you needing just qt for?
[01:30] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: just rename after download. The webste is messing up the filename for it
[01:30] <Gump> oh. well damnit. guess i'm gonna have to reformat the whole partition then
[01:30] <jb0> Im looking to override the gnome url handler for ssh:// (by default it mount gvfs), I tried overriding it with gconftool, but that didn't work. Is there a place i can track down how gnome is handling this url scheme?
[01:30] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: you could also try and find another location of that file
[01:30] <silent_h> Gump, if you don't have multiple partitions set up already, you could copy everything from your /home directory to a backup drive and use that after you reinstall
[01:30] <Gump> i am gonna turn off ubuntu automatic updates for ever. CURSE AUTOMATIC UPDATES
[01:30] <electrofreak> arrrghhh, yes, I do want to look at it. I'd love to get it to work. Any tips on where I could start to troubleshoot the reason. I have an adaptec RAID card... which I had fears about it causing problems for sleep states. But I'm not sure if that is my problem here or not.
[01:31] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: the file should be 13.2GB, i have already downloaded 9.2GB of the file
[01:31] <Gump> silent_h, thanks
[01:31] <EeveeTrainer> i need qt for a program i'm running !
[01:31] <silent_h> so when you reinstall, you can set up multiple partitions to make it easier for next time
[01:31] <cjae> arrrghhh: so I have to add that to rc.X?
[01:31] <arrrghhh> electrofreak, this is a desktop?  not sure then.  it works fine on my laptop.
[01:31] <silent_h> Gump, want a link to a guide on how to do that, or are you good to go?
[01:31] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: ok, if you have the space available, i would suggest to copy those 9.2 GB somewhere, just in case the wget messes up and you end up with an empty download.
[01:31] <Gump> i already have my disk partitioned into a windows partition and a linux one. never thought of spreading my linux install over multiple partitions
[01:31] <arrrghhh> cjae, no i'm saying if it's already there, mediatomb should start automatically.  let's start with square one - do you have an /etct/init.d/mediatomb script?
[01:31] <Gump> silent_h, i would like a link if youve got one handy
[01:31] <silent_h> I can find one here...
[01:31] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: http://aionirc.com/ncpatch/ here i'm also seeing that file
[01:32] <lucas_> plz can someone help me... I want to mount vhd and vdi disk files on my ubuntu host
[01:32] <bastidrazor> http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome    Gump
[01:32] <electrofreak> arrrghhh, yes, it's a desktop. I'm aware that linux + suspending/hibernating is very spottily supported... but I'm hopeful I could get such working.
[01:32] <Gump> thank you bastidrazor
[01:32] <bastidrazor> Gump: you're welcome
[01:32] <arrrghhh> electrofreak, well not having your hardware makes it difficult for me to troubleshoot.  did you find anyone else in a search that's using that same board?
[01:33] <arrrghhh> electrofreak, unfortunately not many people use suspend/hibernate on desktops methinks.
[01:33] <cjae> arrrghhh: yes cated it and seems to be there
[01:33] <electrofreak> arrrghhh, what search? I'm asking for starting points to troubleshoot and maybe figure out how to get it working?
[01:33] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: alright i will try that one when it finishes copying, thanks
[01:33] <newhuis> gump, why?
[01:33] <silent_h> Gump, his link was better than what I could quickly find.  For what it's worth, here's how much space I gave my partitions:
[01:34] <arrrghhh> cjae, it should start on boot then.... does it not?
[01:34] <electrofreak> arrrghhh, alright, I'll spend more time on google. Thanks :-)
[01:34] <cjae> arrrghhh: no it doesnt, someone told me there is an issue with it and ubuntu
[01:34] <Gump> ubuntu 10.10 isnt only 64bit is it?
[01:34] <arrrghhh> electrofreak, oh, i figured you would've tried to find someone else online that had the same hw... anyhoo, dmesg, syslog and /var/log/messages are good places for indicators...
[01:34] <EeveeTrainer> how can i shut down ubuntu --immediately--?
[01:34] <silent_h> "/boot"  200mb
[01:34] <silent_h> "/" 15GB
[01:34] <silent_h> swap  4gb
[01:34] <silent_h> "/home" 300gb (or however much space you have left)
[01:34] <FloodBot1> silent_h: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[01:35] <cjae> arrrghhh: works just fine if I launch it via cli upon reboot
[01:35] <arrrghhh> cjae, oh?  i prefer ps3mediaserver.  what are you streaming to?
[01:35] <littlebearz> EeveeTrainer: sudo shutdown -h now
[01:35] <silent_h> Gump, 10.10 is either 32 or 64 bit
[01:35] <Chell> gasull, That did the trick! thanks (sry for late reply)
[01:35] <cjae> arrrghhh: ps3
[01:35] <Gump> jesus silent_h. my whole hard disk is only like 200gb
[01:35] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: wget -c -O "filename" <url> to tell wget to which file it should continue downloading
[01:35] <EeveeTrainer> littlebearz: what is -h ?
[01:35] <silent_h> disk space is cheap ;)
[01:35] <Gump> thoughts on 10.10 vs 10.04 anyone?
[01:35] <arrrghhh> cjae, you NEED to check out ps3mediaserver then my friend.  WAY batter than mediatomb.
[01:35] <bastidrazor> EeveeTrainer: read the man page for shutdown .. type man shutdown
[01:35] <qorep> in 10.10 nautilus I can no longer use ~/path in ^l  it gives me "currentdir/~/path not found"
[01:35] <silent_h> 10.10 seems pretty solid, but I'm still on 10.04 till later this week
[01:35] <qorep> >.<
[01:36] <cjae> arrrghhh: I just am not sure if its my setup or if its an actual bug or something
[01:36] <Gump> meh. 10.10 it is.
[01:36] <silent_h> doit
[01:36] <newhuis> my intergrated webcam isnt recongnized on ubuntu. can someone help me?
[01:36] <arrrghhh> cjae, seriously.  unless mediatomb has made great strides recently, i would ditch it.
[01:37] <bruceber> having problems with network startup since upgrade to 10.10.  Primary wired interface never comes up. If I manually run dhclient, everything's ok.  Any ideas?
[01:37] <Gump> newhuis, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam derp?
[01:37] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: what is the -O for?
[01:37] <Gump> how new to ubuntu are you newhuis? have you already tried some things?
[01:37] <obengdako> EeveeTrainer, even a faster way is sudo init 0 but just make sure you've saved everything, although this is not the recommended way to shutdown but this really does the job!
[01:38] <lucas_> plz can someone help me... I want to mount vhd and vdi disk files on my ubuntu host
[01:38] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: to tell wget what filename it should save the file to
[01:38] <silent_h> Gump, ubuntu's help has a guide on partitioning too (on help.ubuntu.com)
[01:38] <cjae> arrrghhh: I should be able to have both installed so I can see without conflict correct? and I suppose since it is geared towards ps3 then I should not have it edit much like I do to transcode for ps3
[01:38] <Quantum_Ion> try using lftp see if it works for you
[01:38] <silent_h> in case you wanted even more info
[01:38] <Gump> i know how to partition. my disk is already partitioned. i just didnt think about putting home in a separate partition
[01:38] <arrrghhh> bruceber, huh that's an odd one.  anything stick out in /var/log/messages when you boot?
[01:39] <Gump> the main thing is my freaking sound card disappeared. but oh well, i'll just nuke my current install
[01:39] <arrrghhh> cjae, does it all oob.  i think you'll be shocked how much easier it is to setup compared to mediatomb.
[01:39] <silent_h> got ya
[01:39] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: do i put in the location of the file or just the name?
[01:39] <newhuis> Gump, theres nothing about integrated cams
[01:39] <bruceber> arrrghhh: not really...  everything looks fine.  drivers properly registered, etc...
[01:39] <silent_h> really the only tough decision is how much space to put in each partition so that's why I thought you might want lots of info
[01:40] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: if you just enter the filename (without path) then it will be stored in your current directory
[01:40] <arrrghhh> bruceber, i don't use dhcp on my server... is there an upstart script for it?
[01:40] <Gump> newhuis, ...its a webcam. look up if there are drivers for it on your computer manufacturers website
[01:40] <cjae> arrrghhh: in repos?
[01:40] <Sean93> so if im in the directory of the file i just need the filename?
[01:40] <newhuis> Gump, you think i didnt do that already? this is my last resort
[01:40] <arrrghhh> cjae, i believe it is now.  i have a repo that's has the newest bleeding edge version, but i recommend sticking to the stable version to start with.
[01:40] <Gump> newhuis, thats why i asked "have you tried anything yet?"
[01:41] <bruceber> arrrghhh: there's nothing in /etc/init.d , though I'd assume that it's supposed to be run when /etc/init.d/networking runs
[01:41] <cjae> arrrghhh: dont see it on 10.10
[01:41] <arrrghhh> cjae, yea it may not be in the repo's yet.  1 sec.
[01:41] <cjae> arrrghhh: sorry 10.04
[01:41] <Gump> iirc you need to set up a vloopback device or something like that
[01:42] <Jygga> uhm, i am currently rm'ing 140GiB logfiles. Will take about 7 minutes, guess i shouldve just unlinked?
[01:42] <arrrghhh> cjae, this will install everything for you - wget -q --no-check-certificate https://svn.paissad.net/misc/stuffs/install_pms-linux.sh -O - | bash
[01:42] <gasull> Chell: np
[01:43] <cjae> arrrghhh: ok thanks
[01:43] <anon33_> velko: i got it to work :D thanks so much for your help. it ended up being /etc/gdm/custom.conf
[01:43] <Renderspec> Is it possible to upgrade the kernel to have support for "--cmd-owner" in iptables?
[01:43] <Gump> oh god i hate fresh OS installs
[01:43] <silent_h> hehe they are always a bit nerve-wracking
[01:43] <silent_h> just make sure you have a good backup though and worst case is you lose some free time
[01:44] <Gump> my next few hours are gonna be filled with sudo apt-gets :(
[01:44] <silent_h> also, I find it handy to keep a list of all applications I end up installing so that after a new one I get on google docs and copy-paste one big-ol sudo apt-get
[01:44] <littlebearz> Gump: what happend to aptitude
[01:44] <silent_h> aptitude still exists too, but we have choice here ;)
[01:45] <Jygga> there are about 32 GiB that i cannot locate with du on this server
[01:45] <Gump> lol i just like using the terminal. no reason in particular
[01:45] <Jygga> du is giving me du: cannot access `proc/12357/fd/4' tho
[01:46] <arrrghhh> i like aptitude better, i haven't had as many issues removing applications with it.  but there's some things that must be fixed with apt-get.  couldn't imagine trying to use just apt lol
[01:46] <rooks> how to tell mplayer to exit on buffer underrun?
[01:46] <arrrghhh> Jygga, /proc is a virtual filesystem.
[01:46] <Gump> fffff.... i hate mplayer
[01:46] <Jygga> yes
[01:46] <Jygga> but why would there be 32 GiB in there?
[01:47] <Gump> has anyone had any success running divx player on ubuntu instead of mplayer for divx movies?
[01:47] <TeruFSX> Jygga: it's probably basically a placeholder value
[01:47] <arrrghhh> Jygga, it doesn't.
[01:47] <Gump> mplayer is incapable of streaming divx, it seems. and vlc player is just as bad
[01:48] <arrrghhh> vlc works for me.  i do most of my media viewing thru mah ps3 tho.
[01:48] <rooks> Gump, how to tell vlc to exit on buffer underrun?
[01:48] <cjae> arrrghhh: says I have to install someting else first
[01:48] <Gump> vlc player gets to a point where it starts buffering and the video just suddenly ends for me. highly frustrating
[01:49] <Jygga> uhm okay
[01:49] <cjae> arrrghhh: dpkg-dev
[01:49] <arrrghhh> cjae, huh that script should've done all of it for ya.  what is it asking to install?  i've never heard of dkpg-dev... can you install that?
[01:49] <TeruFSX> Gump do you have the GStreamer ffmpeg video plugin installed?
=== slicer_ is now known as s|icer
[01:50] <EeveeTrainer> sorry, what is the fastest way to shut down ubuntu
[01:50] <TeruFSX> if you don't know, open Software Center, search for it, and install it if it isn't install
[01:50] <happyface> when I maximize a window in 10.10 it covers the top and bottom gnome toolbars. how do I disable that?
[01:50] <TeruFSX> EeveeTrainer the power icon in the upper-right corner
[01:50] <TeruFSX> it opens a menu
[01:50] <Gump> TeruFSX, im doing a fresh install but i will be sure to install it. thanks
[01:51] <Gump> yep, i have it installed
[01:52] <TeruFSX> odd
[01:53] <cjae> arrrghhh: I trust that is a reliable source?
[01:54] <arrrghhh> indeed, see this post

[01:55] <TeruFSX> JohnTeddy I do not know
[01:55] <TeruFSX> try it!
[01:57] <cjae> arrrghhh: bunch of stuff didnt install :(
[01:58] <arrrghhh> cjae, hmmm... that's unfortunate.  i've never used the automatic script.  what failed?
[01:59] <YeTr2> So, when will ubuntu installer stop failing on LVM and proxy support?
[01:59] <cjae> arrrghhh: trying to install what failed
[02:00] <arrrghhh> cjae, ok.  sorry... i usually just add the repo, get the gpg key and install pms-linux...
[02:00] <seth_g> My issue is SOLVED. Card AND internal gfx show up in lspci now...   SHORT ANSWER FOR SOME: If you have an asus board DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy anything with an nvidia chip. Done...
[02:00] <MarathonDove> How do I auto-identify in Smuxi IRC client?
[02:00] <cjae> arrrghhh: not trying to be rude but this doesnt seem much easier, hope pms is substantially better
[02:01] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: is used  wget -c -O "Aion2.0.0.2_FullInstaller.zip" http://aionirc.com/ncpatch/Aion2.0.0.2_FullInstaller.zip but it doesn't seem to be downloading, the curser is just blinking
[02:01] <seth_g> so no nvidia video cards unless your asus mb is nvidia too
[02:01] <arrrghhh> cjae, lol i wasn't referring to the installation process unfortunately... and i thought it was in the repo's, just an old version...
[02:01] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: let me give it a try
[02:02] <momentum> i have a usb drive; on which I stored my ssh keys for backup; now, how do I overwrite the data on the usb drive?
[02:02] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: works here.
[02:02] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: what is supposed to happen?
[02:02] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: and should i be sudo?

[02:03] <Dice-Man> --
[02:03] <Draqul> Lol, freenode is closing.
[02:03] <BinaryCortex> has anyone else seen where it says the install failed on everything you try to install from the software center
[02:03] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: how should i fix it?
[02:04] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: did you not accidentally forgot a " at the end of the url?
[02:04] <seth_g> isnt freenode closing like closing the internet??
[02:04] <Sean93> wget -c -O "Aion2.0.0.2_FullInstaller.zip" http://aionirc.com/ncpatch/Aion2.0.0.2_FullInstaller.zip
[02:04] <YeTr2> Draqul: don't feed the trolls
[02:04] <Sean93> that is the exact command i used
[02:04] <seth_g> or rather closing freenode requires the internet to be closed first
[02:04] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> the interwebs shuts down?
[02:04] <YeTr2> seth_g: don't feed the trolls
[02:04] <avo> hey guys, so when you're writing python for linux, you need the #! at the top. (Well not need, but you know what I mean). Generally, it's #!/usr/bin/python. But I also see (and works equally well in my experience), #!/usr/bin/env python. What is the difference, if any, and why would I chose one over the other? thanks!
[02:04] <Draqul> YeTr2: I am not. I know freenode is not closing.
[02:04] <BinaryCortex> any thoughts on everything saying the install failed even if it works?
[02:05] <Steven_Krebs> the command is fine it's just the servers not responding
[02:05] <seth_g> YeTr2, i literally didnt know it was a troll i was worried for a sec
[02:05] <YeTr2> Draqul: not so intelligent people might think otherwise.
[02:05] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> Sean93: can you test if you can download that file in a browser? just to see that your internet connection is in order
[02:05] <Cmdr_W_T_Riker> or are you downloading it remotely
[02:05] <Draqul> YeTr2: Aren't we here to deal with their issues? If they are concerned, let them voice it so we can quash their ignorance. Problem solved ;)
[02:06] <seth_g> YeTr2, i also think its funny that i only get replies to non-ubuntu question
[02:06] <chibihogoshino> any one having problems with sound not playing ?
[02:06] <Sean93> Cmdr_W_T_Riker: yes, i can download it in my browser
[02:06] <westmi> utube - no sound
[02:07] <westmi> amaroc ok, but no sound on utube

[02:08] <chibihogoshino> i have no sound output but i do have input ..
[02:08] <cjae> arrrghhh: another render is running on your system
[02:08] <chibihogoshino> every thing plays like its working right
[02:08] <arrrghhh> cjae, did you stop mediatomb?

[02:09] <ubottu> Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[02:09] <arrrghhh> cjae, you can have them both installed, but i don't think you can have them both running...
[02:09] <anon33_> what's the applet that allows you to shut down, hibernate, restart, etc?
[02:10] <cjae> arrrghhh: upnp media server 'mediatomb' was already stopped
[02:10] <arrrghhh> cjae, so where are you getting this error?  never seen/heard of it.

[02:12] <cjae> arrrghhh: under traces in gui
[02:12] <YeTr2> seth_g: ubuntu can handle more than two cards at the same time, as ubuntu uses Xorg. It's just ubuntu's silly configuration utility doesn't know how to make it work. If you have two nvidia cards, and they both show up in lspci, use the nvidia-settings command to configure X from the 'nvidia-settings' package.
[02:12] <seth_g> so if you have asus mb with ati chipset and you are having trouble with nvidia cards, break all the nvidia cards in half and get ati cards...
[02:12] <seth_g> no YeTr2
[02:13] <seth_g> YeTr2, if the mb has ati chipset nvidia cards will not allow surround view
[02:13] <YeTr2> surround view?
[02:13] <seth_g> yes
[02:13] <Draqul> seth_g: Just because nvidia doesn't play as well with Linux as intel does, doesn't mean you can't get it to work.
[02:13] <YeTr2> what is surround view?
[02:13] <seth_g> as in use the video card but still enable onboard
[02:13] <anon33_> what's the name of the applet that has the dropdown menu for shut down, hibernate, etc?
[02:14] <YeTr2> that should be a bios setting to enable both.
[02:14] <Draqul> anon33_: is it not showing on your panel?
[02:14] <arrrghhh> cjae, how did you start it?
[02:14] <anon33_> Draqul: I'm trying to add it via command line
[02:14] <anon33_> i just need the name
[02:14] <cjae> arrrghhh: from menu
[02:14] <sir_tyrion> Anybody install ubuntu 10.10 on ibook g4 (ppc) or have experience with ppc?
[02:14] <cjae> arrrghhh: also will it be there upon reboot
[02:14] <seth_g> YeTr2, you are correct. that option is not available if the chipsets dont match. further, an ati chipset mb will only let one nvidia card work at a time
[02:14] <anon33_> ie - nm-applet for the wifi
[02:14] <Draqul> anon33_: I am not on Ubuntu, or even in Gnome so I am not sure. I want to say "power_applet". It's something like that.
[02:15] <arrrghhh> cjae, i believe so.  try this "sudo service pms-linux force-stop" - then try the menu icon again.
[02:15]  * Draqul is in ArchLinux running openbox
[02:15] <anon33_> it's not power-applet
[02:15] <Draqul> anon33_: Give me a minute? I'd love to look it up for you. =)
[02:15] <anon33_> Draqul: I'd greatly appreciate that (and how you looked it up for future reference :D)
[02:16] <seth_g> i had two nvidia cards and ive been pulling my hair out all week trying to get more than one graphics card to work. finally took the whole thing to the computer store and thats what they told me. asus mb with ati is not compatible with nvidia
[02:16] <baba_b00ie> what is unity ?
[02:16] <cjae> arrrghhh: does it maybe mean my wii
[02:16] <seth_g> so now i have 3 monitors working with no problem
[02:16] <arrrghhh> cjae, not sure.  your ps3 should show up in the first tab tho.
[02:16] <seth_g> YeTr2, not even an os thing
[02:17] <YeTr2> I'm going to say that your specific MB fails if the manufacturer puts such restrictions on it.
[02:17] <seth_g> after all the screwing around though i know X pretty damn well
[02:17] <chibihogoshino> meah
[02:17] <arch_is_awesome> I would like to find out how to do as show here:
[02:17] <cjae> arrrghhh: no ps3 but it is in xmb
[02:17] <arch_is_awesome> $1 = /home/user/foo.cpp
[02:17] <Draqul> anon33_: Is it "shutdown-applet" or "shutdown applet"?
[02:17] <arch_is_awesome> I want to use /home/user/foo/* in my script to copy a file to a directory in $1's parent
[02:17] <seth_g> YeTr2, i was under the assumption as are the techs that if you install a video card the internal graphics are disabled
[02:18] <starn> hello.
[02:18] <arrrghhh> cjae, hum, that's very odd.  i've been using this application for 2 years now, had very few hiccups/issues.  i've also installed it on 5 other machines of friends...
[02:18] <arch_is_awesome> I had to use an example to explain what I want
[02:18] <arch_is_awesome> I figured this would be the channel with the most people to answer. #gnu did not work
[02:18] <seth_g> you CAN turn the internal gfx on... but in this case only if you are using an ati video card. nvidia card would not allow that bios setting
[02:18] <YeTr2> seth_g: I have a machine at home that does no suchs thing. but it is an nForce chipset w/ an nvidia card
[02:18] <UnholyTerror> seth_g, I've not noticed that...
[02:18] <cjae> arrrghhh: lastest firmware on ps3 too, although I have one that isnt that I am saving lol
[02:18] <Draqul> anon33_: By the way, there's this HUGE online help document known as "Google". It's at http://www.google.com/ and all you do is type in some keywords and presto! (Please excuse the smart-aleckness, but google-fu will take you far)
[02:18] <seth_g> UnholyTerror, are you a computer tech?
[02:19] <Draqul> arch_is_awesome: Why ask here instead of #archlinux?
[02:19] <seth_g> because the 6 of them disagree with you
[02:19] <anon33_> Draqul: Well...obviously I tried that before asking the channel
[02:19] <UnholyTerror> I've had three monitors 1 with onboard intel, 1 with ati card and 1 with nvidia card all on same machine at the same time.
[02:19] <arrrghhh> cjae, hahaha my ps3 is up-to-date as well.  gotta be able to access the store :P
[02:19] <seth_g> the 6 techs insisted that if a video card is put in then the mb will always turn the internal graphics off unless you force it back on in the bios
[02:19] <arch_is_awesome> It is part of coreutils and ubuntu has that. Ubuntu has the biggest user base
[02:20] <arch_is_awesome> therefore a quicker answer
[02:20] <seth_g> UnholyTerror, there you go with 'Intel' which it is not
[02:20] <UnholyTerror> no, i am not a tech.
[02:20] <arch_is_awesome> Also I was talking to Draqul
[02:20] <Draqul> arch_is_awesome: But this chat is centered around Ubuntu support, not arch support. I am on arch as well, and if I have arch questions or concerns I go to #archlinux or ##linux. Not #ubuntu
[02:20] <seth_g> forcing the internal graphics ON when a video card is installed is called surround view
[02:21] <YeTr2> I used to speak XFree. Then I hit puberty. Now I speak Xorg.
[02:21] <arch_is_awesome> Although I think it would still work
[02:21] <seth_g> if the video card and internal graphics are not the same chipset then surround view is not available
[02:21] <arch_is_awesome> But... okay
[02:21] <seth_g> intel is good with nvidia
[02:21] <UnholyTerror> ran three separate desktops and also linked them via xinerama
[02:21] <seth_g> 'apparently'
[02:22] <arrrghhh> arch_is_awesome, c'mon man don't come in here with that handle.  at least be discreet about it :P
[02:22] <Draqul> arrrghhh: His handle is fine.
[02:22] <arrrghhh> cjae, so do you see your media at least?  i think with a default configuration it just starts you at '/'
[02:22] <arrrghhh> Draqul, i was just joking... settle down.
[02:22] <Draqul> arrrghhh, arch_is_awesome: as long as arch_is_awesome is not trolling or bashing Ubuntu, etc. he is fine here. =)
[02:22] <sympt0m> does anyone know about ettercap?
[02:23] <shingen> are all .04 versions LTS?
[02:23] <shingen> e.g., 10.04, 9.04, 8.04.... and 11.04?
[02:23] <aguitel> shingen, no
[02:23] <arch_is_awesome> Hmmm... maybe I should use a Nick that won't give away my linux usage
[02:23] <canthus13> sympt0m: A little. I used to know one of the devs.
[02:23] <arrrghhh> shingen, nope.  every 2 years.
[02:23] <aguitel> shingen, 8.04 ,10.04 12.04
[02:23] <arrrghhh> shingen, so 6.06, 8.04, 10.04
[02:23] <shingen> arrrghhh: ahh, thanks... forgot
[02:23] <shingen> unity shell in 11.04 makes sense now :)
[02:24] <canthus13> sympt0m: AFAIK, it's a dead project.  There hasn't been active development in years.
[02:24] <shingen> I asked in ubuntu+1 but they're too silent there :)
[02:25] <arrrghhh> shingen, yea with a new release +1 gets pretty quiet.  check it again in march of 2011 ;)
[02:25] <Guest73780> I just upgraded to lucid.  I'm on the wireless network, but there's no indicator anywhere saying so.  Shouldn't there be some sort of icon up on the top bar somewhere?
[02:25] <shingen> arrrghhh: who is in +2? :)
[02:25] <arrrghhh> Guest73780, yes, it should look like radar beams going upwards...?
[02:25] <Draqul> lol arrrghhh
[02:25] <arrrghhh> shingen, don't think that room exists.  kinda getting ot....
[02:25] <cjae> arrrghhh: not sure yet dont have any there will let you know
[02:26] <arrrghhh> cjae, ok.  the gui is obviously the easiest way to configure it, but there's a conf file as well - PMS.conf, if you prefer.
[02:26] <Guest73780> arrrghhh, ok, it's not there.  What's it called and how do I get it there?
[02:26] <Draqul> I wish I could set my girlfriend's PMS.conf...
[02:26] <arrrghhh> Guest73780, well it's part of nm-applet... try rebooting.
[02:27] <arrrghhh> Draqul, yea i always questioned the name of that package... pms-linux.
[02:27] <Guest73780> Draqul, dude, that's hilarious...
[02:27] <Rotham> hah
[02:27] <sympt0m> canthus13, if ettercap is dead, then what should i replace it with?
[02:27] <canthus13> It still should work fine.. at least until IPv6 makes it completely obsolete.
[02:28] <sympt0m> did you get my query?
[02:28] <canthus13> sympt0m: If I recall correctly, It was pretty stable by 0.7.3
[02:28] <arrrghhh> sympt0m, is that just a packet sniffer tool?  why not wireshark?
[02:28] <canthus13> sympt0m: Yah... I was on another screen.
[02:28] <canthus13> arrrghhh: wireshark doesn't support ARP poisoning.
[02:28] <anon33_> Dalton: Where's that solution?
[02:28] <sympt0m> used for arp poisoning, or at least, thats what i want
[02:28] <arrrghhh> canthus13, oh i see what it is.  nvm.
[02:28] <arrrghhh> sympt0m, sorry ;)
[02:28] <sympt0m> no prob arrrghhh  ;D
[02:29] <canthus13> sympt0m: I don't really remember a whole lot about using it. I haven't touched it in years. too busy doing other stuff.
[02:29] <sympt0m> is there an alternative
[02:29] <sympt0m> ?
[02:30] <canthus13> sympt0m: arppoison.
[02:30] <sympt0m> o.O
[02:30] <canthus13> it's a lot more rudimentary than ettercap, though.
[02:30] <sympt0m> ill look it up thanks canthus13
[02:30] <canthus13> it's in arp tools.
[02:31] <Sean93> how do i PM someone?
[02:31] <sympt0m> arp tools is a package on synaptics?
[02:31] <sympt0m> #/query <name>
[02:31] <canthus13> Not sure.
[02:31] <rhct> Night all :)
[02:31] <sympt0m> without #
[02:31] <YeTr2> Sean93: /query username message
[02:31] <canthus13> I use backtrack for penetration stuff.
[02:31] <arch_is_awesome> Anyway where does all the money from ubuntu one go?
[02:31] <sympt0m> i cant use backtrack on my netbook, 1024x600 doesnt work
[02:32] <arch_is_awesome> Donations? Cannocial (If so for what?)
[02:32] <arrrghhh> arch_is_awesome, canocial is a company dude...
[02:32] <arrrghhh> sorry canonical

[02:32] <LIMEWIRE> U MAD BROS?
[02:32] <arch_is_awesome> ubutnu one would go to canonical
[02:33] <canthus13> sympt0m: Cain & Abel may work under wine.. some folks have done it.
[02:33] <arch_is_awesome> Well okay bye! /part
[02:33] <sympt0m> blehhhh i dont want to mess with win
[02:33] <arrrghhh> arch_is_awesome, i'm pretty sure the ubuntu dev team has some paid developers.  and they gotta pay all those canonical employees :P
[02:33] <sympt0m> wine
[02:33] <arrrghhh> ah wel
[02:33] <pankajsmeel> hi friends
[02:33] <arrrghhh> !hi | pankajsmeel
[02:34] <canthus13> sympt0m: *shrug*  ettercap should be fine for IPv4... just don't expect bugfixes or new features... unless you do it yourself. :)
[02:34] <shingen> !hi | shingen
[02:34] <pankajsmeel> i am using ubuntu 10.10 as i heard one of my friends that ubuntu is awesome
[02:34] <arrrghhh> damnit i thought it was that.
[02:34] <sympt0m> lol
[02:34] <sympt0m> canthus13, the problem is, that i cant get the damn thing to work xD
[02:34] <arrrghhh> !hello
[02:34] <arrrghhh> wtf
[02:35] <canthus13> sympt0m: :( I wish I could help you with that, but I haven't used it in years.
[02:35] <sympt0m> canthus13, thats okay lol, thanks for the advice
[02:35] <pankajsmeel> but i have a slight problem whenever i play video in ubuntu it plays for first 2 minutes but after that all the video and audio play with jerks
[02:35] <cjae> arrrghhh: well it is not started upon reboot and now I cannot get it to connect to ps3 at all
[02:35] <pankajsmeel> can any body help me in this issue
[02:36]  * canthus13 lost track of Alor a long time ago...
[02:36] <arrrghhh> cjae, let's see if it's running.  fire up a terminal and do "sudo service pms-linux status"
[02:36] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, what type of video and what are you using to play the video?
[02:36] <Ryen> Hello, so I just upgraded my system and rebooted. Though when I try to boot into Ubuntu it goes to the login screen, but doesn't display the Login area, like where I can pick my user and type in my password. Any ideas?
[02:37] <cjae> arrrghhh: running
[02:37] <arrrghhh> cjae, hmmm but you don't see it on xmb at all?
[02:37] <Draqul> Ryen: this was an internal upgrade - ie not from a livecd?
[02:37] <cjae> arrrghhh: not upon reboot
[02:37] <pankajsmeel> i am using vlc to play the video and the file format is  .mpg,.flv
[02:37] <arrrghhh> cjae, is mediatomb also running...?  i'm not sure if they clash or not.
[02:38] <sympt0m> alright so heres a somewhat related question then: if i put my computer into ip_forward mode, do i need to put it back, or will it switch back when i clost the console?
[02:38] <pankajsmeel> any format give the same problem
[02:38] <Ryen> Draqul: I was signed in at the time and I just did my normal upgrade every night. (sudo apt-get update & upgrade)
[02:38] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, hmmm do you have ubuntu-restricted-extras instsalled?
[02:38] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh, i dont know how to check it
[02:39] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, that would be a no then.  please install it.
[02:39] <thebenedict> having an odd problem: wireless only works after I install *or* remove the broadcom proprietary driver in system->administration->hardware drivers. is the 'hardware drivers' utility doing something else?
[02:39] <Draqul> Ryen: ok, go to a virtual console - from the login screen hit ctrl+alt+f2, then login and use sudo apt-get install gdm. Let it update
[02:39] <cjae> arrrghhh: mt not running
[02:39] <arrrghhh> thebenedict, probably killing and restarting networking...
[02:39] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh, i am new to ubuntu pls tell me how to check it
[02:40] <Ryen> Draqul: Already tried that, because I thought something might have messed it up. It's all up to date.
[02:40] <arrrghhh> cjae, so pms-linux started on reboot, but you didn't get it on the xmb... does it show anything in the log?  /var/log/debug-<user>.log
[02:40] <thebenedict> arrghhh as in /etc/init.d/networking restart?
[02:40] <Draqul> Ryen: you can attempt to completely uninstall it (purge), then reinstall it.
[02:40] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, just install that meta-package, you'll want it.
[02:40] <thebenedict> doing that independently of install/removing the driver doesn't start up the wireless
[02:40] <arrrghhh> thebenedict, not sure exactly what it does, but i bet something to that effect.  not sure what it does with modprobe.
[02:41] <thebenedict> me neither:)
[02:41] <arrrghhh> lol sorry :P
[02:41] <YeTr2> ... so ubuntu doesn't install aptitude by default...
[02:41] <arrrghhh> YeTr2, it... doesn't?
[02:41] <starn> how would i go about getting only audio stuff for ubuntu studio ?
[02:41] <Ryen> Draqul: Well right now, what I just did, was went into recovery mode; then I told it to give me a prompt and signed in that way. I'm on the computer right now, so I would probably have to sign out again to redo that wouldn't I?
[02:41] <YeTr2> just ran an install.. it's not here
[02:41] <jimmy51_> according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPod, i should be able to plug in and use my ipod touch
[02:41] <jimmy51_> but it just mocks me by doing nothing in amarok and gtkpod
[02:41] <Draqul> Ryen: most likely
[02:42] <Endasil> I just bought an HP Pavilion dv7 laptop.  Many keyboard buttons completely arbitrary as to what's working.  Any suggestions as to where to start?
[02:42] <arrrghhh> YeTr2, weird, i have it.  this isn't a fresh install tho.  i didn't install aptitude...
[02:42] <Ryen> All right, well I will brb, ill purge it and tell you the result.
[02:42] <YeTr2> so, that's 3 things wrong with the installer. trifecta now complete.
[02:43] <cjae> arrrghhh: dont see anything
[02:43] <arrrghhh> cjae, is the log empty?
[02:43] <cjae> arrrghhh: no
[02:43] <arrrghhh> cjae, can you pastebin it pls?
[02:43] <Draqul> Ok - issue number 1 for people who have packages that do not work after a full system upgrade - upgrading your system internally is still not as pretty as it should be! If you have an issue that just doesn't seem to want to be resolved, then go to http://www.ubuntu.com/, download the latest 10.10 iso, check the md5sum, burn it to a disc at the lowest possible burn speed to ensure burn accuracy, then install 10.10 fresh from that livecd. >_> Prob
[02:43] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh, i am installing the package and let me check
[02:43] <arrrghhh> cjae, i swear i've never had this much trouble with it ;)
[02:44] <pankajsmeel> by the way the songs play for a while and then the jerk appear

[02:46] <EeveeTrainer> hi, how do i start a process in the background when im on ssh?
[02:46] <Draqul> EeveeTrainer: using & at the end of a command will background it.
[02:46] <LIMEWIRE> EeveeTrainer: SCREEN
[02:46] <arrrghhh> EeveeTrainer, you can't really start one in the background... you can use screen, and then you can kind of 'minimize' the screen window.
[02:46] <EeveeTrainer> screen ?
[02:46] <cancuengt> hi, I need to jail an user in a dir. Does somebody know how to doit?
[02:46] <LIMEWIRE> EeveeTrainer: MAN SCREEN
[02:46] <ylmfos> hello
[02:47] <arrrghhh> EeveeTrainer, do this.  'screen <program>'.  then hit ctrl-a then d.  this will minimize it.
[02:47] <Draqul> LIMEWIRE: contrary to what others may have told you, caps lock is not cruise control for cool. Please disable caps lock.
[02:47] <arrrghhh> EeveeTrainer, but you should probably read the manpage as our angry friend LIMEWIRE has pointed out.
[02:47] <oracle> hey my ubuntu shutsdown when i hit hibernate. what gives
[02:47] <YeTr2> Draqul: but it does make you sound like Billy Mays
[02:47] <arrrghhh> oracle, well that's what it is... does it not save your ram to disk tho?
[02:47] <LIMEWIRE> Draqul: YOU MAD BRO?
[02:48] <ylmfos> hey my ubuntu shutsdown when i hit hibernate. what gives
[02:48] <Draqul> oracle: Do you have swap? Ram?
[02:48] <ylmfos> faint!
[02:48] <oracle> arrrghhh, no. it just reboots normally
[02:48] <arrrghhh> LIMEWIRE, no, all caps is just kinda odd.
[02:48] <oracle> i have swap and ram sure
[02:48] <oracle> i figure its a setting or something
[02:48] <ylmfos> hey man
[02:48] <arrrghhh> oracle, hmmm... never used hibernate.
[02:48] <twinkie_addict> i droped back to 10.4 alt install cd i had on cli install i like better then 10.10
[02:48] <YeTr2> oracle: how much swap & ram do you have?
[02:48] <ylmfos> i wanna think you are fuse
[02:48] <oracle> my home directory is encrypted, could that be why it doesnt hibernate
[02:48] <Draqul> oracle: No
[02:48] <twinkie_addict> will most likely righ 10.4 till next lts
[02:49] <oracle> yetr2, ram is 1gb swap is 5gb
[02:49] <jimmy51_> !itouch
[02:49] <oracle> i dont know why it's 5
[02:49] <Draqul> Why is swap...oh
[02:49] <starn> when i plug my ipod in it says "Error mounting: mount fs type, bad option bad superblock on /dev/sdg1, missing codepage or helper program, or other error in some cases useful info is found in syslog - try dmesg | tail or so.. what should i do??
[02:49] <jimmy51_> starn: my ipod fix is about to be to throw it in the trash
[02:49] <Draqul> starn: did you try dmesg | tail like the error message recommended?
[02:49] <YeTr2> < jimmy51_> !itouchmyself
[02:50] <YeTr2> at least that's what I saw.
[02:50] <YeTr2> I've been awake too long
[02:50] <`RadioMan> lol
[02:50] <starn> draqul i'll try it now..
[02:50] <Draqul> lmao
[02:50] <Ryen> Draqul: Hey, tried to purge with no success. Still hangs.
[02:50] <oracle> `radioman!
[02:50] <sympt0m> in nano, does WriteOut mean save?
[02:50] <`RadioMan> yay oracle
[02:50] <sympt0m> or... how do i save in nano?
[02:50] <YeTr2> sympt0m: yes

[02:50] <sympt0m> thanks
[02:50] <jimmy51_> sympt0m: i think ctrl x
[02:50] <Draqul> sympt0m: you can save in nano by using ctrl x
[02:51] <jamescarr_> i instaLLED 10.10 ON A WIN7 BOX, DONT SEE GRUB WHEN IT BOOS
[02:51] <sympt0m> that says exit though
[02:51] <Ryen> Draqul: No worries. Might just completely reinstall.
[02:51] <sympt0m> does it save that way?
[02:51] <starn> it says it cannot find valid fat system on sdg1??
[02:51] <Draqul> sympt0m: it saves, just use it
[02:51] <jamescarr_> STILL BOOTS INTO WIN7
[02:51] <jamescarr_> ack
[02:51] <sympt0m> okay thanks
[02:51] <Draqul> Ryen: that sounds like a good idea
[02:51] <starn> and says bogus number of reserved sectors.

[02:52] <manhunter> jamescarr_: what gvim?
[02:52] <jamescarr_> yes
[02:52] <Draqul> manhunter: vim with a gui interface, versus just cli
[02:52] <`RadioMan> weird
[02:52] <YeTr2> Draqul: be a real man and use ed
[02:52] <LIMEWIRE> jamescarr_: YOU MAD BRO? WHATS WITH THE CAPS

[02:53] <Draqul> jamescarr_: Win likes to overwrite the mbr. When I was dualbooting ubuntu and vista, after so many boots  vista would overwrite the mbr so I couldn't access ubuntu. Trash the microsoft.
[02:53] <YeTr2> it's even one less key to type to run the command :)

[02:58] <marvinthemartian> is the GTK# designer still real buggy or something?

[03:00] <manhunter> Draqul: yes , vim is faster
[03:01] <Draqul> marvinthemartian: isn't C# dependant upon the .NET framework provided exclusively through microsoft?

[03:01] <manhunter> Draqul: try gvim too,
[03:01] <Draqul> manhunter: I might. =)
[03:01] <marvinthemartian> apparently .net isnt what you would think
[03:01] <Endasil> Actually I think the Ubuntu is just thinking the Function key is pressed when it's not
[03:01] <Endasil> It has it reversed...is that fixable?
[03:02] <marvinthemartian> the .net framework and the c# language got turned over to the language standard commitee

[03:11] <starn> alright :) i like ipod for the 120gb hd to hold all my songs lol
[03:11] <arrrghhh> starn, sansa products work with linux pretty well too.  just drop the music in :P
[03:11] <manhunter> Draqul:     dpkg <unconvertable> get-selections | grep -v deinstall > ubuntu-files
[03:11] <Draqul> starn: http://www.google.com/#hl=en&expIds=17259,26637,27182,27294&sugexp=ldymls&xhr=t&q=sony+walkman+nwz-w252&cp=18&pf=p&sclient=psy&aq=f&aqi=g4g-o1&aql=&oq=sony+walkman+nwz-w&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=62510c6acf0fe428 - I am wearing it and listening to it now. I love it like crazy
[03:11] <Maahes> I consider it odd that the live cd does not include a client capable of connecting to IRC by default. The older versions of ubuntu used pidgin by default which could log into irc
[03:12] <twinkie_addict> i hate the new chat client in 10.10
[03:12] <Draqul> manhunter: thanks
[03:12] <Draqul> twinkie_addict: then install a new one.
[03:12] <froggyman> Maahes, there are always webclients
[03:12] <starn> can i just use linux to format my ipod.. really don't wanna use xp. though i could. second thought i will follow step by step word by word.. so i'll brb reading and doing crap.

[03:13] <Draqul> starn: mkfs.vfat formats the filesystem
[03:13] <manhunter> Draqul: why?
[03:13] <manhunter> Draqul:     dpkg <unconvertable> get-selections | grep -v deinstall > ubuntu-files , what does this command do?
[03:13] <Draqul> manhunter: Looks like it pulls the installed packages and outputs them to a file located @ "ubuntu-files"
[03:14] <YeTr2> what the?
[03:14] <veritas_rho> is there anything like Dreamweaver that I can get on my Linux machine here for free?
[03:14] <YeTr2> Dear Aptitude, what part of -y don't you understand. I said I wanted them installed without questions. why must you still question me?
[03:14] <froggyman> veritas_rho, a texteditor?
[03:15] <gurpreet> veritas_rho, lookup bluefish
[03:15] <manhunter> Draqul: Pulls the installed packages from internet?
[03:15] <Draqul> YeTr2: it does that to me too.
[03:15] <manhunter> Draqul: downloading the installed packages from internet?
[03:15] <Draqul> manhunter: Dude, are you here to troll?
[03:15] <veritas_rho> im constrained by time...
[03:15] <manhunter> Draqul: not at all
[03:15] <manhunter> Draqul: trying to be clear

[03:16] <n0de4> can anyone help with installing oqgraph on top of mysql-5.1.49-1ubuntu8? i'm not super experienced at linux and i've been stuck on it for an hour or an hour and a half or so
[03:16] <Draqul> manhunter: it pulls them from the installed database. In other words, it just asks the name of each installed package then outputs the names to a file
[03:16] <manhunter> bye
[03:16] <gurpreet> u r welcome
[03:16] <YeTr2> veritas_rho: a publishing app? maybe scribed?
[03:16] <Ryen> Hello, today I updated my system as I do every night, and I rebooted. Grub comes up fine and I can choose Ubuntu, but as soon as that comes up I only get this far: http://imagebin.org/120445 . The login box never comes up. Any ideas?
[03:16] <manhunter> Draqul: then if do " aptitude dist-upgrade , what will happen?
[03:18] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh, hi friend i have installed ubuntu-restricted-extras still the problem exist
[03:18] <manhunter> Draqul: so after "aptitude dist-upgrade" , it will install only the desktop package except other installed software, is it ? right ?
[03:18] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, are you up to date on everything?
[03:18] <manhunter> Draqul: right?
[03:18] <Maahes_> this is hilarious, even on the live cd psmouse can lose sync, this time losing sync meant my system went into suspend
[03:18] <shingen> pankajsmeel: what video card and cpu do you have?
[03:19] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh, yes i have updated ubuntu just one hour ago
[03:19] <TeruFSX> Maahes_ do you know what's with that driver? I have similar issues
[03:19] <TeruFSX> (trackpad guy over here)
[03:19] <RobertSaganek> hey does anyone play Americas Army here for linux cause i got a server up and running if anyone wants to join
[03:19] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, yea i guess specs would be my next question... do you have a dedicated video card, etc
[03:19] <pankajsmeel> shingen: my processor is core 2 due 2 GhZ
[03:19] <Maahes_> TeruFSX: I know acouple potential workarounds, only one of which worked for me, and it worked in an unacceptable way.
[03:19] <Draqul> manhunter: if you use the command issued, it will pull all installed packages. You then fresh install ubuntu and use that file to update the system with all of your old packages.
[03:19] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: i dont have a dedicated video card
[03:20] <TeruFSX> it's not frequent for me, but it happens every once in a while
[03:20] <RobertSaganek> hey does anyone play Americas Army here for linux cause i got a server up and running if anyone wants to join
[03:20] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, so intel then?  for the vid card?
[03:20] <gurpreet> nor RobertSaganek i don't play AA

[03:21] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: no dedicated vid card
[03:21] <manhunter> Draqul: so it will upgrade  the ubuntu-desktop  first ,
[03:21]  * Draqul has a cookie!
[03:21] <Draqul> manhunter: probably, why don't you try it and let me know?

[03:21] <starn> Draqul! it detected i plugged in a digital audio player!!! should i use rythmbox? or should i see about using rockbox on here?
[03:21] <manhunter> Draqul: why may be? didn't you try before?
[03:22] <Draqul> pankajsmeel: use sudo apt-get install -y pastebinit && sudo lshw -C video | pastebinit
[03:22] <TeruFSX> starn rhythmbox would be okay. rockbox is a replacement OS for your audio player
[03:22] <Draqul> starn: rhythmbox works well with iPod
[03:22] <Draqul> manhunter: When I used hardy
[03:22] <starn> well if it keeps messing up should i install new os?
[03:23] <manhunter> what i'm trying to say , if one do "aptitude dist-upgrade" , it will upgrade all installed packages including the ubuntu-desktop, that takes time
[03:23] <Draqul> starn: other than linux? Trash the mp3 player first
[03:23] <veritas_rho> I can't run an apt-get install while I'm installing other stuff in syaptic.. time for a break
[03:23] <manhunter> every six months , doing the aptitude dist-upgrade is cumbersome
[03:23] <Draqul> manhunter: if you do aptitude dist-upgrade then you don't need a snapshot
[03:23] <arrrghhh> starn, i keep all my media on a linux server, then share it to my win machines to update ipods, etc/
[03:23] <Draqul> manhunter: yes, it can be.
[03:24] <arrrghhh> starn, otherwise dual-boot, or VM if you've got good enough hw :D
[03:24] <littlebearz> arrrghhh: that's wise
[03:24] <Draqul> There came a time when I had to choose between the Zune my girlfriend gave me, meaning I had to switch to Windows, or lose the love of my life and keep Linux. I chose Linux. Never looked back once.
[03:25] <littlebearz> arrrghhh: I put my stuff on an External HDD
[03:25] <ramk> im tryin to install IE
[03:25] <Ryen> Hello, today I updated my system as I do every night, and I rebooted. Grub comes up fine and I can choose Ubuntu, but as soon as that comes up I only get this far: http://imagebin.org/120445 . The login box never comes up. Any ideas?
[03:25] <littlebearz> Draqul: I would keep both :P
[03:25] <StaticShock> what's a good packet sniffer that can make decent sense of TCP traffic destined for other machines?
[03:25] <ramk> in installed wine
[03:25] <Draqul> ramk: why?
[03:25] <arrrghhh> littlebearz, well this way all my hdds with media are ext4 - don't have to worry about fragmentation or any of that mess.
[03:25] <veritas_rho> Draqul: kudos
[03:25] <ramk> i want to access remote web workplace
[03:25] <Draqul> littlebearz: To each their own
[03:25] <ramk> it needs activex
[03:26] <littlebearz> ramk: use mstsc.exe then, or rdesktop
[03:26] <manhunter> Draqul: if it upgrades all installed packages,then     dpkg <unconvertable> get-selections | grep -v deinstall > ubuntu-files is not necessary,it's all the same doing "aptitude dist-upgrade" and     dpkg <unconvertable> get-selections | grep -v deinstall > ubuntu-files && aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade "
[03:26] <arrrghhh> Draqul, i _have_ to run windows for some things.  like my stupid work's remote access...
[03:26] <ramk> where can i install the mstsc
[03:26] <ramk> page
[03:26] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: Draqul: http://pastebin.com/Pdtyq19C
[03:26] <manhunter> and dpkg <unconvertable> set-selections < ubuntu-files
[03:26] <YeTr2> I think the only thing I like about the default ubuntu install is the complete lack of brown.
[03:26] <multipa3> anyone know why ubuntu is freezing during every load at the splash screen? I just got a new comp, gtx460 gfx.. bad driver possibly?
[03:27] <manhunter> if one has to upgrade all installed packages every six months then why would one use ubuntu?
[03:27] <YeTr2> no, wait
[03:27] <Draqul> arrrghhh: I understand. I am not knocking Windows. It's an excellent OS that gets the job done for most people. I know a lot of people are forced to use it at work, or for some apps. To each their own.
[03:27] <YeTr2> I stand corrected, there is brown on the screen. darnit.
[03:27] <Draqul> YeTr2: I miss the brown
=== asig2 is now known as asig
[03:27] <TeruFSX> manhunter because one doesn't find it very inconvenient or uses the upgrade tool like me
[03:27] <ramk> now i cannot remove wine
[03:27] <TeruFSX> ramk why not
[03:27] <ramk> :(
[03:27] <arrrghhh> Draqul, you'll never see a windows server in my house tho friend :D
[03:27] <ramk> i dont know
[03:27] <ramk> yet to figure out
[03:28] <veritas_rho> Ryen: when you updated, you upgraded to 9.10 and selected an option to rewrite your grub
[03:28] <Draqul> ramk: why do you want IE?
[03:28] <TeruFSX> what are you using to uninstall it
[03:28] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: Draqul: http://pastebin.com/Pdtyq19C
[03:28] <ramk> i want to connect remote web workplace
[03:28] <manhunter> why is the aptitude /apt-get service not available forever?after one year or so this aptitude server is finished then one has to reinstall ubuntu and reinstall all other packages too,that's time consuming cumbersome,disgusting
[03:28] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, i see it.  i915... haven't found much about it in 10.10.
[03:28] <ramk> draqul:it needs activex
[03:28] <gurpreet> ramk, i don't know what steps you've followed but this looks promising http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Installation
[03:29] <manhunter> TeruFSX: because there are many places in the world where bandwith is very poor
[03:29] <Ryen> veritas_rho: No. I have had 10.04 the entire time. I just updated my system since I had to install 38 new packages. I rebooted and now it just hangs.
[03:29] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: any suggestion what to do next
[03:29] <mudgoon> #python
[03:29] <gurpreet> hehe
[03:29] <YeTr2> manhunter: stay with the LTS releases if you don't like to try and stay current. those last 2+ years.
[03:29] <manhunter> TeruFSX: it will take two days to upgrade all packages
[03:29] <littlebearz> Ryen: that's why you don't update Lol
[03:29] <TeruFSX> manhunter then either use LTS, don't update for a while, or get CDs
[03:29] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, not yet...
[03:29] <ramk> gurpreet: thx but is there anything without installing IE
[03:29] <Draqul> manhunter: if you don't like it, why not write your own distro, buy a server, and host it yourself?
[03:29] <ramk> i hate IE
[03:29] <TeruFSX> draqul that's terrible advice
[03:29] <Draqul> TeruFSX: how so?
[03:29] <Shishire> manhunter, you may be interested in the Long-Term Support versions.
[03:29] <Tw|sT> LTS distros are 3 years support for workstations, 5 years for servers.
[03:30] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: there is one change after installing ubuntu-restricted-extras i can play mp3 files without any jerk
[03:30] <littlebearz> TeruFSX: Draqul is a good advice
[03:30] <gurpreet> ramk, Remote Desktop maybe??
[03:30] <TeruFSX> how does that fix anything
[03:30] <YeTr2> ramk: ies4linux
[03:30] <drewbert> Okay, when ubuntu get's up to S for names. The S HAS to be SMARMY.  smarmy serpent, smarmy shrew (like that one cause it's a double entendre), smarmy serval, you name it, as long as you don't also describe it, cause I already picked the adjective
[03:30] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, hm ok good.  vlc still has video issues?
[03:30] <Shishire> Upgrades are never required.  They help fix bugs and add new features, but no upgrade is ever required.
[03:30] <gurpreet> thats the link i gave him YeTr2
[03:30] <manhunter> Shishire: yes,you are correct , not only me but also those ,where bandwith is very poor
[03:30] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: not only vlc but media player had video issues
[03:30] <ramk> but it needs activex remember
[03:30] <drewbert> Is Mark Shuttleworth here, cause I need to PM him?
[03:31] <Tw|sT> Suave Skunk?
[03:31] <Tw|sT> lol
[03:31] <Tw|sT> :)
[03:31] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: is there any specific software required to play flv files in ubuntu
[03:31] <arrrghhh> drewbert, yea dude, you just missed him...
[03:31] <drewbert> Tw|sT: smarmy skunk
[03:31] <gurpreet> lol
[03:31] <Tw|sT> I dig it
[03:31] <drewbert> arrrghhh: ARRRGGGGhhhh
[03:31] <Tw|sT> right on man
[03:31] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, i don't believe so.
[03:32] <Draqul> I am awaiting Horny Horntoad when they roll the alphabet back around. That release is going to be beast
[03:32] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: anyway thanks for your help
[03:32] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: atleast i can hear audio songs
[03:32] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, sorry... that's a very odd issue.
[03:32] <gurpreet> ramk, probably a Virtual machine would be a good idea
[03:32] <manhunter> Ryen: that's why don't do dist-upgrade
[03:32] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, can you pastebin your /var/log/messages file?
[03:33] <ramk> virtual machi... some one here suggested rdesktop
[03:33] <ramk> i want to know what is that
[03:33] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: how to do that
[03:33] <gurpreet> that was me
[03:33] <gurpreet> :P
[03:33] <gurpreet> please elaborate your problem a bit so that we can chew on it
[03:33] <Ryen> manhunter: I didn't do a dist-upgrade.
[03:33] <arrrghhh> pankajsmeel, there's probably a slick way to do it, but i'd just open it with gedit and copy/paste it into a pastebin.

[03:34] <arrrghhh> veritas_rho, do you have an ubuntu related question...?
[03:34] <YeTr2> ramk: rdesktop is the linux client for windows remote desktop. you connect to another windows machine and use the browser from that machine.
[03:34] <manhunter> Ryen: so which system are you on now?
[03:34] <Ryen> A different partition. Same computer.
[03:35] <YeTr2> ramk: it's like VNC, but with more features.

[03:36] <ramk> vnc not workng
[03:36] <Maahes_> okay this is a question I don't know if anyone has an answer for: I have a dell laptop, which by default has a bunch of system-keys where the F keys are, and you have to hold down Fn to access the Fkeys, on windows this is a good idea, as you don't use Fkeys all that much, on linux its very annoying
[03:36] <Maahes_> Is there a way to reverse this behavior?
[03:36] <Maahes_> make them Fkeys by default
[03:36] <Draqul> Maahes_: I have those too. You get used to it. You can shortcut their functions using System-Preferences-Keyboard Shortcuts
[03:37] <deexannihilate> I just purchased a Targus DVDROM and I cannot get any DVDs to play. It is reading the DVDs but once I open them, the programs open but nothing plays. Anyone know how to fix this?
[03:37] <TeruFSX> Maahes_ I think Fn combinations are handled by the keyboard hardware
[03:37] <YeTr2> Maahes_: you might be able to change it with xmodmap
[03:37] <TeruFSX> deexannihilate are they commercial DVDs?
[03:37] <Maahes_> Hrrm, I wonder if I can map Fn to capslock
[03:37] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhh: gedit can not open the file
[03:37] <deexannihilate> terufsx: yes
[03:37] <Maahes_> That's at least a more convenient mode selector placing
[03:38] <deexannihilate> TeruFSX: I've tried two different ones
[03:38] <Tw|sT> It gets kinda memory hungry, but my dev team loves the setup I put together on their servers (HP 8way Xeon box (x2) w/ 32GB ram, & 4TB SAS storage).  They were having to use Xming, which worked well, but it's really optimized for a LAN connection, and some of the dev team come in over VPN, so that was too slow in their case.  VNC+XDMCP hooked 'em up tho
[03:38] <TeruFSX> deexannihilated you will need some third-party software for that

[03:47] <phpninja> that shows my path, but where is it located? i checked .profile
[03:47] <phpninja> in home directory, but it doesnt match up
[03:47] <TeruFSX> Tom1: don't erase your existing Ubuntu partition if it contains anything you want to keep
[03:48] <RobertSaganek> s0dium: having troubles with docky... when i install its fine it runs fine but then all of a sudden my computer craps out and won't restart untill i unplug and pull the bios battery
[03:48] <s0dium> that is a strange problem robert
[03:48] <RobertSaganek> tell me about it
[03:48] <TeruFSX> phpninja I'm not quite sure. I don't think it's set up by bash, though
[03:48] <Renderspec> I found out that "There is no way to use iptables with Ubuntu to restrict access based on the program name, because the Ubuntu Linux kernel is not compiled with the options required to enable the --cmd-owner flag." Hope Ubuntu adds this flag option in future. I think it's useful.
[03:49] <Tom1> TeruFSX: after the update, I can't get into ubuntu anymore
[03:49] <Tom1> TeruFSX: only the windows boot option is functioning correctly
[03:49] <s0dium> what version of ubuntu are you using robert?
[03:49] <RobertSaganek> 10.10
[03:49] <woodyjlw> in ubuntu 10.10 how can I change password in terminal?
[03:49] <TeruFSX> woodyjlw
[03:49] <TeruFSX> passwd
[03:49] <Terrance> can someone help me to do a proxy server on ubuntu :S or at least a good tutorial ive been trying to google it but nothing helpful
[03:50] <RobertSaganek> s0dium: what is the command in terminal so i can past my computer hardware list in pastbin for u
[03:50] <Maahes_> oh, last question is there a way defrag FAT partitions from linux?
[03:50] <Maahes_> file defragmentation, not block defragmentation
[03:50] <Jordan_U> Tom1: What happens when you try to boot Ubuntu?
[03:50] <gurpreet> Maahes_, no there isn't a reliable way for that
[03:51] <pankajsmeel> arrrghhhh: all the files are now playing in movieplayer properly but not in vlc
[03:51] <pankajsmeel>  thanks everbody
[03:51] <gurpreet> RobertSaganek, lspci and lsusb maybe?
[03:51] <Tom1> Jordan_U: using the last command you had me use, I now see many linux options on the boot menu. If i try to use the most recent version the monitor stops receiving signal
[03:52] <Draqul> Is python now python2/3 in Ubuntu?
[03:52] <gurpreet> Terrance, have you tried squid? its easy to setup and run
[03:52] <Tom1> Jordan_U: if I pick the oldest version, it shows the login screen for 10.10 (not sure why?) but it seems to be frozen (i can't type or use the keyboard or mouse to do anything)
[03:52] <Maahes_> RobertSaganek: sudo lswh > somefile.txt
[03:52] <trism> Draqul: python 2.6 is default, but python 3 is available
[03:53] <gurpreet> lshw
[03:53] <Draqul> trism: I am in Arch and we just switched to python3, so I was curious. =P Thanks
[03:53] <RobertSaganek> http://pastebin.com/Dn1ttGr9 here is my pastbin
[03:53] <Maahes_> RobertSaganek: sorry, lshw
[03:53] <Maahes_> I have butterfingers
[03:53] <gurpreet> RobertSaganek, thats  sudo lshw > hwlist.txt
[03:54] <RobertSaganek> Maahes: their is my past bin... did u see my question
[03:54] <Maahes_> RobertSaganek: I didn't see your original question no
[03:55] <RobertSaganek> Maahes: docky installs and runs fine but the my computer tards out and won't restart untill i unpulug and remove the bios battery
[03:55] <tiox> Asking again, is there a way with Linux's default tools to get the URL of a radio stream that normally would be received by a flash player?
[03:56] <woodyjlw> TeruFSX,  thanks that did it
[03:56] <tiox> It's a streamtheworld player I am trying to target.
[03:57] <Tom1> Jordan_U: should I just reinstall at this point?
[03:57] <Jordan_U> Tom1: Try editing the most recent entry, by pressing 'e' at the boot menu, and add "nomodeset" after "quiet splash " (on the same line). Then press ctrl+x to execute the modified entry.
[03:58] <Maahes_> RobertSaganek: ..... pastebin /var/log/kern.log and /var/log/messages
[03:59] <Tom1> Jordan_U: i don't see a "quiet splash"
[03:59] <Tom1> Jordan_U: the first line says "recordfail"
[03:59] <gurpreet> tiox, amarok rhythmbox both can play internet radio, i don't know whether they play your specific staion
[04:00] <geoff918> I'm having trouble compiling software named BondDB http://pastebin.com/94NPehhZ
[04:00] <tiox> Wouldn't I normally need the IP of the station?
[04:00] <gurpreet> a url maybe
[04:01] <Foxhoundz1> I need help. I've tried this on #tremulous but it didn't work. Basically...
[04:01] <Foxhoundz1> After installing Tremulous 1.1 on Ubuntu 10.10 the touch pad is hypersenitive in-game
[04:02] <Karen_m> on ubuntu, I'm trying to keep track of my database layout with sqlite.  Anyone know a good app that will let me change things around with ease?
[04:02] <Foxhoundz1> I've turned down the mouse senitivity and acceleration the minimum but It's not working
[04:02] <RobertSaganek> Maahes:http://pastebin.com/mq41LR4E
[04:02] <Tom1> Jordan_U: it says "recordfail" for all of the linux boot options actually
[04:02] <fictive> what would cause my enter key to not input newline in text editors when I'm in a screen (all I see ie. in vim is "M+newline", in nano it looks like it's inserting the HOME value)? inputs newline when I'm not in a screen
[04:03] <Connor1> Quick question
[04:03] <starn> is there a program for linux like scan disk where it checks the disk for bad sectors than blocks them off from being used?
[04:03] <Connor1> Anyone here use nano?
[04:03] <JonathanC> Hello!
[04:03] <JonathanC> I seem to be getting very slow pings/horrible tracert results on Ubuntu 10.10.
[04:03] <Jordan_U> Tom1: That's normal.
[04:03] <shingen> Connor1: yes
[04:03] <Connor1> shingen any way to enable an actual word wrap on it?
[04:03] <JonathanC> I tried the same thing on my laptop running Windows, and I am actually getting better results.
[04:03] <Connor1> I'm tired of typing long lines and having it not wrap my text.
[04:03] <shingen> Connor1:  -ww when starting from cli
[04:03] <JonathanC> Does anyone know of a bug/problem that might cause this problem?
[04:03] <fictive> Jordan_U: my favorite problem solver :)
[04:03] <shingen> Connor1: e.g., nano -ww
[04:03] <Connor1> That doesn't help me
[04:03] <Connor1> I mean
[04:03] <shingen> Connor1: alias it :)
[04:04] <JonathanC> It is very annoying to not be able to browse the internet or do anything online.
[04:04] <Connor1> I want it to display the actual wrap
[04:04] <JonathanC> Anyone have any ideas?
[04:04] <Maahes_> geoff918: have you looked at the c-function being named? It may be a typo on the part of the programmer, maybe you just have a bad release
[04:04] <RobertSaganek> Maahes: did you get that and i'm afk for about 5 going to get smoke
[04:04] <Connor1> shingen any ideas on doing that?
[04:04] <shingen> Connor1: hmmm... never knew nano / pico to actually wrap on screen... could be wrong though... man page for that
[04:05] <Karen_m> what is a good piece of software to manage sql table layouts ...  those kinds of associations?
[04:05] <JonathanC> :( So no one else has my problem?
[04:05] <Tom1> Jordan_U: okay, is it bad that there's no "quiet splash"?
[04:05] <gurpreet> Connor1, i suggest using gedit if you can, otherwise vim would be a good start
[04:05] <shingen> Karen_m: you mean like SQLiteManager ?
[04:05] <Connor1> I use a CLI interface.
[04:05] <Maahes_> got it RobertSaganek
[04:05] <JonathanC> :( back to Fedora then. Cya.
[04:05] <fictive> anyone have any ideas? (this is specific to my user)
[04:05] <obs3rv3r> I would suggest nano if for a beginner.
[04:05] <Connor1> I'm already used to nano, and I prefer using it
[04:06] <Karen_m> i've never used sqlitemanager
[04:06] <shingen>  I've been using pico for the last 20 years :P
[04:06] <Karen_m> checking it out
[04:06] <Connor1> I need a cli text editor for doing classwork.
[04:07] <Connor1> Any recommendations? I'm already really used to nano.
[04:07] <Jordan_U> Tom1: It's not normal but it shouldn't hurt anything. Can you pastebin your grub.cfg or a screenshot of that menu entry?
[04:07] <preds> is there any way to do sudo echo "123.123.123.123 somehostname.com" >> /etc/hosts without getting access denied?
[04:07] <geoff918> nano is probably easiest, there is also vi (harder) and pico (never used) which are popular
[04:07] <obs3rv3r> Connor1: if you are used to nano. Thats fine. Else vim is something you should start.
[04:07] <Therstrium> i second vi or vim
[04:07] <fictive> Connor1: vim :)
[04:07] <Connor1> obs3rv3r the text doesn't wrap on screen
[04:07] <shingen> pico is nano.... vi is goofy... vim over vi any day
[04:07] <Connor1> Which is what I need nano to do...
[04:08] <shingen> Connor1: you can't make something that's been around for 20 years do something it can't...
[04:08] <Connor1> Dang
[04:08] <Tom1> Jordan_U: how can i screen shot the boot menu?
[04:08] <Jordan_U> Tom1: Sorry, meant to say photograph :)
[04:09] <Tom1> Jordan_U: no worries
[04:09] <starn> is there a program for linux like scan disk where it checks the disk for bad sectors than blocks them off from being used?
[04:09] <obs3rv3r> Connor1: Try vim. You will love it.
[04:10] <Connor1> obs3rv3r it's neat so far
[04:10] <Connor1> Except esc :w isn't quitting it
[04:10] <she_dyed>  :wq
[04:10] <obs3rv3r> or :x
[04:10] <geoff918> This is the affected file (compile error above) http://pastebin.com/8zm2bH3Y
[04:11] <Scunizi> In the latest Gimp provided by ubuntu, does it have the ability to "stick" the separate windows into one?
[04:11] <Connor1> Gpt ot
[04:11] <Connor1> :p;
[04:11] <Connor1> Got it*
[04:11] <shingen> :wq!
[04:11] <Connor1> Lol
[04:11] <Connor1> Another question
[04:11] <FloodBot1> Connor1: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[04:11] <Connor1> Shut up FloodBot1
[04:11] <fictive> lol
[04:11] <obs3rv3r> haha
[04:11] <Connor1> Any way to get my ubuntu install to boot directly into a CLI environment?
[04:11] <she_dyed> yes
[04:11] <psusi> emacs >> vim ;_
[04:11] <she_dyed> hit e at boot
[04:12] <pi3ch> anybody uses lftp?
[04:12] <she_dyed> and enter 3
[04:12] <Tom1> Jordan_U: http://pastebin.com/4kq8zGnK
[04:12] <Connor1> she_dyed isn't there a file I can edit?
[04:12] <klync> pi3ch: i have used it but not for a while
[04:12] <she_dyed> yes in grub
[04:12] <Tom1> Jordan_U: I typed it in so there might be minor typos
[04:12] <Connor1> she_dyed any tutorialon this?
[04:12] <Maahes_> RobertSaganek: From those logs the only thing I can see is you have a buggy usb mouse, did you shutdown normally or crash? lets try pastebin ing /var/log/boot.log
[04:12] <starn> anyone?
[04:12] <gurpreet> starn, lookup badblocks but be very carefull when you use it
[04:12] <she_dyed> !grub | Connor1
[04:12] <ubottu> Connor1: grub is the default boot manager for Ubuntu releases before Karmic (9.10). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - GRUB how-tos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto - See !grub2 for Karmic onwards.
[04:12] <magicblaze0073> is anyone using toshiba protege r705/700 + ubuntu here? My ubuntu freezes quite frequently on this laptop...
[04:12] <magicblaze0073> any ideas on how to debug this?
[04:12] <obs3rv3r> she_dyed: or just stop gdm from starting
[04:13] <klync> what's the best way to install sun's jdk in ubuntu? download and run the installer from their site, or is there a make-java-pkg like in debian?
[04:13] <obs3rv3r> she_dyed: sorry its Connor1 .
[04:13] <TeruFSX> magicblaze0073 is it a full freeze or a mouse freeze?
[04:13] <starn> gurpreet alright. no problem using on my broken ipod if this don't work i'm gonna hammer it with an real hammer..
[04:13] <she_dyed> obs3rv3r: thanks for the input tho =)
[04:13] <shado`> lol
[04:13] <Jordan_U> Tom1: That looks fine. Add the "nomodeset" after "ro".
[04:13] <klync> Connor1: it might be enough for you to just start the installer, and hit ctrl-alt-f2 to get a console
[04:13] <Connor1> I don't want to do that
[04:13] <fictive> Jordan_U: do you have some time to help me with a little problem again? :)
[04:13] <obs3rv3r> Connor1: all 3 options :P ?
[04:13] <Connor1> I already do that
[04:13] <shingen> Connor1: mod your init ring to not start gdm
[04:14] <Connor1> Where is it located?
[04:14] <gurpreet> starn, yes you can use it on your ipod
[04:14]  * obs3rv3r sysv-rc-conf a very very useful tool
[04:14] <shingen> Connor1: it's prolly init ring 5 or something, check rc.5....
[04:14] <gurpreet> but again carefill with the syntax
[04:14] <magicblaze0073> TeruFSX: Full freeze
[04:14] <magicblaze0073> only reboot makes it work
[04:14] <gurpreet> *carefull
[04:14] <starn> gurpreet please say it's easy to use... and maybe has an gui......
[04:14] <gurpreet> no
[04:14] <gurpreet> :
[04:14] <gurpreet> :)
[04:15] <magicblaze0073> i replaced the hard drive with ssd and loaded ubuntu on it...it boots, i could update/upgrade using apt-get...tried to look into dmesg, but cant figure out whats wrong
[04:15] <she_dyed> all the gui goodness was sucked into the ipod
[04:15] <Connor1> I already tried to edit /etc/inittab but it was blank
[04:15] <Connor1> Any ideas?
[04:15] <Tom1> Jordan_U: the resolution is messed up but it logged into 10.10!
[04:16] <RobertSaganek> Maahes: boot.log is very short
[04:16] <Jordan_U> Tom1: Great. What graphics card do you have?
[04:16] <obs3rv3r> Connor1: use sysv-rc-conf and locate gdm and stop it from starting.
[04:17] <shingen> whoops, that's applicable on other distros, not debian bested ones...    sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove or sudo update-rc.d -f gdm defaults
[04:17] <Connor1> obs3rv3r will do
[04:17] <magicblaze0073> TeruFSX: my dmesg -> paste.pocoo.org/show/282052
[04:17] <magicblaze0073> any ideas on how to find out whats wrong?
[04:18] <magicblaze0073> the screen dims out quite fast on the machine...
[04:18] <Tom1> Jordan_U: it's an ati radeon 4670
[04:18] <TeruFSX> well there's that oops
[04:18] <TeruFSX> probably hangs after that
[04:18] <TeruFSX> i'll look into it a bit more
[04:19] <fictive> what would cause my enter key to not input newline in text editors when I'm in a screen (all I see ie. in vim is "M+newline", in nano it looks like it's inserting the HOME value)? inputs newline when I'm not in a screen. This is specific to my user, only on my server.

[04:22] <gdoteof_home> or run a vm with stripped down xp and run dream weaver in that
[04:22] <magicblaze0073> then its quiet till it doesnt hang again
[04:23] <Jordan_U> Tom1: If the current proprietary driver supports your card yes. When you say download thought it suggests you're not installing via System > Administration > Hardware drivers. Installing the driver from ATI's website is a bad idea.
[04:23] <jiha_> quir
[04:23] <jiha_> quit
[04:23] <jiha_> exit
[04:23] <quiescens> technically no, a lot of systems automatically turn the fans to full when things stop responding, it doesn't neccesarily indicate an overheating issue
[04:23] <marckitos> fictive, thank you man !
[04:23] <gdoteof_home> i see.  i thought it may be getting really hot, and then the fans go on to cool it when it hangs
[04:23] <Tom1> Jordan_U: I'm using System > Administration > Additional Drivers
[04:24] <Jordan_U> Tom1: Ok, then yes. Installing the proprietary driver again should solve the problem.
