[06:50] <shazbotmcnasty> I used md5deep to actually do the md5sum
[06:50] <Nitrohax> Sath> lets us know what happens
[06:50] <chelz> theadmin: "recovery mode" http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/image55.png
[06:50] <Sath> ok
[06:50] <chelz> Sath: recovery mode
[06:50] <bullgard> shazbotmcnasty: So, what did you not understand in it?
[06:51] <shazbotmcnasty> the stuff is not at the original place
[06:51] <chelz> oh
[06:51] <chelz> Sath: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/resetpassword
[06:51] <chelz> yeah there's no specific reset passoption
[06:51] <theadmin> chelz: Here's what mine has, off top of my head: root console, repair X.org (this one dissapeared in Karmic though), update grub, resume to normal boot... and some other sutff
[06:51] <chelz> theadmin: yeah, gotta drop to a shell prompt and do passwd
[06:52] <shazbotmcnasty> okay, the stuff is at "/media/BIGTB/Big TB/torrentbackup/My Torrents" - the original file is at "~/My Torrents"
[06:52] <theadmin> chelz: Oh, right, makes sense now
[06:52] <chelz> would be nice to have a reset password option right there
[06:52] <chelz> i thought there was one for some reason
[06:52] <shazbotmcnasty> I can do 'md5sum -c file.md5' that I made, but it looks in ~/My Torrents
[06:52] <Sath> I did boot menu and I have HD/CD/Removable devices/Network Boot/Diagnostics
[06:52] <shazbotmcnasty> not the place that they actually are.
[06:52] <Nitrohax> chelz> might be to much of a security risk though you know
[06:52] <Sath> should I have pressed 2 for setup instead of 0 for boot options?
[06:53] <Nitrohax> Sath> somethings changed hold on
[06:53] <Sath> ok
[06:53] <Nitrohax> http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/resetpassword
[06:53] <Nitrohax> that's from chelz
[06:53] <chelz> Sath: follow that link. get to the GRUB menu. you might have to press esc to get it.
[06:54] <theadmin> chelz: Sath: or shift

[06:54] <misterB> Does anybody know how to get DSL working in karmic? I've tried pppoeconf. That messed with my network devices and caused a big headache. I tried adding the launchpad ppa, and I had no wireless. Can anybody help me out?
[06:54] <Sath> lemme check this out, I esc'd out of the boot menu and it logged me in. Going to reboot now
[06:55] <ActionParsnip> !adsl | misterB
[06:55] <ubottu> misterB: Setting up an ADSL/PPPoE connection? Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ADSLPPPoE
[06:55] <SpaceGhostC2C> ActionParsnip!
[06:55] <ActionParsnip> misterB: thats the way you set it up, if you grab a router you don't have that hastle ;)
[06:55] <ActionParsnip> SpaceGhostC2C: sup
[06:56] <SpaceGhostC2C> ActionParsnip: just rolling out my own linux distro and looking for people to help.
[06:56] <Nitrohax> SpaceGhostC2C> tell zorak i said hi!
[06:56] <bazhang> !ot > SpaceGhostC2C
[06:56] <ubottu> SpaceGhostC2C, please see my private message
[06:56] <misterB> ActionParsnip: Like I said. pppoeconf broke my computer before. That's why I'm here asking.
[06:56] <SpaceGhostC2C> bazhang: sry bazhang.
[06:56] <misterB> ActionParsnip: and the person I'm setting it up for doesn't have a router and doesn't want to buy one.
[06:57] <bntly> misterB: then they are silly :/
[06:57] <Nitrohax> misterB> i'll look at somethings also
[06:57] <misterB> bntly: now that's something I can't change.
[06:57] <bntly> misterB: hehe very true!
[06:57] <Nitrohax> misterB> you say dsl right?
[06:58] <misterB> Nitrohax: yeah.
[06:58] <Nitrohax> misterB> under the networking options all the dsl settings are there without having to d/l anytign else
[06:58] <bntly> Has anyone else been having problems with flash 10 under lucid? Choppy video but fine sound playback?
[06:58] <Nitrohax> misterB> what are you trying to do with the dsl?
[06:58] <ravibn> Hi! I have a problem with my Frontech ecam JIL 2214. When gstream-properties is used it works perfectly alright.
[06:58] <ravibn> But when I use skype or cheese webcam booth any other application it does show blank
[06:58] <ravibn> This webcam is fully functional with www.chatroulette.com and u can see me online
[06:58] <bazhang> bntly, #ubuntu+1 for lucid please
[06:58] <FloodBot3> ravibn: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[06:58] <misterB> Nitrohax: yeah.
[06:59] <bntly> bazhang: thanks :D
[06:59] <misterB> Nitrohax: was using network manager, but that broke in Karmic
[06:59] <Nitrohax> misterB> what prob are you having with the dsl setup?
[06:59] <ravibn> Ok! FloodBot3
[06:59] <Nitrohax> shouldn't have. did you make sure it's fully up to date?
[06:59] <misterB> Nitrohax: connection tries to connect and never does.
[07:00] <misterB> Nitrohax: it times out I think
[07:00] <Nitrohax> misterB>  one sec i'm pming
[07:00] <shazbotmcnasty> when I do md5sum -c file.md5 - and it says "OK" after... that means that the file matched up right???
[07:00] <Sath> Having issues getting to the recovery boot, neither esc nor shift worked, I'm in the setup menu right now
[07:00] <shazbotmcnasty> or do I have to md5 again?
[07:00] <Sath> and it has Quickboot enabled, I don't suppose that is part of the issue?
[07:01] <Nitrohax> Sath> http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/resetpassword
[07:01] <Nitrohax> Sath> did you try that link?
[07:01] <leeping_> mtx_init, fsck is returning an error.  It says : "only 1 or 2 FATs are supported, not 235."
[07:01] <ravibn> Hi! I have a problem with my Frontech ecam JIL 2214. When gstream-properties is used it works perfectly alright. But when I use skype or cheese webcam booth any other application it does show blank. This webcam is fully functional with www.chatroulette.com and u can see me online. Can u provide a fix?
[07:01] <mtx_init> leeping_: maybe it only does fat and fat16
[07:01] <leeping_> ActionParsnip, are you still here?  It seems foremost is a way to recover individual files, whereas I'm hoping to get the entire partition back
[07:01] <Nitrohax> ravibn> try skype prefrences?
[07:01] <Sath> Yeah I clicked it but it has said the same thing you guys said, aka press esc to select recovery boot
[07:01] <Sath> which is what I'm having trouble accessing :\
[07:01] <ActionParsnip> shazbotmcnasty: yes :D
[07:01] <leeping_> mtx_init, it supports FAT32.  I just don't know if it recognizes my disk as such
[07:02] <shazbotmcnasty> ActionParsnip, YES
[07:02] <mtx_init> is it mounted leeping_ ?
[07:02] <Nitrohax> misterB> do you need a log in or user name to get on the dsl?
[07:02] <leeping_> mtx_init, the partition doesn't show up.  It simply says /dev/sdb
[07:02] <s4aluck> do somebody has tripwire installed?
[07:02] <Sath> although it does say 'hold' the shift key, I'll try that
[07:02] <leeping_> There is no /dev/sdb1
[07:02] <SpaceGhostC2C> s4aluck: do you have a question?
[07:02] <ActionParsnip> leeping_: then use a wildcard for the mask of files yuo require recovering. Do you not have a backup of the data. This would be smarter and easier and garuntee results
[07:02] <ravibn> Nitrohax: I tried that and there is a test button. when I press that it shows blank options ---> video
[07:02] <s4aluck> SpaceGhostC2C:  yes, I was trying to make the setting but something went wrong
[07:02] <leeping_> ActionParsnip, I wish I had.  They aren't my files, there is no backup
[07:03] <mtx_init> leeping_: try fsck.vfat /dev/sdb1
[07:03] <SpaceGhostC2C> s4aluck: you should ask your question. What exactly are you trying to do, and what is happening?
[07:03] <mtx_init> see if it works
[07:03] <ravibn> Nitrohax : it really works great with www.chatroulette.com why not with skype?
[07:03] <leeping_> mtx_init, No such file or directory
[07:04] <Nitrohax> there should be a setting with skype to control the hue and brightness
[07:04] <leeping_> mtx_init, the best luck I've had so far was with GetDataBack (a Windows program).  It was able to recover most of the files except for the most recent ones, and the directory names got all scrambled up
[07:04] <mtx_init> ActionParsnip: what did you nmean by a wildcard?
[07:04] <s4aluck> SpaceGhostC2C: See this http://pastie.org/877842
[07:04] <mtx_init> leeping_: I use it all the time, its pretty good
[07:04] <leeping_> mtx_init, do you know if it's possible to get directory names back?
[07:04] <ravibn> Nitrohax : lette me try changing that in skype once again
[07:04] <ActionParsnip> mtx_init: a * like in searches etc, it means ';everything'
[07:05] <mtx_init> leeping_: I usually just take what it gives
[07:05] <nomad77> leeping_: if all else fails,try testdisk,but read about its useage first before using.
[07:05] <Sath> Both shift and network boot are bringing me to a MBR 2FA: prompt
[07:05] <Sath> I am so confused, lol
[07:05] <leeping_> nomad77, I tried testdisk as well.  It first reports no partition found.  If I try the deeper scan, it seems to report a partition found, but doesn't allow me to select it
[07:06] <leeping_> nomad77, I think I should be able to get some utility out of testdisk, but I don't know why it's not allowing me to select the partition that it found
[07:06] <leeping_> maybe the partition is blank because it has no name?
[07:07] <nomad77> leeping_: hmm well distrowatch-search will let you look for forensic,recovery distro's,etc.
[07:07] <leeping_> nomad77, I'll see if I can find anything there.  Let me try testdisk again though :)
[07:07] <Sath> I cannot for the life of me figure out why my computer won't let me into this area
[07:07] <ravibn> Nitorhax : there are no hue and brightness setting are not there in Skype under options---->video devices but it is pointing to the correct device file /dev/video0
[07:08] <Nitrohax> one sec
[07:08] <s4aluck> SpaceGhostC2C: I think I made something wrong. Probably I made mistake with editing the setins. Can you help?
[07:08] <ActionParsnip> leeping_: you only need testdisk or dd_rescue if trhe drive is physically failing, you can use foremost directly on the partition if its healthy
[07:09] <Sath> MBR 2FA prompt again, ugh
[07:09] <leeping_> ActionParsnip, I doubt that I can use foremost if Ubuntu can't find the partition.. it can only find the device.  or am I mistaken?
[07:09] <ravibn> Nitrohax : my Q is how come it is working with www.chatroulette.com and gstreamer-properties why not with any other apps ?
[07:09] <ActionParsnip> leeping_: then use the device raw, its all good
[07:09] <leeping_> nomad77, testdisk reports having found a FAT32 partition, but it doesn't allow me to select it after the search is over.  I don't know why it's doing this
[07:09] <DcMeese> Anybody know of a good DEBIAN manager?
[07:09] <Nitrohax> ravibn> looking at it right now
[07:10] <mihir> how to open corel draw .cdr file in ubuntu Inkscape is not able to open cdr file is there any other way to open it
[07:10] <SpaceGhostC2C> DcMeese: yourself?
[07:10] <ActionParsnip> DcMeese: debian isnt supported here
[07:10] <DcMeese> ActionParsnip: Oh :( why not?
[07:10] <s4aluck> do somebody know how to edit the setins for tripwire???
[07:10] <ravibn> Nitrohax : thank u I will wait for your answer
[07:10] <mtx_init> leeping_: foremost wont find much more than getdataback, but its a try
[07:11] <leeping_> mtx_init, do you know if foremost tries to get the directories back too?
[07:11] <SpaceGhostC2C> DcMeese: because this is ubuntu, not debian support channel.
[07:11] <mtx_init> leeping_: it doesnt
[07:11] <DcMeese> SpaceGhostC2C: :) thanks
[07:11] <Sath> Ok, maybe I can approach this a different way. Someone else suggested that if I can't get this to work I can download a newer version and reformat?
[07:11] <SpaceGhostC2C> DcMeese: later friend.
[07:11] <mihir> hello friends
[07:11] <Nitrohax> ravibn> so when you click on the test button in the window you aren't seeing anythign but on other programs you are seeing stuff? and it's pointed at the right device? am i correct?
[07:11] <DcMeese> SpaceGhostC2C: Im not leaving lol
[07:11] <mtx_init> leeping_: its a forensics application, its there to look at descriptors of files rather than recover them.
[07:11] <mihir> how to open corel draw .cdr file in ubuntu Inkscape is not able to open cdr file is there any other way to open it
[07:12] <SpaceGhostC2C> DcMeese: I didn't say that, I said later as in I'm gonna do other things now. Later.
[07:12] <ravibn> Nitrohax : yes! your are correct
[07:12] <Nitrohax> ravibn> when did you download skype?
[07:12] <ravibn> nitrohax : from www.skype.com
[07:12] <DcMeese> SpaceGhostC2C: Oh. Lol. Ha. 0_O
[07:12] <Nitrohax> ravibn> when?
[07:13] <mtx_init> leeping_: gl im off to bed

[07:13] <mihir> how to open corel draw .cdr file in ubuntu Inkscape is not able to open cdr file is there any other way to open it
[07:13] <Nitrohax> ravibn> ok one sec more pelase
[07:13] <ActionParsnip> mihir: you may be able to get a plugin. I'd ask in inkscape. If its a proprietary format you may luck out
[07:14] <leeping_> mtx_init, thanks!
[07:14] <kosnick> i tried to upgrade my ubuntu istallation on my eeepc and seems like it stucked at the very end. it did downloaded all the packeges, it did installed them and then while "cleaning up" (less than one minute remaining - as it said) it stuck in "processing triggers for python support" . Any ideas what to do? (by the way i tried to ctrl-c and i got a message that if i do that i might leave the system broken and finally backed off.
[07:15] <Nitrohax> ravibn> i sent you a pm
[07:15] <mihir> how to open cdr format in ubuntu
[07:15] <ravibn> Nitrohax : What pm?
[07:16] <flukebox> Nitroxhax: what ?
[07:16] <Nitrohax> flukebox> nm you must not be a fan of fluke the band
[07:16] <flukebox> :P
[07:16] <flukebox> that must be the case
[07:17] <mihir> how to open corel draw file in ubuntu
[07:17] <kosnick> ok i just got a message to go on  ;)
[07:17] <SpaceGhostC2C> mihir: did you ask where another user told you to go ask?
[07:17] <Ten-Eight> mihir: from what I have been able to find, there is no way to open a .cdr file with Inkscape.
[07:18] <Nitrohax> ravibn> well since the private message (pm) isn't working. i would try to video chat with a skype user and see if they can see you. Seems more like a skype program glitch
[07:18] <timClicks> hi - is the new light theme available anywhere?
[07:18] <ravibn> Nitrohax : No ! I need it for video conf with my clients across globe
[07:19] <timClicks> I would like to experiment with it wihout trying the whole karmic beta
[07:19] <Ten-Eight> mihir: if a drawing created in coreldraw can be saved as .svg, then Inkscape should be able to open it as it deal with .svg quite nicely.
[07:19] <Nitrohax> ravibn> unless you want to tell me your skype number and or name here and i try to connect with you that's my solution. i think it's just skype not showing you the test picture. so test it on another user
[07:19] <SpaceGhostC2C> timClicks: karmic isn't in beta, Lucid is.
[07:19] <Ten-Eight> if someone else knows differently, please correct me.
[07:20] <ravibn> Nitrohax : sure my skype id ravi.kumar.b.n
[07:20] <nomad77> mihir: this may work or try the gimp http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=sk1
[07:20] <timClicks> SpaceGhostC2C: *facepalm*
[07:20] <ravibn> Nitrohax : can u give me your skype id pl
[07:21] <mihir> but in that case we need to embade image and it will almost turn out to be jpg file which cannot be ungrouped in inkskape

[07:22] <Ten-Eight> if the image can be saved as .svg in Coreldraw, Inkscape should be able to deal with it.
[07:22] <Nitrohax> ravibn> that was me calling, you need o try to turn on your webcam when i try again. i don't have a mic on this computer
[07:23] <s4aluck> do somebody knows how to edit the setings for tripwire???

[08:34] <cast> wolf89: backup your mbr then
[08:34] <KaV> hello fellows i have a question about an nics could you recommend any channel to ask ?
[08:34] <mrselfpwn> well, i haven't installed to harddisk though I would edit the backtrack install script and have it not run grub
[08:35] <almoxarife> wolf89: I am the guy who actually gave the key to my win7 install in virtualbox, then saw his real install ask for something he no longer had
[08:35] <mrselfpwn> then manually add backtrack with the proper settings to ubuntu's grub

[08:38] <mrselfpwn> wolf89: how do you plan on using something as cli intensive as backtrack, though are not able to figure that out?
[08:39] <CrustyBarnacle> Baloe4567: Try Karmic instead?
[08:39] <almoxarife> wolf89: do you have the ram to run one in virtual?
[08:39] <chelz> mrselfpwn: fatcake is using efi?
[08:39] <Baloe4567> CrustyBarnacle thats the point it doesnt work .. seems like the netboot installer is bugged, but all the toturials speak fine of it
[08:39] <wolf89> almoxarife, yep..
[08:39] <mrselfpwn> wolf89: honestly, i haven't installed to harddisk, i would havve to look at it

[08:44] <ranjb> Hi can anyone help me with a 'grub loading' issue?
[08:45] <almoxarife> ranjb: lost it after update?
[08:46] <chelz> roughmouth: nvidia-settings should set things up pretty well
[08:46] <amani> i can play game on ubuntu or not?
[08:46] <ranjb> I have 2 laptops and on 1 laptop i have successfully installed 9.10 on the other one which is a same brand laptop but slightly higher spec. I can install but once it restarts all I get is 'grub loading' no other message. I have Windows 7 installed already on the laptop. Could this be the cause?
[08:47] <magn3ts> Sigh, is there a way in rhythmbox to get play counts of songs?>
[08:47] <ranjb> I have heard that I have to ensure that grub is installed on the ubuntu partition
[08:47] <chelz> amani: depends on the game. there are lots of games for linux but playing Windows games on linux can get tricky
[08:47] <roughmouth> i get this message when i try to save - Failed to parse existing X config file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf'!
[08:47] <ranjb> does anyone know how I do this. I was going to download gparted and run it on both laptops and see how each of the disks are setup and partitioned
[08:48] <brando753> is there any voting applications in ubuntu
[08:48] <chelz> ranjb: all you need is an ubuntu livecd. the livecd has parted on it as Partition Editor.
[08:48] <roughmouth> any idea chelz?
[08:48] <amani> game like nfs, hello etc
[08:48] <chelz> ranjb: try #2 here: http://ubuntuguide.net/how-to-restore-grub-2-after-reinstalling-windows-xpvistawin7
[08:49] <ranjb> so by default if i have dual booted the laptop and ubuntu is my second OS install where will it store grub? will it store this on a windows MBR?
[08:50] <chelz> roughmouth: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:50] <djdarkman> Hi, is there a way to change the order of the playlist columns in rythmbox?
[08:50] <djdarkman> the current order is very akward to me
[08:50] <chelz> ranjb: grub usually has its files on an ubuntu partition and installs another part to the root of a drive. it's much more reliable to have grub boot with the system rather than anything from microsoft
[08:51] <amani> where i foun the game for ununtu??
[08:51] <ranjb> ok that makes sense, I will have a look at the link you sent

[09:02] <roughmouth> that didnt work
[09:02] <roughmouth> :(

[09:06] <aurilliance> whenever I press ctrl+alt+f7 to come back to the desktop after using a tty shell, my netbook goes into suspend. Any ideas on how to stop this?
[09:06] <nibbler> fatcake: mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.old then restart
[09:06] <nibbler> fatcake: restart firefox, that is
[09:06] <Baloe4567> almoxarife Debian stable installed fine, Debian testing installed but i get kernelpanic after install and hardy gets me into the install screen fine.But karmic doesnt give me a install screen.Which is odd because i tried the HD-media one and CD one and those works perfectly only can use them to install
[09:06] <nibbler> Baloe4567: did you use alternate installer?
[09:06] <jastor> someone that knows a graphical filemanager (midnight commander style) that actually MOVES files? and not: copies them and when all the files are copied, deletes them
[09:07] <nibbler> jastor: midnight commander e.g.
[09:07] <Baloe4567> nibbler there is only one netboot installer
[09:07] <nibbler> Baloe4567: ah okay, sorry
[09:07] <Sensiva> Hello, I am using HTTrack, if I close its GUI, it will work in the background??
[09:08] <jastor> nibbler: well i said something like midnight commander ... except htat midnight commander is not what im after since it doesnt move files
[09:08] <ZachK_> Yo
[09:08] <nibbler> jastor: of course it moves files, thats why i recommended it. but pls mind that a real move is only possible when working on the same fs
[09:08] <almoxarife> nautilus moves
[09:09] <jastor> nibbler: midnight commanders idea of how to move a file is rather fcked up ... "hey lets copy the files from A to B .. and when all the files are copied, we delete them from A"
[09:09] <nibbler> jastor: not if you are on the same fs...
[09:09] <jastor> nibbler: its between disks ;)
[09:09] <nibbler> jastor: than how do you think it should be moved, if not copy+delete?
[09:10] <almoxarife> jastor: nautilus has a 'move script'
[09:10] <jastor> nibbler: copy file 1 from A to B, delete file 1 from a .. copy file 2 from A to B, delete file 2......
[09:10] <Baloe4567> Hmmm just tried the pxe on another pc .. it works fine there ... so it's not the installer
[09:10] <amani> ????????
[09:10] <nibbler> jastor: that makes such a big difference.....
[09:10] <jastor> nibbler: instead of copy n to b .. copy next to b .. copy next to b .. when all the files are copied, dlete from a
[09:10] <amol112> hi all,i don't know much modem configuration after search i got running #modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0451 product=0x6060 it detctects as /dev/ttyUSB0 but dont know how to configure it..

[09:11] <nibbler> jastor: i thinkg you wont find any application that does it differnt from nautilus/mc, they are all "rather *ed up"
[09:12] <jastor> nibbler: whatever moron thought it up like that anyway?
[09:12] <jastor> that instead of deleting the source file after each copy, delete them after all are copied
[09:13] <almoxarife> jastor: you have had way too much caffeine
[09:13] <jastor> almoxarife: nautilus .. isnt that a graphical one?
[09:13] <r43gh4r> hi... i have a Q.. can someone help me?
[09:13] <almoxarife> jastor: yes
[09:13] <mealstrom> nothing wake ups you better then a smell of burning server
[09:14] <jastor> almoxarife: X isnt installed ;)
=== tushar_ is now known as tushar
[09:14] <almoxarife> r43gh4r: ask
[09:15] <syrius> does smbmount give password over network in plaintext?
[09:15] <syrius> or does it encrypt it

[09:16] <shazbotmcnasty> GOD DAMNIT
[09:16] <shazbotmcnasty> passwrd
[09:16] <shazbotmcnasty> omg
[09:16] <nibbler> syrius: encrypt
[09:16] <shazbotmcnasty> I'm sorry
[09:16] <FloodBot3> shazbotmcnasty: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[09:16] <nibbler> syrius: but sniff it, if you want to know....
[09:16] <shazbotmcnasty> I'll just be going now, I thought i was in a different room.
[09:16] <syrius> it is encrypted
[09:16] <shazbotmcnasty> lol
[09:16] <syrius> hmm
[09:16] <r43gh4r> well... i installed ubuntu on toshiba satellite m100 laptop.... but the problem is that when i log in... it kind of freezes
[09:16] <syrius> how would I sniff it? nibbler
[09:17] <syrius> what tools would be the job for that?
[09:17] <syrius> I never tried it before
[09:17] <syrius> like wired share or something?
[09:17] <syrius> wird shark*
[09:17] <nibbler> syrius: wireshark or just ngrep
[09:17] <jastor> so .. anyone that knows a filemanager that moves files between disks like 99% of all the other does? (nortoncommander,norton commander 95,windows commander, total commander, etc.etc.etc.)
[09:17] <almoxarife> smbmount does plain text password
[09:18] <syrius> do you have link for this? almoxarife
[09:18] <zetheroo>  Does Ubuntu have any issues with being installed on an SSD?
[09:18] <syrius> on some site it says that modern windows doesn't accept plain text
[09:18] <almoxarife> http://linux.die.net/man/8/smbmount
[09:18] <duckwars> does anyone know if there is a media center type program that uses mplayer, or how I can force boxee or xbmc or moovida to use mplayer instead of whatever they use?
[09:18] <Dr_Willis_> jastor:  clarify what you mean
[09:19] <jastor> Dr_Willis_: midnight commander .. it moves files like "copy files from A to B .. when all teh files are copied, remove them from A"
[09:19] <Dr_Willis_> duckwars:  geexbox used mplayer. So i think its latest version 'enna' does also
[09:19] <n3k0rm> my speakers keep popping when playing sounds, especially when sound hasn't been played in a while. Using a fresh install of 64-bit 9.10
[09:19] <amol112> i am now clueless why my usb modem is not getting detected with linux
[09:19] <duckwars> thank you
[09:19] <jastor> Dr_Willis_: about all other filemanagers ive used "copy file 1 from a to b, dlete file 1 from a, copy file 2 from a to b, delete file 2 from , ......."
[09:19] <Dr_Willis_> jastor:  so? that may or may not be good. :) I tend to use mc for console and 'rox' for gui.
[09:20] <almoxarife> amol112: problem exists only after return from suspend?
[09:20] <amol112> almoxarife, no always problem exist
[09:20] <amol112> it got detected by kernel as /dev/ttyUSB0
[09:21] <jastor> Dr_Willis_: whatever its good or not im looking for a filemanager that does it like that
[09:21] <almoxarife> amol112: did it ever work?
[09:21] <amol112> but wvdialconf not detects it
[09:21] <amol112> almoxarife, yes
[09:21] <syrius> almoxarife, where does it say it sends it out in plaintext?
[09:21] <amol112> LED glows
[09:21] <syrius> all I see is this line
[09:21] <syrius> This is preferred over having passwords in plaintext in a shared file, such as /etc/fstab. Be sure to protect any credentials file properly.
[09:21] <syrius> I am not using /etc/fstab
[09:21] <syrius> to auto mount it
[09:22] <jastor> Dr_Willis_: i dont even see why midnight commander would go against the "file manager standards" when it comes to moving files
[09:22] <syrius> nibbler, how would I use ngrep?
[09:22] <zetheroo> Does Ubuntu have any issues with being installed on an SSD?
[09:22] <syrius> for that purpose
[09:22] <jastor> (filemaanger standards in this case would be what nc,nc95,windows commander, total commander etc.etc.etc. use)
[09:23] <fatcake> I'm sorry, I still can't get Firefox to even work.  I didn't quite understand what I was told to do to fix that.
[09:24] <Dr_Willis_> jastor:  its been around longer then most of the other file managers out. and it tried to clone the old 'norton commander' file manager that was out for dos AGES befor that
[09:24] <sreeju> i am new to ubuntu,can anyone tell me how to install packages downloaded from web
=== sash_ is now known as sash__
=== sash__ is now known as sash_
[09:24] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  what packages? Its best to use teh package manager
[09:24] <jastor> Dr_Willis_: i just mentioned norton commander
[09:25] <sreeju> i mean softwares
[09:25] <anirban> i got broken pak while try to install vlc,     i update the packge list but no luck......help plzz?
[09:25] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  yes.. we know you mean software.. what software?
[09:25] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  do you mean .deb files or somthign else?
[09:26] <jastor> Dr_Willis_: you just lectured me up on filemanagers :D stating norton commander was the first one ... and yet missed that when i said nc didnt know that nc is norton commander?
[09:26] <sreeju> while iam downloading anything from web they are not giving .deb file
[09:26] <almoxarife> syrius: By default, Samba uses plaintext passwords to authenticate clients who access network resources. Samba also supports the use of LanManager- and NT-encrypted password authentication.rd ????? http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2717
[09:26] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  it all depends on exactly what it is.. and who is doing the packageing.
[09:26] <sreeju> they are giving some tar.bz file etc
[09:26] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  thats just a generic 'archive' extension.
[09:27] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  so what IS it you are trying to install exactly?
[09:27] <anirban> i got vlc: Depends: vlc-nox (= 1.0.2-1ubuntu2.1) but 1.0.4-1~getdeb1 is to be installed in error
[09:27] <sreeju> ok after extracting iam getting more files
[09:27] <r43gh4r> can anyone hlp me pls
[09:27] <sreeju> what should i do with it to install
[09:27] <Dr_Willis_> anirban:  you got the getdeb repos enabled. and they are confliucting. You may want to  remove it
[09:28] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  we cant say.. untill you tell us EXACTLY what it is you are messign with.
[09:28] <timClicks> hi - is the new light theme available anywhere? i would like to try the lucid look and feel without installing the whole beta
[09:28] <almoxarife> anirban: did you try to 'repair' via synaptic?
[09:28] <sreeju> i have down loaded kmplayer from the web and i have to install it
[09:28] <Dr_Willis_> timClicks:  theres theme downloads for that - at various ubuntu news sites. OMGubuntu I think has them. as does that webup8 site
[09:28] <anirban> almoxarife geting same error in syna ..but in gui mode
[09:29] <Baloe4567> almoxarife can grub 2 from previous install block pxe ?
[09:29] <timClicks> Dr_Willis_: ty
[09:29] <jastor> Dr_Willis_: so .. you have no idea then i guess
[09:29] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  seeif they got debs. for starters.. and i belive that tool may be avail in some PPA repositories
[09:29] <Baloe4567> almoxarife nvm it works lol
[09:29] <anirban> i use sudo apt-get install vlc
[09:29] <Dr_Willis_> jastor:  i cant even rember what we were talking about. Ive been helping in other channels
[09:30] <jastor> and im damn interested to know when i ask for something OTHER than midnight commander. . i get midnight commander as an answer?
[09:30] <jastor> heh ... youve smoked way too much crack
[09:30] <Dr_Willis_> jastor:  i recall some other console based file managers in the repos. but ive rarely used them
[09:30] <almoxarife> Baloe4567: I know this about grub2, it crashes on wubi installs after updates, there is a fix, I am wondering if the same problem you have is associated with it, the crashes are on wubi installs
[09:31] <sreeju> whatever i am downloading from web is not in .deb format they are some source codes how can i install them
[09:31] <Dr_Willis_> jastor:  theres also numerous 2 pane file managers out like 'gentoo' 'filerunner'  and proberly a dozen others that i cant rember
[09:31] <anirban> Dr_Willis i got it ...i remove vlc-nox  and then try to install vlc againg ..now its woeking
[09:31] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  compiling from source is going tobe a rather large undertaking for a linux beginner.
[09:31] <Dr_Willis_> !source
[09:31] <ubottu> You can easily fetch a package's source with apt-get. See: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html

[09:32] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  you would have better luck finding a PPA repoistory for unofficial/new packages
[09:32] <jastor> Dr_Willis_: filerunner is for x
[09:32] <Dr_Willis_> jastor:  its an old 2 pane file manager with GUI written in TCL. :)
[09:32] <sreeju> sorry i didn't get you
[09:32] <Dr_Willis_> madeit very easy to 'tweak'
[09:32] <Dr_Willis_> !ppa
[09:32] <almoxarife> sreeju: I learned how to install from source using 'check-install', much simpler and saner way to do it
[09:32] <ubottu> With Launchpad's Personal Package Archives (PPA), you can build and publish binary Ubuntu packages for multiple architectures simply by uploading an Ubuntu source package to Launchpad. See https://help.launchpad.net/PPAQuickStart.
[09:33] <jastor> Dr_Willis_: ok .. i only saw it said for X
[09:33] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  you may want to search  for whatever it is you are trying to compile and 'ubuntu ppa' and see if there exists a PPA for it.

[09:40] <almoxarife> Lanthes: you behind a firewall?
[09:40] <tushar> like 3d and all
[09:40] <embrik> Is it possible to have the on-screen keyboard activated in a gnome session?
[09:40] <Aciid> jastor: mc has progress bar for move and cp
[09:40] <Lanthes> almoxarife: dont know am I i just fix the wireless problem and now have this problem
[09:40] <jastor> Aciid: I KNOW
[09:41] <fatcake> What is mv?
[09:41] <embrik> tushar: administration, synaptic.... searc for compiz-fusion, install
[09:41] <jastor> BUT MIDNIGHT COMMANDER .. doesnt move files the normal way
[09:41] <duckwars> so I tried enna, but it doesn't work (not exactly sure why), but anyway, are there any other media centers that use mplayer?

[09:42] <jastor> Aciid: instead of deleting every source file after each copy ... it deletes them AFTER every copy is done
[09:42] <embrik> how can I activate on-screen keyboard in a gnome session, without a keyboard, just using the mouse
[09:42] <almoxarife> Lanthes: then the wireless works, but you can't browse the web?
[09:43] <Dr_Willis_> This silly keyboard has a  big enter key where im used to the | key heh..  i keep miss hitting the | :)

[09:58] <maxorator> ati hd 3850
[09:58] <raquelilla> olaaa
[09:58] <maxorator> just installed the latest drivers today, it didn't improve anything
[09:59] <overmind> !es | raquelilla
[09:59] <ubottu> raquelilla: En la mayoria de canales de Ubuntu se habla solo en ingles. Si busca ayuda en espanol o charlar entra en el canal #ubuntu-es. Escribe "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y dale a enter.
[09:59] <twright> maxorator: is that the propitiatory ati driver then?
[09:59] <Lanthes> Is there anyone can help me why I cant connect to MSN or Google.com
[09:59] <raquelilla> no se inglesssssss
[09:59] <overmind> raquelilla: Entonces ve a #ubuntu-es
[09:59] <maxorator> twright, what do you mean?
[10:00] <maxorator> I just downloaded it from the ATI website and ran
[10:00] <twright> maxorator: Ah right, did you have this issue with the driver installed by default?
[10:01] <Ashok> how to create graphical user account in ubuntu
[10:01] <Seveas> Ashok, system -> admin -> users & groups
[10:01] <mary__> Hello, I am using evolution and I have setup my gmail account for imap and on the left side it lists my account but the drop down triangle is unresponsive and it will not display my mail by clicking on the shown email address.
[10:01] <maxorator> I don't know, I don't remember when this lag started
[10:01] <mary__> Does anyone have any suggestions?
[10:01] <maxorator> I haven't used ubuntu for a long time, had it on dual boot, just a few days ago I used it and noticed the lag
[10:02] <almoxarife> mary__: did you get to the password prompt?
[10:03] <mary__> well at one point i did and i deleted and tried to setup a new account but since i have set up a new account it has not asked for the password
[10:03] <Ashok> Seveas: no im not able to create tat add user is not wrkin r sth
[10:03] <mary__> it says scanning for new messages and reaches 100% but is still unresponsive
[10:03] <Seveas> Ashok, eh? I don't understand a word of that... try english...
[10:04] <almoxarife> mary__: did you set up the imap  and smtp ports for gmail correctly?
[10:04] <twright> maxorator: if it is a new lag then you might want to try the default driver instead - you can reset it using the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and start from there.
[10:04] <Ashok> Seveas: hey i am not able to create from what you said
[10:04] <Seveas> Ashok, what's the error you get?
[10:04] <mary__> almoxarife: i beleive so I just selected gmail then imap, interesting the drop down triangle just responded
[10:05] <Ashok> Seveas: that adduser button  is un sensitive i mean not responding at all
[10:05] <almoxarife> mary__: your gmail account is already setup for imap?
[10:05] <overburn> hello guys. anyone know how i can setup a network between kubuntu 9.10 and windows 7? i'm kinda lost at the ip configuration for the network adapter in kubuntu
[10:05] <Seveas> Ashok, isn't there an 'unlock' button?
[10:06] <mary__> almoxarife: it appears to be a problem with evolutions gui
[10:06] <maxorator> twright, do I have to restart?
[10:06] <twright> maxorator: yes
[10:06] <Spaceman> how do you show the list of other kernels during the start up?
[10:06] <almoxarife> mary__: nothing against evolution but I gave up on it and installed thunderbird
[10:06] <overburn> anyone?
[10:06] <mary__> the drop down triangle is very touchy, then when it opens and i click on inbox it acts as if i clicked to close the drop down triangle and pulls the list away
[10:07] <Ashok> Seveas: no man there is sth called as click to make chnages
[10:07] <twright> overburn: do you mean connection sharing
[10:07] <mary__> thanks for the suggestion
[10:08] <YSNESHY> ONDE ENCONTRO UM SERVIDOR COM MUITOS BRS ???
[10:08] <almoxarife> mary__: if you created a new account and you never got to the password login from google I don't think you talked to the imap server

[10:09] <ubottu> YSNESHY: Por favor, use #ubuntu-br para ajuda em portugues. Obrigado.
[10:09] <overburn> twright: erm yes. i have a kubuntu box with 2 nic's . one is connected to the net, the other is connected to a pc with windows 7
[10:09] <mary__> i guess since everything was exactly the same the old config was still in there
[10:09] <Seveas> Ashok, screenshot please :)
[10:09] <mary__> let me send a test email
[10:10] <Ashok> Seveas: hello tell me how to create user account
[10:10] <almoxarife> Seveas: nice to see someone who knows the diff between ES and PT/BR
[10:10] <overburn> twright: and i'm trying to be able to share stuff between then as well as share the net connection on the linux box
[10:10] <mary__> ]looks good i guess i will just have to deal with the skiddish gui
[10:11] <zongo_> cab anyone tell me if he has issue muting the internal speakers while jack connected and what would be the fix ?
[10:11] <Seveas> almoxarife, just did a whois on the ip address and it said .br :-)
[10:11] <overburn> twright: as well as share the keyboard and mouse using synergy
[10:11] <twright> overburn: right, sinergy and file sharing should be easy
[10:11] <almoxarife> Seveas: that works too :)
[10:11] <Dr_Willis_> Ashok:  'sudo adduser billgates'   is one way
[10:11] <Seveas> Ashok, please upload a screenshot of that dialog somewhere. I'm using a different version of Ubuntu and am a bit puzzled by what you say. Screenshots help debugging :)
[10:12] <overburn> twright: yes, but i'm lost on how to set the network adress on the linux box so the windows box would see it on the network
[10:12] <nishanth> does anyone know if there is a channel for compiz?
[10:12] <twright> overburn: this should help with the internet connection http://superuser.com/questions/5960/internet-connection-sharing-windows-vista-windows-7-or-windows-vista-ubuntu

[10:16] <artinstartin> after upgrading to the latest "update" the desktop is not visible anymore. the autostart programs run but there is no "system, places" and also no time visible just a blank screen in the purple colors of lucid lynx alpha3
[10:16] <artinstartin> whats th epropblem please
[10:16] <Seveas> Ashok, http://imagebin.org/index.php?page=add
[10:16] <twright> overburn: fairly in my experience - you could always just get an Ethernet switch quite cheaply
[10:16] <Seveas> artinstartin, gnome-panel was not started.
[10:16] <b33tfr33kr> artinstartin, you upgraded from alpha3, right? known bug.  wait a few and update from term
[10:16] <Ashok> Seveas: ya sure i will do it right now
[10:17] <artinstartin> Seveas: what do i have to do? recovery mode?
[10:17] <Seveas> artinstartin, or start gnome-panel. Is there anything in you autostart programs that can launch other programs?
[10:17] <overburn> twright: yeah but that would defeat my purpose of having to deal with scary stuff as a timewaster
[10:17] <artinstartin> b33tfr33kr: correct
[10:18] <Geograf> Hello from Ukraine
[10:18] <artinstartin> Seveas: i will check
[10:18] <artinstartin> cu later and thanblks
[10:18] <Penquite> Hi all, I don't know if anyone can help but I think an Apache update on my Ubuntu Server has just broken php. Instead of php scripts running they are just offered to you as a download. When I set the server up, I took the LAMP option, so I am not sure how to configure Apache to make php work again. Any hints would be gratefully received.
[10:18] <b33tfr33kr> hello Geograf
[10:19] <Ashok> Seveas: hey i uploaded check it
[10:20] <Seveas> Ashok, click the button with the keys on it. That asks for your password. After that you can add users.
[10:21] <hal> is there a way to move several screenlet widgets at once between workspaces?
[10:21] <Ashok> Seveas: but i don know that password
[10:21] <Seveas> Ashok, same password as what you use for logging in
[10:21] <Ashok> k wait i wil try
[10:22] <Seveas> Penquite, please pastebin the output of this command: ls -alR /etc/apache2
[10:22] <Ashok> Seveas: hey i got thanks very much
[10:22] <Seveas> Ashok, np, enjoy :)
[10:22] <HRH_H_Crab> ive just installed a dvb card in my karmic machine. after install i rebooted and confimred it was there with lspci. i then installed linux-firmware-nonfree and me-tv, rebooted and now the system wont boot. in recovery mode the machine gets to fsck, and then it just reboots itself.
[10:22] <Ashok> so now i can access root user also rite
[10:23] <Ashok> Seveas: can i access root user now
[10:23] <HRH_H_Crab> can anyone give me some troubleshooting advice? i guess i'm going to have to boot from a live cd?
[10:23] <Karti> Hi all, anyway to list complete directories and then send to .csv So far I have ls > directory.csv but it doesnt go down deep enough :)
[10:23] <Seveas> Ashok, yes, you can change things for root now

[10:25] <Seveas> Ashok, I think you can do that if you hit the properties button after selecting root, but I'm on lucid an that interface changed considerably so I'm not sure
[10:25] <b33tfr33kr> rocket16, nope, but plenty of cowboys (haha, jk)
[10:26] <Penquite> apologies, what do you mean by pastebin?

[10:27] <HRH_H_Crab> b33tfr33kr: well basically i can no longer boot. the last change i made was installing linux-firmware-nonfree / me-tv. since doing so it wont boot the kernel cant figure out why atm.
[10:27] <NetScr1be> anyone know anything about stopping false errors from palimpsest?
[10:27] <hal> is there a way to move several screenlet widgets at once between workspaces?
[10:28] <rocket16> Anyway, Kubuntu Network Manager is not a mess like Ubuntu 9.10's,
[10:28] <rocket16> So, when will be the Network Manager fixed?
[10:28] <NetScr1be> pastebinit not installed by default (on UNR anyway) use sudo apt-get install pastebinit to install
[10:28] <b33tfr33kr> HRH_H_Crab, yeah, at the very least you'll have to boot off a live cd. where does the boot sequence stop? can you tell?
[10:28] <b33tfr33kr> HRH_H_Crab, you have a live cd?
[10:31] <Penquite> Thanks all, http://paste.ubuntu.com/398253/
[10:31] <sqwertle> I'm curious; in certain channels whenever I try to say something I get "Cannot send to channel". Any idea as to what causes this?
[10:31] <HRH_H_Crab> b33tfr33kr: i have one somewhere.
[10:32] <HRH_H_Crab> atm im removing the dvb card.
[10:32] <HRH_H_Crab> it booted at least once since i installed it but i'll see what happens.
[10:32] <HRH_H_Crab> im sure i have a dvd somewhere
[10:32] <HRH_H_Crab> as for where it stops,
[10:32] <HRH_H_Crab> it seems to stop at 3 different places
[10:32] <Seveas> sqwertle, probably you need to register and identify before you can talk

[10:33] <HRH_H_Crab> one is early in the process where i see "[2.353992] Invalid checksum 0018"
[10:33] <Seveas> Penquite, looks like php5 has been disabled: sudo a2enmod php5; sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
[10:33] <HRH_H_Crab> or, it does a lot more udev stuff, then goes to fsck and reboots itself right after that (before giving results)
[10:34] <HRH_H_Crab> the third possibility is it will do that, confirm fsck was clean, and then mess around with ntp before rebooting itself.
[10:34] <HRH_H_Crab> :|
[10:34] <Seveas> HRH_H_Crab, looks like dodgy hardware. Boot into memdisk and let it run for a while
=== solid_liquid is now known as solid_liq
[10:35] <HRH_H_Crab> Seveas: ill try that if removing the dvb card doesnt work.
[10:35] <Ashok> Seveas: how to open root account graphically
[10:35] <Milp> is there any option for mount to print out more detailed stuff on how and why something went wrong?
[10:35] <solid_liq> Ashok, don't ;)
[10:35] <b33tfr33kr> HRH_H_Crab, yeah, sounds like you're on the right track with pulling that card.  i agree with the memdisk boot suggestion.
[10:35] <Seveas> Milp, look in /var/log/messages or the output of the dmesg command
[10:35] <Ashok> solid_liq: what
[10:35] <HRH_H_Crab> i did play with memtest for a while,
[10:36] <solid_liq> Ashok, you don't open root account graphically
[10:36] <HRH_H_Crab> but by the time it got to 2% passed i was bored and determined my memory must be 100% rock solid! ;)
[10:36] <Seveas> solid_liq, he means in the account editor :-)
[10:36] <solid_liq> oh
[10:36] <Ashok> solid_liq: why
[10:36] <solid_liq> heh
[10:36] <Seveas> solid_liq, are you on hardy? If so, please help Ashok. I'm on lucid and they changed that thing completely...
[10:37] <Ashok> solid_liq:tell me why man
[10:37] <Ashok> Seveas: tell me how to open root account graphically
[10:38] <Penquite> Seveas, thanks, but it failed with Cannot load /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so into server cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[10:38] <Seveas> Penquite, then php got removed. sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
[10:39] <Ashok> hello any one tell me how to open root account graphically im new to ubuntu
[10:39] <DaZ> Ashok: you don't want to do this.
[10:39] <Dr_Willis_> Ashok:  for what reason exactly?
[10:40] <b33tfr33kr> Ashok, he meant that you don't log into the graphical interface (gnome) with root. you sudo into it from a terminal
[10:40] <Dr_Willis_> biggest danger to a ubuntu system - is often the users doing things they shouldent be doing
[10:40] <Ashok> DaZ: y
[10:40] <Dr_Willis_> Ashok:  tell us exactly what task you are trying to preform
[10:40] <DaZ> Ashok: because only thing you gain from it is higher probability of crashing your system.
=== eric is now known as Guest8617
[10:41] <Ashok> Dr_Willis_: ist that possible atleast i want to know im new to ubuntu thats y
[10:41] <DaZ> Ashok: it is possible
[10:41] <b33tfr33kr> Ashok, it was decidedly removed as an option in ubuntu.  you can in, say, debian for example.  but it's too risky.
[10:41] <bazhang> Ashok, not support unsafe in the extreme
[10:41] <Dr_Willis_> Ashok:  use 'gksudo programname'
[10:41] <zetheroo> what is the key combination to hard restart from within Ubuntu?
[10:41] <DaZ> but needs gdm conf. file editing.
[10:41] <Dr_Willis_> Ashok:  if you want to ask a more clear/exacting question - please do so.
[10:41] <sreeju> i have downloaded kmplayer from the web please help to install it
[10:41] <DryGrain> you can open gnome-terminal graphically and sudo from there
[10:41] <DryGrain> does that count
[10:42] <HRH_H_Crab> well... surprise surprise removing the card has got it back to a desktop again, but since i booted once without problems and only ran into issues after installing that firmware package, i wonder. i think ill remove the firmware replace the card and see what happens...
[10:42] <Ashok> Dr_Willis_: fine what is root i am new to ubuntu
[10:42] <b33tfr33kr> HRH_H_Crab, haha, right on
[10:43] <chuchumaolu> how to use xchat
[10:43] <NetScr1be> you can also open a file browser as root
[10:43] <HRH_H_Crab> well, it could just be coincidence. this card has been stuck in a box for a good while maybe it only had one "good" boot in it.
[10:43] <NetScr1be> root = all-powerful superuser
[10:43] <bazhang> chuchumaolu, go to a different channel is /join #channelname
[10:44] <nmvictor> which package provides XVID MPEG 4 decoder and H.260 decoder in ubuntu?
[10:44] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  i see a 'kmplayer' repository/ppa  - but why are you even bothering with kmplayer? theres other players you can use.
[10:44] <Dr_Willis_> !root
[10:44] <ubottu> Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[10:44] <zetheroo>  what is the key combination to hard restart from within Ubuntu?.
[10:44] <nomad> how all where can i find where to add new gimp brushes?
[10:44] <Some_ux> heya
[10:44] <Dr_Willis_> zetheroo:  alt-ctrl-sysreq-k I think
[10:45] <Dr_Willis_> nomad:  on a per user basis. thers a .gimp dirctory I belive
[10:45] <sreeju> i want to study to install a package downloaded from web
[10:45] <Penquite> Seveas, php5 is now re-installed, and have restarted apache, but I am still getting offered my php scripts to download. Can you think of any other dependencies that I may have broken?
[10:45] <Some_ux> I need some help with my HDDs, Seems like my Raid 1 may have gone kaput. How do i run diagnostics if I can't boot the kernel ?
[10:46] <Dr_Willis_> sreeju:  you got a lot of learning to do.  and proberly 200mb+ of downloads to install befor you can compile from source
[10:46] <b33tfr33kr> Ashok, root is an account that has full file access permissions.  your user account, for example, cannot modify system components for security purposes
[10:46] <NetScr1be> sreeju what's after the. in the package name?
[10:46] <Dr_Willis_> kmplayer is just a very minimal front end to mplayer.
[10:46] <nomad> Dr_Willis_, I am going through finding a bunch from the net and kinda need a "usr,share" or something ,I know I can put them wherever I want but not advanced to do that w/o making system a wreck lol
[10:46] <Seveas> Penquite, run these commands and pastebin the output: dpkg -l '*apache*'; ls -laR /etc/apache; ps aux
[10:46] <sreeju> oh ho
[10:47] <Dr_Willis_> nomad:  when in doubt.. put stuff like thatin your users home. No need to clutter up the whole  system
[10:47] <zetheroo> This laptop screen here keeps blacking out when browsing in Firefox
[10:47] <zetheroo> very odd
[10:47] <zetheroo> the laptop is still on and the wifi is still working .. but the screen is just black
[10:47] <nomad> kk thanks ,then I can direct gimp to it if I remember right,right?
[10:47] <NetScr1be> penquite maybe your browser doesn't have the add-on to handle python scripts?
[10:47] <bazhang> chuchumaolu, next you want to go into preferences and choose how to highlight others; last spoken instead of alphabetical
[10:47] <zetheroo> it only happens when using Firefox
[10:47] <sreeju> the how can i get packages from web?
[10:47] <nmvictor> which package provides XVID MPEG 4 decoder and H.260 decoder in ubuntu?
[10:48] <NetScr1be> penquite browsers offer to download files they don't know how to handle otherwise
[10:48] <zetheroo> Dr_Willis_: not working for me
[10:48] <Dr_Willis_> nomad:  gimp has a setof dirs it keeps such in that it uses

[10:48] <chuchumaolu> first time chat this way
[10:48] <bazhang> chuchumaolu, if you type two or three letters then hit the tab key, it will complete the nickname, and the person can read what you are saying clearly
[10:48] <nomad> I am using something called swiftfox ,it is firefox but made for specific processor architecture and it seems good
[10:48] <Dr_Willis_> nmvictor:  install ubuntu-restricted-extras for starters..
[10:48] <bazhang> chuchumaolu, so for you I type chu <tab> and it becomes chuchumaolu
[10:49] <HRH_H_Crab> b33tfr33kr: removed the firmware and me-tv, rebooted, all good. @_@
[10:49] <Some_ux> How do i run diagnostics on my Raid if I can't boot ?
[10:49] <HRH_H_Crab> oh well.
[10:49] <HRH_H_Crab> (after replacing the card that is)
[10:49] <NetScr1be> Some_ux: boot from liveCD or SysResc
[10:49] <nomad> Dr_Willis, are you familiar with the conduit toolbar making website?
[10:50] <nomad> I have java and flash and I cannot get the media player in the toolbar I made showing up ion ubuntu
[10:50] <Some_ux> Once I boot from the LiveCD, how do i run diagnostics ?
[10:50] <zetheroo> any ideas?
[10:50] <bazhang> chuchumaolu, you also likely want to register your nickname if not done so, and then put the nickname:yourpass in the server field
[10:50] <Penquite> NetScr1be, I thought it would be that the server should be running the script and the browser should not need to know about it, but I am using Namoroka firefox pre-release. Have also tried firefox on a mac and also opera
[10:51] <chuchumaolu> i try what you told me
[10:51] <bazhang> chuchumaolu, try highlighting me  type baz then hit tab key

[10:53] <chuchumaolu> bazhang, isn't like this time
[10:54] <bazhang> chuchumaolu, nicely done; you may also want to edit your favorite channels, so you join them at startup
[10:54] <ranjan> can any body on the network can help me with fixing the correct display with the battery status on my  hp mini .. it is not giving correct information .. any help would be of great help ......
[10:55] <NetScr1be> how do we stop join/quit messages?
[10:55] <bazhang> chuchumaolu, this is done by choosing network list under Xchat menu item, then hitting edit for Ubuntu (freenode server) ; you type in the channels thus:  #channel1,#channel2,#etc
[10:55] <bazhang> NetScr1be, what client
[10:55] <chuchumaolu> bazhang, how to edit channel

[11:50] <SpiKeCy> @erUSUL : it says no wireless extensions

[11:51] <shazbotmcnasty> I don't know what btopenzone is
[11:51] <shazbotmcnasty> but if you've got a wireless router you would have to do to that config page and change your passkey
[11:51] <shazbotmcnasty> that is not within ubuntu
[11:51] <SpiKeCy> my bad, there is for wlan0, but there's nothiong for eth0
[11:51] <DelphiWorld> erUSUL: no, you're realy smart, i prefer it in order to by simple and accessible

[12:24] <orb01> Hi, I have some problems with my sound on 9.10. I just updated to KDE 4.4 via backports, and initially my sound stopped working. It unmuted some channels, and I get sound in Flash, VLC, Dragon Player and through aplay, but testing my soundcard in System Settings doesn't work, and neither does Amarok.
[12:25] <jrib> wojtek: so now you will stop speaking polish here?
[12:25] <Wasgood> jrib: I'm getting sick of using ubuntu :D
[12:25] <orb01> Amarok error in debug mode is: Cannot find demultiplexer plugin for MRL. I have deleted my catalog.cache file for xine as recommended, but that does not help.
[12:25] <nmvictor> is their ubuntu for swahili?
[12:26]  * khalil walks into the room

[12:26] <jrib> Wasgood: what partition is windows installed on?
[12:26] <khalil> Can anyone help?
[12:26] <Time`s_Witness> hum. how to fix sound problems?
[12:26] <Wasgood> jrib: /dev/sda1
[12:26] <orb01> Never mind, it did work. Removing catalog.cache solved my problem for both Amarok and the System Settings testing interface.
[12:26] <arand> !sound | Time`s_Witness
[12:26] <ubottu> Time`s_Witness: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

[12:27] <arthur_> question run a 32bit or 64bit os?

[12:27] <overmind> Wasgood: sans and monospace
[12:27] <jrib> Wasgood: add "makeactive" to the windows stanza in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[12:28] <nmvictor> ShadeS: what? my query about ubuntu for swahili?I am a kenyan, dont i have a right to query if my national language is supported in freenode or ubuntu IRCs?
[12:28] <orb01> arthur_: if your hardware is 64-bit then run the 64-bit version of the OS.
[12:28] <Wasgood> jrib: sorry where?
[12:28] <khalil> I need help
[12:28] <Wasgood> jrib: just under chainloader?
[12:28] <jrib> Wasgood: at the bottom of your file, above "savedefault", add "makeactive"
[12:28] <ShadeS> well I was curious if that language was just clicks and whistles
[12:28] <ShadeS> because I know there is a language like that
[12:29] <AceKing> Is there a way to do an upgrade from Live CD? The reason I am asking is because my brother has 9.04 installed on his laptop. He went to start the other day and after the grub menu he just got lines across the screen and couldn't do anything. I've been working on this for 3 days
[12:29] <orb01> nmvictor: your question would be answered by a simple Google search. Please don't waste our time if you can find the answer yourself.
[12:29] <khalil> I have vista on an internal drive and ubunutu on an external hdd
[12:29] <wojtek> how can i get to diffrent servers like pl ubuntu?
[12:29] <aurilliance> my webcam in xp required me to enable it via a software button (Ie I have no Function+SomeKey button to toggle the webcam enabled/disabled). How can I enable my webcam now that I'm in linux???
[12:29] <Wasgood> It's not letting me edit the file jrib
[12:29] <Time`s_Witness> lets suppose that volume control is disabled and that i have read nearly all sound topics from ubuntu forums. is there any hope but to uninstall the OS?
[12:29] <Wasgood> jrib: I don't have permission
[12:29] <khalil> I want to boot windows but it dosen't show up on grub2
[12:29] <jrib> Wasgood: type: gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[12:29] <orb01> AceKing: look for a guide on Google on how to reinstall Grub from the Ubuntu live CD
[12:29] <Time`s_Witness> in fact before reading the forums i had less problems than after
[12:30] <Time`s_Witness> because sound still worked, just that i had no volume control
[12:30] <AceKing> orb01, but why would I need to reinstall grub?
