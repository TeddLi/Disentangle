[21:57] <al__> do I need to manually do wpa_supplicant things in 9.10 or does network manager automatically handle that?

[22:01] <BORJS> Hello
[22:01] <jhb1608> I can boot Gparted
[22:01] <sebsebseb> jhb1608: better to have Windows installed first,  since otherwise  setting up Grub to work properly again can be a right issue
[22:01] <Seveas> hi BORJS, how can we help you?
[22:01] <jhb1608> and adjust it but I want to ask first.
[22:01] <arand> Goliath: Integrity chekc you mean, I don't think so, only way to know if you have the md5, which I assume not..
[22:01] <al__> Seveas, it's a Netgear WG311v2 which has a native ACX111 driver but that doesn't support WPA so I'm using the windows driver and ndiswrapper - which appears to be mostly working (can see networks) but just can't connect - I get the invalid cmd 12 error as mentioned in the topic I just linked
[22:02] <jhb1608> aha thought so

[22:05] <SpaceGhostC2C> Myrtti, what does that mean?
[22:05] <iceroot> SpaceGhostC2C: caps, the strange string in the message, the content... everything
[22:05] <Myrtti> SpaceGhostC2C: do you see him talking?
[22:05] <SpaceGhostC2C> Myrtti, not after his last message. :)
[22:06] <erUSUL> jp--: not a good idea. libc is the central library of linux systems. messing with it is dangerous
[22:06] <SpaceGhostC2C> Myrtti, I was talking to iceroot to tell him to be a bit more specific about what he's letting people know what to stop doing.

[22:06] <mikobuntu> c3l,   extract the lmms-0.4.6 file to your home directory, then open the terminal and paste this    cd lmms-0.4.6 && mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ && make && sudo make install

[22:21] <Nibz> I installed with qubi
[22:21] <erUSUL> Nibz: and the file is still in the windows drive?
[22:21] <Nibz> qubi

[22:21] <Nibz> the files are all there
[22:21] <Malmis> i can boot it as a live cd from nfs, but not accessing casper-rw
[22:21] <abstrakt> aight so how do I go about getting my wireless to work. the ubuntu software manager told me to install the BCM drivers for my Dell 1490 WLAN card and it "appears" to work, e.g. when i flick the physical switch on my laptop wireless card to the "on" position, i do get an "enable wireless" checkbox when I right click the network connection icon on the panel
[22:21] <abstrakt> but i don't get any autodetected networks
[22:21] <erUSUL> !wubi | Nibz see the wiki page it has a lot of info
[22:21] <ubottu> Nibz see the wiki page it has a lot of info: Wubi is an Ubuntu installer for Windows users that allows you to install and uninstall Ubuntu like a Windows application, in a simple and safe way. http://wubi-installer.org/support.php and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide for troubleshooting.

[22:21] <Nibz> I have spent the last 6 hours trying to fix the problem
[22:21] <erUSUL> Nibz: i never used wubi so i can not help further sorry
[22:22] <abstrakt> and when i try to set up a network manually the apply button stays ghosted/grayed out so I can't do anything

[22:25] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: -L/usr/local/lib for example or the correct configuration, is your dynamic linker setup to look in /usr/local/lib ?

[22:26] <Glowball> I'm looking for sun-java6-jdk, but I can't find it in synaptic anymore... (Somebody confirmed me it was in there with that name before), was it renamed?
[22:26] <lobo_tuerto> ikonia: this is part of the command: gcc -shared  -L/usr/local/lib
[22:26] <erUSUL> !info sun-java6-jdk | Glowball
[22:26] <SpaceGhostC2C> GhostWolf, does this interfere with anything?
[22:26] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: looks like it's looking in the right place, why is ruby in /usr/local/lib, it's normally in /usr/lib on an ubuntu install
[22:26] <ubottu> Glowball: sun-java6-jdk (source: sun-java6): Sun Java(TM) Development Kit (JDK) 6. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 6-15-1 (karmic), package size 18087 kB, installed size 56628 kB (Only available for all amd64 i386 lpia ia64)
[22:26] <SpaceGhostC2C> slowbottu.
[22:26] <dabaR> Nibz: and what have you tried so far? You might want to type it all out into a pastebin, so you can reuse it if noone can help you now, so you don't have to type it over and over
[22:26] <Nibz> ill check that arand
[22:26] <erUSUL> Glowball: maybe you need to enable multiverse? (weird it is disables though)
[22:27] <lobo_tuerto> ikonia: when I compiled and installed ruby 1.9, I decided to put it in my /usr/local since I installed it manually
[22:27] <tessarakt> Hi!
[22:27] <GhostWolf> SpaceGhostC2C, not that im aware of i just know people who add me or i added after i got amsn looks like that i just don't like it it, its a bit annoying to me
[22:27] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: ok, so it's because you've compiled it manually, that makes sense
[22:27] <tessarakt> what do I have to do on a 64bit machine to be able to run 32bit programs?
[22:27] <tessarakt> e.g. downloaded Firefox
[22:27] <Glowball> erUSUL: I'll have a look..
[22:27] <SpaceGhostC2C> GhostWolf, interesting. I don't know what it is for exactly.
[22:27] <SpaceGhostC2C> tessarakt, sudo apt-get instal ia32-libs
[22:27] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: surprised it's causing you a problem if you're saying -L/usr/local/lib
[22:28] <tessarakt> thx
[22:28] <Daughain> What app did I lose if nautilus tells me "There is no application installed for executable files"?
[22:28] <GhostWolf> SpaceGhostC2C, me neither i think its something that showing me someone didn't add me
[22:28] <Nibz> Dabar I have tryed everything on that site you gave me
[22:28] <tessarakt> I searched for x86
[22:28] <lobo_tuerto> ikonia: maybe I need to rename that /usr/local/lib/libruby19-static.a to something else? so it can find it as -lruby19
[22:28] <SpaceGhostC2C> GhostWolf, possible.
[22:28] <tessarakt> and 32 was a bit too generic
[22:28] <Daughain> And/or how do I find out?
[22:28] <Glowball> erUSUL: It's disabled indeed. Quite strange I *do* find the jre...
[22:28] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: no, you shouldn't need to rename it, that's fine,....ahh wait

I understand being asked for a password for the backend and to login but I have never seen it on the frontend. Thanks
[22:28] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, it's not associated with the files, you might not have lost a application, just the association.
[22:28] <ikonia> Goliath: what's that for ?
[22:29] <tessarakt> 2 more minutes and I have my beloved Thunderbird3 back ...
[22:29] <Goliath> ikonia: wrong paste
[22:29] <ikonia> Goliath: no problem
[22:29] <GhostWolf> but SpaceGhostC2C i know those people added me so i dunno even one person added me when i had to use my windows machine for a while cause i was on dial up

[22:29] <lo127> anyone know if it is possible to configure a vpn connection in network manager and then start/stop it from the terminal?
[22:29] <codenamenos> hey i want to copy the whole website of lyrics any idea how to do that. using ubuntu 9.10
[22:29] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: How do I reset the association?
[22:29] <dabaR> Nibz: hey, when did I give you a site?
[22:30] <Nibz> Dabar: Few min ago https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/477104?comments=all
[22:30] <dabaR> that was someone else.
[22:30] <lobo_tuerto> ikonia: ohhh :O  do you know what do I need to do for it got generate the shared ones? (or do I need to go google it?) :)
[22:30] <Nibz> Dabar: My bad
[22:30] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: need to recompile ruby, look for the shared libs options
[22:30] <Nibz> Dabar: But I have tryed everyone on that site.
[22:30] <al__> Seveas, looks like I'm affected by this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ndiswrapper/+bug/459716
[22:30] <dabaR> Nibz: so you just installed ubuntu using wubi. You can not boot into it, right?
[22:30] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: you could just link it against ruby supplied with ubuntu
[22:31] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, I'm looking it up.
[22:31] <Nibz> dabar: Yes I can boot the first time but not have I update
[22:31] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: Thanks.
[22:31] <al__> Seveas, do you have WPA working using ndiswrapper in 9.10 - and if so did you have to do your own build or is there another (less scary) way?
[22:31] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, here is one answer, but I remember seeing something better.
[22:31] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, http://techntools.vox.com/library/post/changing-file-associations-in-ubuntu-is-as-easy-as-cake.html
[22:31] <dabaR> Nibz: so, you installed, it worked, you updated and it does not work any more?
[22:31] <Seveas> al__, I don't. I've used intel hardware for years, no problems at all :)
[22:31] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: Cool, thanks. =)
[22:31] <al__> Seveas, heh
[22:32] <Nibz> Dabar: Correct is on boot it brings me the grub promt
[22:32] <lobo_tuerto> ikonia: I already did sudo apt-get build-dep ruby1.8 ruby1.9
[22:32] <lobo_tuerto> ikonia: thought that would take care of that
[22:32] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: not if the build options are static
[22:33] <al__> Seveas, though getting the latest code and rebuilding it I guess wouldn't help if the bug itself isn't fixed - or am I missing something?
[22:33] <dabaR> Nibz: and what did you try on the prompt?
[22:33] <lobo_tuerto> ikonia: lol, I just solved my problem
[22:33] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: ooh, cool, do tell
[22:33] <Seveas> al__, if upstream hasn't fixed the bug tht will indeed not help
[22:33] <gslauen> I have just installed mythbuntu 9.10 and I am having an odd problem. In the frontend I am being asked for a password to change settings under utilities/settings. I have never seen this before. Can anyone help me with this or tell me where to find or change this password. Is this a bug? Thanks
[22:33] <lobo_tuerto> ikonia: you know what I did? renamed libruby19-static.a to libruby19.a
[22:33] <lobo_tuerto> and it succesfully compiled and installed
[22:33] <lobo_tuerto> my ruby-opengl :)
[22:34] <Nibz> Dabar: linux/boot/vml... root=/dev/sda2 loop=/ubuntu/disks/roo.disk ro >initrd /boot/init... >boot
[22:34] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: and it's linked against the static libary ?
[22:34] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: didn't think that would work as the gcc line you've shown me was using -shared
[22:34] <codenamenos> i want to copy whole website of lyrics any idea how i gonna do that?
=== sekrit is now known as charitwo
[22:34] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: Ok.....What app do I need to associate an exe file with?
[22:34] <lobo_tuerto> ikonia: yeah, me too, but it did... I will run the samples to check everything is alright
[22:34] <SpaceGhostC2C> codenamenos, maybe you should look up wget. man wget is the command.
[22:34] <dabaR> Nibz: Do you know that /dev/sda2 is correct?
[22:34] <pH_> hey guys
[22:34] <GhostWolf> so no one else would know the problem with amsn that has an x inside a circle?
[22:34] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, depends, is it a windows app you want to run?
[22:34] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: be interesting to see if it's stable, nice spot though
[22:34] <FireCrotch> Does anyone know if there's a way to make google chrome use your window manager's theming?
[22:35] <pH_> guys, any idea about how can I mount a dvd on my windows and read it from my netbook?
[22:35] <pH_> remote dvd stuff
[22:35] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: No, linux app. windows I know what to link it to. =)
[22:35] <trism> GhostWolf: the amsn faq says that the person does not have you in their contact list
[22:35] <Nibz> dabar: Yes I do
[22:35] <ikonia> pH_: you'd have to share your dvd drive on windows, it will be slow though
=== codenamenos is now known as codename09
[22:35] <FireCrotch> Oh pffft, nevermind, I didn't look well enough
[22:35] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, are you sure it's a linux app? .exe is usually windows..
[22:36] <GhostWolf> trism well i know they do, cause they added me on the normal msn when i had to use windows on dial up
[22:36] <trism> GhostWolf: a forum post I found said this could be for 3 reason, the user removed you, didn't add you yet, or it is a bug with the server and they really do have you
[22:36] <lobo_tuerto> ikonia: well, the chingu's game samples run just good, thanks for your support :)
[22:36] <ikonia> lobo_tuerto: you fixed it yourself, well dont "yourself"
[22:37] <Nibz> dabar: still there?
[22:37] <GhostWolf> trism, well its mainly the 3rd option.. i know for a fact the person added me cause i accepted it when i was on my windows comp before i could get dsl back
[22:37] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: Yes, I just write it that way, since I dont actually know what file extension linux apps use.
[22:37] <dabaR> Nibz: yes. A couple of people say they can manually boot.
[22:37] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, linux isn't dependent on a file extiension
[22:38] <Daughain> Oi....
[22:38] <Nibz> Dabar: With the same thing I typed to you?
[22:38] <Daughain> Its unetbootin for linux.
[22:38] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, I'd rename the file to just the name or something you want.
[22:38] <pH_> ikonia: how
[22:38] <pH_> ?
[22:38] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, so when you downloaded it, what was it's name?
[22:38] <ikonia> pH_: the guys in ##windows will tell you how to share your cd drive, you then need to use "samba" on linux to mount it
[22:38] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: unetbootin-linux-393
[22:38] <mtrg> what's the best media server for playihg HD 5.1 1080p/i moivies
[22:39] <SpaceGhostC2C> then all you should need to do is chmod +x unetbootin-linux-393 and then ./unetbootin-linux-393
[22:39] <ikonia> mtrg: the client is what matters
[22:39] <GhostWolf> ok anyways thanks for the problem guys have a nice weekend
[22:39] <dabaR> Nibz: ya, looks like.
[22:39] <Nibz> Dabar: What is /dev
[22:39] <dabaR> As in here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/477104/comments/18
[22:39] <SpaceGhostC2C> ikonia, but don't some servers have better features, like on the fly transcoding?
[22:39] <pH_> ikonia: do you know any tut?
[22:40] <Nibz> Dabar: I know for a face that sda2 is correct but im not sure about /dev
[22:40] <dabaR> Nibz: it is where file nodes
[22:40] <mtrg> ikonia: my client is an xbox360, connected to Harman/Kardon AVR with 5.1 setup, and a 1080i screen
[22:40] <ikonia> SpaceGhostC2C: it doesn't matter if he's serving files
[22:40] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: Ummmm....What does that do?? I dont care what it is called, I need to find out how to make it run. =)
[22:40] <ikonia> mtrg: so you're using upnp
[22:40] <SpaceGhostC2C> ikonia, good point.
[22:40] <dabaR> Nibz: it is where "file nodes" for devices go.
[22:40] <Nibz> Dabar: Then Yes it should work
[22:40] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, that makes it executable and then runs it.
[22:40] <dabaR> Nibz: in Unix, everything is a file, even a device - you read from it, and write to it
[22:40] <mtrg> ikonia: i thought upnp is for auto configuring NAT on routers
[22:40] <Nibz> Dabar: I have the correct partition selected
[22:40] <dabaR> Nibz: how do you know sda2 is good?
[22:40] <ikonia> mtrg: no,
[22:40] <SpaceGhostC2C> !info udev | Nibz
[22:40] <ubottu> Nibz: udev (source: udev): rule-based device node and kernel event manager. In component main, is important. Version 147~-6.1 (karmic), package size 420 kB, installed size 1432 kB
[22:41] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: And, last time I tried playing in term, I lost these associations and crashed dolphin.
[22:41]  * dabaR thinks SpaceGhostC2C is cute
[22:41] <Daughain> OK, I'll give it a try. =)
[22:41] <ikonia> mtrg: I'm asking as you'll need a client that's compatible with your server, so it depends what servers the xbox can use, hence why I was wondering if you where using upnp
[22:41] <mtrg> ikonia: do you recommend any upnp streaming server, that supports WMA HD 5.1 streaming?
[22:41] <Nibz> dabar: I intstalled it on my second partiton or my d:/ drive so it should be 2
[22:42] <ikonia> mtrg: the streaming isn't important - it's just a file. It's more important that the client can deal with the encoding and is compatible with the server
[22:42] <dabaR> I've seen hda2
[22:42] <dabaR> I think it is the diff between sata and ide drives
[22:42] <rambo298>  i get authentication failed over and over at spash login; this is after ldap was installed now i am trying to recover. i've reset my password with grub recovery mode, but i still get authentication failed over and over HELP!
[22:42]  * dabaR could be way off on this one
[22:42] <maddhat> sort of odd issue (in server 9.10), I can browse to a drive but the cmd "df" doesnt see it, nor does "ls /dev/sd*"
[22:42] <omenmaster> can some1 help - screen goes black while im using my laptop and it wont come back on forcing me to reboot. plz help and thanks in advance
[22:42] <mtrg> ikonia: encoding aka codecs?
[22:42] <SpaceGhostC2C> dabar are you replying to someone or asking a question?
[22:43] <ikonia> mtrg: a file is encoded with a "codec" if you want, if that's not compatible with the client, it won't matter
[22:43] <maddhat> anyone know how to get that drive to show up when i do df?
[22:43] <Nibz> Space: Hes talking to me
[22:43] <iceroot> rambo298: is pam set to only accept ldap or also local /etc/passwd? if not, set /etc/passwd also
[22:43] <ikonia> maddhat: mount it
[22:43] <mtrg> ikonia: right, that's why I said WMA HD
[22:43] <SpaceGhostC2C> dabaR, you should use the usernames to reply to someone. like everyone else is doing.
[22:43] <maddhat> ikonia: it must be mounted already.. as i said, i can browse to it
[22:43] <ikonia> mtrg: ok, so the server doesn't matter, it's just a file
[22:44] <Nibz> Dabar: Ok say it was hda2 Would dev will be the correct path
[22:44] <ikonia> maddhat: is it a samba mount by any chance ?
[22:44] <mtrg> ikonia: and that file must be encoded properly as WMA HD?
[22:44] <Nibz> space: He missed it once
[22:44] <rambo298> iceroot i removed pam (i think); if i edit /etc/passwd in recovery mode (root), and just delete my password between the ":" like i did with /etc/shadow, will that work?
[22:44] <ikonia> mtrg: yes
[22:44] <maddhat> ikonia: no, im browsing through term (ssh'd in)
[22:44] <mtrg> ikonia: good to know
[22:44] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: That got it, thanks again. =)
[22:44] <omenmaster> can some1 help - screen goes black while im using my laptop and it wont come back on forcing me to reboot. plz help and thanks in advance
[22:44] <mtrg> ikonia: I thought some servers are able to change encoding on the fly
[22:44] <iceroot> rambo298: i bet you dont removed pam, if so you have a big problem
[22:44] <ikonia> maddhat: show me the output of mount in a pastebin please
[22:45] <SpaceGhostC2C> Nibz, more than once. I wanted to know if he was the one having the problem or what he was talking about. I'm not attacking him, chill.
[22:45] <ikonia> mtrg: they sure can, but that's going to take a large ammount of resources
[22:45] <rambo298> iceroot what pkg can i install to get pam back?
[22:45] <mtrg> ikonia: any good names for such servers?
[22:45] <iceroot> rambo298: with what you think you have REMOVED pam?
[22:45] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, no worries mate, if you need more help let me know.
[22:45] <maddhat> ikonia: i cant mount it tho, its not showing up in dev
[22:45] <dabaR> SpaceGhostC2C: you are super cute.
[22:45] <Nibz> Spaceghostc2c: alright sorry
[22:45] <pH_> ok guys
[22:45] <ikonia> mtrg: I'm not aware of any as wmv is a propratary codec
[22:45] <pH_> dvd on windows is not being shered
[22:45] <pH_> shared
[22:45] <pH_> how do i get it from ubuntu?
[22:45] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: I always need help, I just need to find what I need help with next. =)
[22:46] <ikonia> maddhat: then you can't be browsing it
[22:46] <dabaR> Nibz: /dev is 99.9999999% correct. I would be super surprised if it was not.
[22:46] <rambo298> iceroot you assume i was thinking? i panicked when i couldn't login! i removed everything i installed with ldap, but i whacked the pam.d directory
[22:46] <maddhat> ikonia: like i said.. odd
[22:46] <SpaceGhostC2C> mtrg, here's a hint, see what clients you have available to you on your devices and then find a server compatible, not the otehr way around.
[22:46] <ikonia> maddhat: please show me the output of the command "mount" on it's own
[22:46] <SpaceGhostC2C> dabaR, what is that supposed to mean?
[22:46] <maddhat> ohh
[22:46] <Nibz> dabar: Ok great thanks so much for pointion out my stupid error I will try this But what happens when I do get it booted is it not going to presist with the sameproblem?
[22:46] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, well we're always here, and you can feel free to PM me anytime you need help.
[22:46] <dabaR> SpaceGhostC2C: You somehow come off as being a newcomer to the community, and very eager to help. I find it cute.
[22:47] <iceroot> rambo298: hm, use a live-cd or recovery console and check /var/log/auth.log
[22:47] <iceroot> rambo298: to see what is wrong
[22:47] <dabaR> Nibz: no, it could just as much not be the case that that is the problem.
[22:47] <rambo298> ok let me see; this is windows i will switch over and check brb
[22:47] <dabaR> But you gotta test that.
[22:47] <SpaceGhostC2C> dabaR, I'm not sure if you're being rude, but I think you are. I have been here for quite some time. The length doesn't matter, don't be insulting.
[22:47] <dabaR> SpaceGhostC2C: in other words, you remind me of me.
[22:48] <ikonia> guys, please drop it
[22:48] <Nibz> dabar: OK I will and get back to you on that. Thank you so much for the help.
[22:48] <iceroot> rambo298: you can understand german? i wrote an article about using ubuntu with ldap (and kerberos)
[22:48] <ikonia> it's a support channel, stick to it
[22:48] <Daughain> SpaceGhostC2C: You missed the fun when I set up lanboot on this system. =)
[22:48] <SpaceGhostC2C> Daughain, you should pm me to chat about things. Or we can go chat in #ubuntu-offtopic
[22:49] <rambo298> iceroot no i'd have to translate it; but i will try, what's the url for your article?  man did i screw myself big time with this one
[22:49] <Nozy> hmmm update to 9.10 from 9.04 am I going to cry =)
[22:50] <dabaR> Nozy: Maybe, maybe not. Are you prone to crying when there are problems with your computer?
[22:50] <ikonia> dabaR: stop it

[22:50] <ikonia> dabaR: the smart/be-littling problems
[22:50] <jage> OK, I am trying to run install.exe from a CD under Wine.  Put the CD in and it automounts under the name (/media/QWBASMM) but when I right click and choose Open with Wine, it gives me a Blocked: not marked as executable.  I've tried mounting the CD as mount -o exec, but it says it's read only.  What should I do?
[22:50] <helium3fusion> what is channel topic?
[22:50] <ikonia> helium3fusion: ubuntu support
[22:50] <dabaR> Nozy: no way it is going to make you cry, then.
[22:50] <ZykoticK9> conky appearing under desktop background wallpaper (i'm using Compiz to draw wallpaper instead of Nautilus), when i switch to 3d Cube I can see conky, the rest of the time not-so-much.  Any ideas?
[22:50] <iceroot> helium3fusion: ubuntu-support
[22:51] <helium3fusion> nice...
[22:51] <Nozy> dabaR:  thianks
[22:51] <dabaR> helium3fusion: you can send /topic as a message to the channel to see
[22:51] <SpaceGhostC2C> dabaR, do you mind not belittling other bro? It's rude and degrading.
[22:51] <dabaR> ikonia: ^ see how he thanked me?
[22:51] <ikonia> dabaR: it doesn't matter, you don't speak to people like that
[22:51] <dabaR> Like what?

[22:53] <rambo298> iceroot txs for the link; so the error is, surprise surprise, PAM pam_start: failed to initialize handlers could not open /etc/pam.conf; so what pkg can i install to get pam back?
[22:53] <iceroot> rambo298: in /etc/nsswitch.conf just set passwd, shadow and group to comvat
[22:54] <mengu> hi. how do i know if my vga driver is installed? if it is not installed, how can i install it?

[22:54] <mengu> i'm on 9.10
[22:54] <iceroot> rambo298: i dont know the packagename but dpkg-reconfigure thepackage-name-of-pame should be enough
[22:54] <jage> is there a way to set the execute permission bit on a CD?
[22:55] <rambo298> iceroot ok txs i'll try to find the pkg name
[22:55] <iceroot> rambo298: on jaunty, pam.conf is empty by default
[22:55] <m013> beeeeeetiiiis
[22:56] <rambo298> iceroot i'll be back, but i am sure it is because i whacked the pam directory and pam.conf in /etc ... bad move i know
[22:56] <SpaceGhostC2C> jage, it'd be only for the time it's mounted. I think so though.
[22:56] <mengu> anyone?
[22:56] <iceroot> rambo298: always create a file like pam.conf.old before doing changes
[22:56] <jage> i only need the execute bit for the install, so a mount is OK, but mount -o exec fails saying the CD is read only
[22:56] <rambo298> iceroot i think i should always think before i delete things ... that is the first step; gray matter first, fingers second!
[22:57] <iceroot> rambo298: that is a good start ;)
[22:57] <ZykoticK9> VCoolio, thanks for the suggestion - no dice unfortunately.  Tried with a different theme, which kills of Compiz's background altogether

[23:01] <ZykoticK9> jage, that's a windows program - i think everything from MS is set to executable...  you should probably be using something like "wine install.exe" instead

[23:01] <newfierich> at least my wireless drivers are installed..
[23:02] <iceroot> jage: wine file.exe  and not ./file.exe
[23:02] <SpaceGhostC2C> sebsebseb, about the !new factoid and the pocket book :P
[23:02] <jage> -r-------- 1 jage jage 14860 2000-08-03 16:57 install.exe
[23:03] <iceroot> jage: again, wine install.exe
[23:03] <newfierich> Does anyone have any idea why connection manager does not show any wireless connections but windows does? as far as a i can tell my network card is installed...
[23:03] <dc0m> newfierich: because it sucks.
[23:03] <sebsebseb> SpaceGhostC2C: ok
[23:03] <jage> iceroot: yeah that worked, thanks.
[23:04] <iceroot> jage: or just click the exe, wine will handle it
[23:04] <newfierich> dc0m: thanks for the help
[23:04] <dc0m> newfierich: try wicd.
[23:05] <dc0m> newfierich: maybe you'll have luck with that one. You are sure you have wireless card working in Ubuntu?
[23:05] <dc0m> newfierich: if you card is working ... and network manager does not show any connections, try wicd as an alternative.
[23:06] <newfierich> dc0m: I know the there are drivers installed for it...
[23:06] <newfierich> dc0m: I will give that a try and report back thanks
[23:06] <dc0m> newfierich: there are some nice tutorials on net for wicd on ubuntu, google it.

[23:11] <ardchoille> yes, Please don't tell people to "google it"
[23:11] <renegaid> what file system should be used for the boot partition?
[23:11] <duffydack> Ive had to reinstall my win7/ubuntu laptop, and for some reason I`m getting this (http://imagebin.org/84589)  and when trying to add a partition in the last unallocated space it tells me I cant add anymore primary, but ive made extended, which holds home/swap... this is the same partition setup I used last time and I never saw any unallocated spaces inbetween the partitions like that..
[23:11] <ardchoille> dabaR: I've been here for years ;)
[23:11] <dabaR> renegaid: ext4
[23:11] <SpaceGhostC2C> renegaid, depends on what your kernel has support for
[23:11] <SpaceGhostC2C> renegaid, I'd stick with ext2 or ext3
[23:12] <dc0m> dabaR: why ext4?
[23:12] <dabaR> ardchoille: that is not what it used to say a long time ago.
[23:12] <Gekko_____> disconnect
[23:12] <iceroot> SpaceGhostC2C: kernel supports everything
[23:12] <dabaR> dc0m: I think that is the default for ubuntu now.
[23:12] <dabaR> !fs
[23:12] <SpaceGhostC2C> iceroot, yeah. but as a rule of thumb, not all kernels support everything.
[23:12] <lokman> hi
[23:12] <iceroot> SpaceGhostC2C: all kernels support ext2-4 and some others
[23:12] <renegaid> so basically it doesn't matter?
[23:12] <dc0m> dabaR: i use ext3, sometimes ext2. So its pretty much up to you....
[23:12] <erUSUL> SpaceGhostC2C: the problem is with grub. it does not have a stage for everything :)
[23:12] <SpaceGhostC2C> dabaR, the reason I wouldn't use ext4 for my /boot is because it's not stable yet.
[23:13] <dc0m> SpaceGhostC2C: i agree.
[23:13] <Seveas> iceroot, ext4 only since rather recent though
[23:13] <dabaR> renegaid: well, you should probably use what ubuntu uses by default.
[23:13] <erUSUL> renegaid: use ext*
[23:13] <Seveas> SpaceGhostC2C, does grub2 support ext4 already?
[23:13] <dabaR> renegaid: but you could use something else if you want.
[23:13] <iceroot> Seveas: on all supported ubuntu-versions kernel support ext4
[23:13] <SpaceGhostC2C> renegaid, maybe. I use ext3 because it's stable.
[23:13] <EPAstor> Just anecdotal, but I'm running ext4 and grub2. Works fine for me.
[23:13] <iceroot> Seveas: 8.04 can handle ext4 also
[23:13] <renegaid> it doesn't say what is default
[23:13] <Seveas> iceroot, I'm fairly sure dapper (6.04, still supported) doesn't :)
[23:13] <dabaR> renegaid: what ubuntu are you gonna install?
[23:13] <erUSUL> Seveas: it should at leat the ubuntu patched version :) or we all would be in much trouble
[23:14] <Seveas> erUSUL, kk :)
[23:14] <EPAstor> ext4 is generally the default. Honestly, I don't think it makes much difference.
[23:14] <SpaceGhostC2C> iceroot, I don't just use ubuntu. I run my own lfs distro for personal use among other things. So it's not a bandaid solution. Best idea is to let him know the ubuntu specific kernel has support, but not all.
[23:14] <renegaid> 9.10
[23:14] <iceroot> Seveas: the server-edition, yes you are correct, its still supported (imo)
[23:14] <dabaR> renegaid: and why do you need to know what type to use?
[23:14] <dabaR> renegaid: I don't think the installer asks that.
[23:14] <dc0m> All linux distros are flexible enough to fit them to your needs. So using ext4 just because Ubuntu use it as default is not a good reason.
[23:14] <Seveas> iceroot, for anout 15.5 more months :)
[23:14] <SpaceGhostC2C> renegaid, if you want to live on the bleeding edge, try ext4 it's unstable but kinda cool and fast. If you want stable, go with ext3.
[23:14] <iceroot> SpaceGhostC2C: this is ubuntu-support, so ubuntu is default distri
[23:14] <seryl> dc0m: All is pretty encompassing, I'd say most.
[23:15] <iceroot> SpaceGhostC2C: let me correct this, ubuntu is the only distri here
[23:15] <administrador> que cosa es esta
[23:15] <SpaceGhostC2C> iceroot, Good job. Yes, this is ubuntu, but also I wouldn't pass on information that's only ubuntu specific as if it's true in all linux. I'd make sure to communicate that.
[23:15] <Seveas> SpaceGhostC2C, ext4 is definitely not unstable

[23:15] <dabaR> administrador: are you speaking italian?
[23:16] <SpaceGhostC2C> Seveas, umm, have they fixed some of the data loss bugs and other fails in the last two weeks?
[23:16] <Seveas> SpaceGhostC2C, so? That happens with any fs :)
[23:16] <blakkheim> lol no
[23:16] <erUSUL> SpaceGhostC2C: yes; 32 has no problems at all. and the important bugfixes where backported to 31
[23:17] <erUSUL> SpaceGhostC2C: also use jfs for a while and talk about a carppy fs ;P
[23:17] <SpaceGhostC2C> Seveas, my experience is that ext4 broke on me consistently for 17 reinstalls until I just went ext3. Plus my ext3 filesystems haven't broken ever.
[23:17] <dc0m> Seveas: ext4 is not recomended i production evironment.
[23:17] <dc0m> in*
[23:17] <Seveas> SpaceGhostC2C, lucky you :) ext3 cost me quite a bit of data (I was young and naive and didn't use backups :))
[23:18] <SpaceGhostC2C> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4
[23:18] <SpaceGhostC2C> Seveas, I've found that I'm a lucky person.
[23:18] <SpaceGhostC2C> I'll see if the newer ext4 isn't as fail as the previous.
[23:18]  * erUSUL lost some pr0n once too
[23:18] <administrador> do not

[23:18] <dabaR> hee hee
[23:18] <dabaR> administrador: what language?
[23:18] <Seveas> "On 15 January 2010, Google announced that it would upgrade its storage infrastructure from ext2 to ext4.[7]"
[23:18] <erUSUL> dabaR: is spanish
[23:18] <SpaceGhostC2C> But, I still say if you need some stability, then ext3 until ext4 has more time being stable under it's belt.
[23:18] <Seveas> not that one companys opinion says all, but they do carry some weight :)
[23:19] <dc0m> ext4 will certanly replace ext3, but it will be some time until that happens.

[23:19] <SpaceGhostC2C> Seveas, their decision bro. They can afford data loss.
[23:19] <Seveas> SpaceGhostC2C, that is true too
[23:19] <administrador> no hay nadie
[23:19] <dc0m> SpaceGhostC2C: that was my point, its up to them.
[23:19] <erUSUL> SpaceGhostC2C: no they can afford to hire ext2-3-4 developer Ted T'so ;)
[23:20] <dabaR> administrador: you might have to wait :-/ Or if you speak english, try here.
[23:20] <EPAstor> Honestly, once I had a major external hard drive fail, I decided to set up a real backup server. After that - I was a lot less worried about filesystem details. (rsync'd nightly, with dynamic snapshots taken and not overwritten for 30 days)
[23:20] <seryl> EPAstor: raid's nice too... imo.
[23:20] <seryl> EPAstor: drive failures shouldn't be something you should worry about
[23:20] <SpaceGhostC2C> erUSUL, anytime a cluster goes down in google they have more ready that are set up. The only real problem was in the last year the load balance was focusing to a specific group of clusters overloading them and leaving others idle.
[23:20] <administrador> my ingles es malo perdon
[23:20] <EPAstor> seryl: Sure... I didn't mention that the backup server is running a mirrored pair.
[23:21] <erUSUL> SpaceGhostC2C: Seveas they've got journal-less ext4 mode coded just for them (google used ext2 becouse of this)
[23:21] <Seveas> erUSUL, as I said: they arry some weight :)
[23:21] <jage> administrator: type /j #ubuntu-es
[23:21] <SpaceGhostC2C> erUSUL, why would I want to use it without the journal? Silly..
[23:21] <dabaR> jage: I think he said noone is there.
[23:21] <erUSUL> SpaceGhostC2C: well if google do it there is food for thought
[23:22] <dabaR> administrador: Maybe later someone will be in ubuntu-es
[23:22] <SpaceGhostC2C> We've all been offtopic for so long. Can we move it to #ubuntu-offtopic, but not drop the subject?
[23:22] <Seveas> SpaceGhostC2C, in a system where you can live with dataloss, it's fine. Google's BigTable is one of those systems.
[23:22] <erUSUL> dabaR: not true i'm op there.
[23:22] <dabaR> erUSUL: I thought he said that...
[23:22] <jage> no one is there vs. no one is answering
[23:22] <Yushatak> can someone tell me a graphical GTK-based FTP client that's in the repo i can grab to use?
[23:22] <dabaR> OK, well, all you need to do is get him there somehow :)
[23:22] <SpaceGhostC2C> Seveas, totally. I agree, hence why I said it earlier. But I doubt the original asker has that sort of system.
[23:22] <erUSUL> dabaR: he must have misstyped channel name. he did not enter the channel
[23:23] <Seveas> hehe, I don't even remember who the original asker was. The discussion was too good for those details ;)
[23:23] <ldlework> How can I force a Current Working Directory for an Application Menu item?
[23:23] <erUSUL> Seveas: a common missconception. journal does not prevent data loss it only prevents big fsck after unclean shutdwon
[23:23] <SpaceGhostC2C> I'm glad I was a part of it. Can we keep going, but in offtopic?
[23:24] <Seveas> erUSUL, replaying the journal avoids dataloss
[23:24] <Seveas> not prevents, but avoids :)
[23:24] <Nozy> hey all does some know the best way to over ride the "not enough free disk space" error on the upgrade ?

[23:24] <dabaR> Nozy: you sure it is an error?

[23:33] <ldlework> Its like... unless my problem is "Omg ubuntu just crashed my computer, its not booting anymore" I can't get the easy answers in here heh.
[23:33] <neil_d> ldlework: have you tried creating a small script to do a 'cd' etc. then using the application launcher to start the script.

[23:35] <mkanyicy> Bertram, what operating systems do you have? on which partitions? pastebin fdisk -l output

[23:35] <jp--> awesome.
[23:35] <cheezey1> this is so weird. i have graphics but i don't have the standard stuff like taskbars and stuff.
[23:35] <Bertram> ok, thanks, i will explain
[23:35] <Bertram> i had dual boot system, xp and ubuntu 9.10
[23:36] <mkanyicy> Bertram, how are you logged in now?
[23:36] <Bertram> different pc

[23:37] <Bertram> yes, version 9.10
[23:37] <Bertram> it does not boot from cd
[23:37] <Bertram> i tried to boot from xp cd as well
[23:38] <mkanyicy> Bertram, edit your boot sequence in your BIOS settings
[23:38] <Bertram> i formatted harddrive in other computer
[23:38] <Bertram> i cant, it does not allow me
[23:38] <mkanyicy> Bertram, which hard drive did you format?
[23:38] <Bertram> i have to press f12 at boot to boot from cd
[23:38] <Eremite> mkanyicy is right, Bertram.  You need to hit (probably) DEL or F12 when your PC is just startinmg and then adjust the BIOS to boot from CD first.
[23:38] <mkanyicy> Bertram, thats fine then
[23:39] <Bertram> the hdd that had ubuntu and xp installed
[23:39] <Eremite> Bertram, how did the error occure?  What made it happen?
[23:39] <mkanyicy> Bertram, and you formated in now?
[23:39] <Halabund> Hi!
[23:39] <Bertram> after format in other pc, i installed and still get error

[23:41] <Bertram> yes
[23:41] <mkanyicy> Bertram, what did you do after formatting?
[23:42] <Bertram> but still get the grub rescue prompt and does not want to boot from cd

[23:43] <Bertram> ok
[23:43] <tessarakt> then your problem is different from mine

[23:44] <tessarakt> umm, what are you trying?
[23:44] <tessarakt> booting from CD?
[23:44] <Bertram> i cant understand why pc wont boot from cd
[23:44] <mkanyicy> Bertram, as a rough suggestion, you should not format a drive if you still want to boot from it
[23:44] <tessarakt> you need to tell it in BIOS settings
[23:44] <tessarakt> the HDD is bootable after all
[23:45] <tessarakt> only the bootloader has nothing to boot
[23:45] <Bertram> i tried as i have read other forms and nothing helps

[23:56] <Dead_Link> when my ubuntu is suspending to standby-mode and then awakes on my command the device is starting but the display stays black/turned off
[23:57] <Michalxo> you should have grub2 if you haven't upgraded from earlier versions of ubuntu Bertram
[23:57] <Bertram> yes have grub2 but unable to boot from live cd
[23:58] <Dead_Link> i tried to install the intel drivers but it said that they were allready installed and xorg.conf cant be configurated because it isn't even there
[23:58] <Bertram> i checked bios but there are no options to boot from cd

[23:59] <Bertram> i even tried win 98 startup disk
[23:59] <Michalxo> Bertram try flashing bios :-/
[00:00] <Bertram> does not want to boot with any of these

[00:03] <lordbah> Lately it seems the system doesn't hear a lot of my left mouse clicks. It doesn't seem to be the hardware. At least if I hold the button down and drag it always registers that correctly. But single clicks often go unnoticed and double-clicking is nearly impossible. Anyone seen this before?
[00:03] <hipitihop> I'm using wireless keyboard & mouse via my laptop's built in BT, but if I do not use one of them for a few minutes, they time out, I have to repair by running 'sudo hidd --search'. How do I stop the time out
[00:05] <ax> should i just go with 8.10 and use backports?
[00:05] <sebsebseb> ax: no
[00:06] <ax> sebsebseb: so, what should i do?
[00:06] <sebsebseb> ax: 8.10 will run out of support when 10.04 comes out, or around that time  since 18 months of support
[00:06] <andrew__> Baah seriously
[00:06] <privateabstract> 8.10 is still a far greater version than more recent ones.
[00:06] <andrew__> Where the heck is the Evolution setting to only listen to subscribed folders
[00:06] <Flannel> andrew__: ATI, right?
[00:06] <sebsebseb> ax: 10.04 is next LTS which you can directly upgrade to when it's time, but it might not be so good in your case.
[00:07] <sebsebseb> privateabstract: I quite like 8.10 myself
[00:07] <andrew__> No?
[00:07] <Flannel> sebsebseb: No, you can't upgrade from 8.10 straight to 10.04
[00:07] <Flannel> andrew__: sorry
[00:07] <Flannel> ax: ATI, right?
[00:07] <ax> Flannel: yeah
[00:07] <ax> radeon
[00:07] <Sh3r1ff> Flannel: he has 8.04 for the moment
[00:07] <sebsebseb> Flannel:  yeah seems I didn't put in the bit about 8.04 to 10.04 works hrm
[00:07] <sebsebseb> ax: if you stay on 8.04 you can upgrade directly to 10.04 when it's time. what packages do you want later versions of?
[00:08] <ax> sebsebseb: svn, and a variety of audio applications, ardour, pd,..
[00:08] <q0_0p> anyone here know how to get rid of slackspace using dd?
[00:08] <hipitihop> sebsebseb, sorry to jump in, when you say directly, do you mean no need for intermediate upgrades ?
[00:08]  * jp-- is still unpacking and installing...
[00:08] <Sh3r1ff> hipitihop: nope
[00:09] <sebsebseb> ax: not sure about those, but there will be ppa's probably for quite a lot of that, and if not, you can  find a Deb maybe on the offical sites or compile from them.   only get software from trusted sources such as repo's, luanchpad ppa's, or offical websites
[00:09] <andrew__> None of the things will install anyway
[00:09] <andrew__> Apparently my internet is to blame.
[00:09] <Flannel> ax: Have you tried the newer versions with the open source -ati driver?
[00:09] <sebsebseb> hipitihop: yes no need to go through  8.10, 9.04, and 9.10   if have stayed on 8.04  and then upgrade to 10.04
[00:09] <hipitihop> Sh3r1ff, that's what I thought, I have been on ubuntu since 6.x and one could never skip an upgrade.
[00:09] <Flannel> ax: (what Radeon model?)
[00:10] <hipitihop> sebsebseb, ahh so this is a new feature.
[00:10] <Sh3r1ff> hipitihop: myself, i only go from lts to lts
[00:10] <sebsebseb> hipitihop: no not at all
[00:10] <sebsebseb> hipitihop: with LTS's always been able to directly upgrade to the next LTS
[00:11] <hipitihop> sebsebseb, I see my bad, you were talking about lts... ignore my noise
[00:11] <Flannel> hipitihop: Non-LTS versions are only supported upgrading from one to the next, without skipping, yes.

[00:14] <renegaid>  when I install ubuntu on my bios raid it installs grub legacy. anyone know why?
[00:15] <sebsebseb> renegaid: Which version of Ubuntu?
[00:15] <renegaid> 9.10
[00:16] <sebsebseb> renegaid: If your getting that  when doing a clean install I have no idea.  However Grub Legacy is actsually better really than Grub 2 and in quite a few ways.   Both are fine useualley.
[00:17] <renegaid> if I install it to a usb drive I get grub2. I guess it is not supported on raid
[00:17] <Flannel> ax: Have you tried the newer Ubuntus with that card?  From what I can tell, it's supported in the new FOSS drivers.
[00:17] <ardchoille> renegaid: grub2 is still a sort of "work in progress"and many people go back to grub legacy
[00:17] <q0_0p> anyone know if dd=/dev/zero if=mypartition is dangerous?
[00:18] <q0_0p> i want to remove slackspace
[00:18] <ax> Flannel: I had Karmic on here but i think i only tried the proprietary drivers
[00:18] <Flannel> q0_0p: "slack space"?
[00:18] <renegaid> does grub legacy support boot themes like grub2
[00:18] <suhail> hello, i need help with my ubuntu on ps3
[00:18] <sebsebseb> renegaid: boot themes?  you mean like with for example the Ubuntu logo maybe? a picture yeah?
[00:18] <renegaid>  a picture background
[00:19] <sebsebseb> renegaid: yes it does
[00:19] <renegaid> who runs ubuntu ona ps3? seems like a waste of tim
[00:19] <ardchoille> renegaid: that's what a gdm theme is for on grub legacy
[00:19] <Flannel> ax: Try xserver-xorg-video-ati
[00:20] <renegaid> is there something I can use to customize it? I tried startupmanager but it seems like it only works with grub2
[00:20] <suhail> regegaid... its not bad so far... i just need to get the sixaxis working as mouse
[00:20] <ax> Flannel: cool, once i finish backing up my homedir i'll give that a shot, thanks!
[00:20] <sebsebseb> renegaid: I don't have a PS3, but  it would probably be quite fun to run Ubuntu on one for technical people
[00:21] <Flannel> suhail: #ubuntu-ps3 is the place you'll want to ask
[00:21] <renegaid> no video support. might as well just run a live cd on a pc and it is really slow

[00:21] <sebsebseb> suhail: however what Flannel put

[00:22] <ardchoille> suhail: I found this, hope it helps: http://gizmodo.com/5143547/how+to-install-ubuntu-on-your-ps3-for-vintage-gaming-emulation
[00:22] <suhail> thanks guys.. let me try that
[00:22] <privateabstract> Why does everyone use apt-get? I find aptitude so much easier. It cleans up unecessary packages.
[00:22] <arand> suhail: You should be able to use either the ubuntu software centre or synaptic to install everything, if you don't fancy the terminal.
[00:22] <ardchoille> suhail: disregard my link, I misunderstood
[00:23] <arand> privateabstract: True, but it's all a matter of preference..
[00:23] <sebsebseb> suhail: Flash might not be availalbe on PS3,  and you should probably join the PS3 channel, if you haven't already
[00:24] <privateabstract> arand: Surely aptitude is more preferable though, due to the fact it does clean up all those unecessary packages?
[00:24] <ardchoille> privateabstract: apt-get autoremove or apt-get purge --auto-remove <- thos clean up as well
[00:24] <privateabstract> ardchoille: few extra characters than aptitude purge :p

[00:28] <cjae> Hi, How do I make ubuntu only use one kernel, so my booting to windows by default doesn't get messed up. sorry for posting more than once but changed my nick
[00:28] <Trek> cjae: you can remove the old kernel headers and stuff, i don't know the exact files you'd need to remove though
[00:29] <cjae> Trek: yes I know but I am not the primary user of this system, I put ubuntu on other ppls system so they will never know how to do that
[00:30] <Trek> cjae: in order to remove kernels you need to remove packages, if others are using Ubuntu, and you are the admin, you'll have to go remove the packages
[00:30] <Trek> cjae: or provide instructions ot others
[00:31] <dadoun> salut
[00:31] <cjae> Trek: I just thought the might be option to only use one kernel and upgrading it instead of getting multiples
[00:32] <cjae> upgrading = applying security patches
[00:33] <ambersean> hey guys, my neigbhors are installing 9.04, because we know it works, 9.10 didnt.  anyways, in the livecd i want to move their files over onto my usb hard drive.  but the livecd doesnt find my hard drive.  actually it sort of finds it but won't mount it.  maybe its a security thing?
[00:33] <ambersean> if i go into gparted, i can find my usb hard drive, but its not mounted.
[00:34] <ambersean> i think its a security thing?
[00:34] <jp--> Seveas is all installed sucessfully, I am now gonna reboot
[00:34] <jp--> :S

[00:35] <suhail> what command do i type on terminal to get yum

[00:39] <arand> cjae: Every now and again a new kernel version is released, at that point you'll have to remove the old one to keep it at 4 entries, i don't know if there are any automated ways to do that, I know I've seen old kernel being uninstalled automatically, but I don't know the procedure in that...

[01:17] <seanamber> guys, i was running with bad memory for a while, and i have reason to believe that my packages got a bit messed up.  isnt there a way to go through my packages and my disk to fix the errors?
[01:17] <JStoone> FHFHS, No problem, just trying to help as good as I can. How experienced are you in these kind of environments?
[01:18] <piero> Is there a apt-accelerator? Something that opens multiple connections to download the same file (reason: in my shared internet connection I need to open 3 or 4 connections to have good download rate due to competition with other computers)
=== Rune is now known as Rewn
[01:18] <JStoone> seanamber, have you tried to "sudo apt-get update"? and then use the Update-Manager?
[01:19] <blakkheim> piero: why use update manager when you can just aptitude full-upgrade?
[01:19] <blakkheim> JStoone: sorry that was for you
[01:19] <FHFHS> JStoone, hmm...not at all ))) but i'm learning ;)
[01:20] <seanamber> jstoone, yeah, it says everythings alright
[01:20] <piero> blakkheim, I think that is not an answer to me..
[01:20] <cant> How Do I get the volume button back on the taskbar??  Where is the Control Panel??
[01:20] <jp--> any ideas?
[01:20] <jp--> :(
[01:20] <piero> I'm asking about an accelerator
[01:20] <blakkheim> piero: see what i said right after it
[01:21] <piero> blakkheim, it's not easy to me. I need to translate what your words..
[01:21] <JStoone> blakkheim, dunno, sorry a little new myself trying to be helpfull *laugh*
[01:21] <seanamber> jstoone, yeah it does everything alright and says there are no updates, but when it updated the last time it gave an error
[01:21] <jp--> Imma try to boot the kernel with kexec using the UUID of the ext3 partition of the flash drive
[01:21] <seanamber> jstoone, i bet some of my old packages got messed up, i remember there being a way to go through and check everything?
[01:21] <ZykoticK9> piero, i've never heard of any sort of apt-accelerator before - just choosing a closer/faster mirror.  Best of luck man.
[01:22] <jp--> did not work.
[01:22] <jp--> omg.
[01:22] <jp--> :'(
[01:22] <JStoone> seanamber, is there some specific apps that does not work correctly? If there are witch?
[01:22] <cant> How Do I get the volume button back on the taskbar??  Where is the Control Panel??  So    nobody can help me???
[01:22] <JStoone> cant, I'm looking (:
[01:23] <blakkheim> !repeat | cant
[01:23] <ubottu> cant: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org while you wait.
[01:23] <ZykoticK9> cant, there isn't really a "control panel" anymore.  typically the volume just shows up - do you see a network icon?
[01:23] <cant> no,  no network either
[01:24] <cant> but obviously it too works
[01:24] <seanamber> jstoone, actually things seem to be working :-), i just got nervous when i saw that error on the last update
[01:24] <`mOOse`> anybody use identd - if so which do you use?
[01:24] <seanamber> jstoone, E: linux-image-2.6.31-19-generic: subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 2
[01:24] <cant> thanks JStoone.. I thought you forgot me
[01:25] <JStoone> seanamber, well errors are some bitches but they are only dangerous when they slap you the second time (;
[01:26] <JStoone> cant, no, no, no, not leaving you behind (:
[01:27] <v3rr3z> Hi
[01:27] <v3rr3z> I was wondering if you can move Ubuntu to another HDD without having to reinstall.
[01:28] <JStoone> cant, try hitting F11 and then hit it again, sometimes that works ? (:
[01:28] <tbrock> hey guys, i'bve got 2 hard drives, one brand new and blank, the other with stuff on it, they are the same exact type and size and I want to make a raid 1 out of them for a mirror
[01:29] <tbrock> is there a way to create a broken raid 1
[01:29] <cant> JStoone   didnt work
[01:29] <tbrock> move the files to the new drive
[01:29] <tbrock> then add the second disk to the raid
[01:29] <Alestan> Hey all, I got this error message trying to boot a system with super grub disk:  'error: Kernel doesn't contain suitable architecture'
[01:30] <Alestan> I think the image might have ubuntu 64bit installed instead of 32bit... Is that the case?
[01:30] <heretic9> is anyone here who has been able to pair cellphone with bluetooth on shell?
[01:30] <robb> so, ubuntu just can't do dual display with vesa and nv drivers
[01:31] <ZykoticK9> cant, try right clicking on an empty part of your panel - Add to Panel and select Notification Area and see if that brings it back
[01:32] <heretic9> there's million guides.. only got the issue on pairing the phone. just dropping me incorrect pin.
[01:32] <v3rr3z> Could you move Ubuntu By simply putting the files into another HDD Partition?
[01:32] <meowbuntu> hi
[01:32] <meowbuntu> hi

[01:33] <Guest101010> hi
[01:33] <meowbuntu> i am wondering if there is a later version of openoffice. i have 3.1 atm
[01:33] <ZykoticK9> v3rr3z, reinstalling is your best bet, BUT you could theoretically try using dd or a livecd like clonezilla to move an installed system to another computer - you might run into issues with hardware trying this mind you, best of luck.
[01:33] <meowbuntu> Trek, yes i'm frequent here thanks though
[01:34] <v3rr3z> Thanks
[01:34] <nfv> hola atodos
[01:34] <v3rr3z> How do you uninstall Ubuntu.. Just del the partition?
[01:34] <mengu> hi. how can i remove a resolution that's in the output of xrandr?
[01:34] <nfv> tengo un problema con mi disco duro me pueden colaborar?
[01:34] <^kub^> !es nfv
[01:34] <ZykoticK9> v3rr3z, you don't uninstall it as you suggested, just install whatever you want overtop
[01:34] <meowbuntu> v3rr3z, thats easy put cd in and install it
[01:34] <nfv> gracias
[01:35] <meowbuntu> v3rr3z, how new are you to ubuntu and linux
[01:35] <qwertyjustin> hey guys, xstart in the command line at startup doesnt work?
[01:35] <Alestan> v3rr3z a fresh install can be imaged onto something else with more luck than an already configured system.
[01:36] <qwertyjustin> any ideas
[01:36] <v3rr3z> I need to move HDDs is the issuse.. The one I have Ubuntu on .. Is getting alot of Bad Sector errors.
[01:36] <meowbuntu> v3rr3z, y do you want to uninstall ubuntu
[01:36] <nfv> lo que sucede es que estoy tratando de instalar otra distro en mi pc, iba a mirar las particiones que tiene, y cuando lo miro me dice que no tiene particiones
[01:36] <v3rr3z> Also.. Seems to be running slow.
[01:36] <ZykoticK9> qwertyjustin, the command is "startx"

[01:38] <mengu> hi. how can i remove a resolution that's in the output of xrandr?
[01:38] <mengu> i'd like to remove these:
[01:38] <mengu>    1280x1024_74.90   59.9
[01:38] <mengu>    1280x1024_59.90   59.9
[01:39] <happyface> This PCs ubuntu installation is slow. Is there an easy way to reset everything just like a format, or is it better to actually reformat?
[01:39] <JStoone> cant, AHA! are you still there?
[01:40] <jp--> thanks for the help anyway. I'm installing Ubuntu 9.04 now.
[01:41] <`mOOse`> happyface, there is a pgm that will return ubuntu back to a "fresh install" state
[01:41] <TheLastDodo> A quick question... does Karmic Koala still use the xorg.conf to tweak things such as supported resolutions and the like, or has that functionality been moved?
[01:42] <robb> has anyone gotten a second card working with vesa driver as asecondary display?
[01:42] <seanbrystone> moose you got a link for that pgm?
[01:42] <`mOOse`> I think it's called computer janitor - look in synaptic
[01:42] <seanbrystone> k
[01:42] <jrib> !fixres > TheLastDodo
[01:42] <ubottu> TheLastDodo, please see my private message
[01:43] <Amaranth> robb: you can't do that, only one card gets its vesa tables mapped
[01:43] <JStoone> TheLastDodo, Yes it is still here. Go to "/etc/X11/xorg.conf"
[01:43] <robb> Amaranth: first card is agp geforce2ti using nv driver
[01:43] <Amaranth> robb: but the primary card is also the one that gets mapped
[01:43] <robb> oho
[01:44] <robb> so no way to get vesa + some other card, working
[01:45] <robb> Amaranth: ?
[01:45] <Amaranth> robb: no, they both need to have a proper driver
[01:45] <robb> that would confirm what my google-fu is sensing
[01:45] <robb> ok
[01:45] <Lx3> I want to have two window managers how do I do that?
[01:46] <racecar56> i'm using KDE 4.3.2 with a fresh install of kubuntu 9.10, and pidgin refuses to go inside of the indicator applet
[01:46] <Amaranth> Lx3: that is not possible unless you have two separate screens setup in Xorg (setup in the way that makes it so you can't drag windows between them)
[01:46] <robb> Amaranth: no where on web could confirm this for me
[01:46] <robb> thanks for helping answer :)
[01:47] <Lx3> Amaranth i dont want them at the same time different window for different manager
[01:47] <methods2> what happened to all the pulse audio configuration tools ?
[01:47] <methods2> the gui appears to be custom now
[01:47] <Amaranth> Lx3: err, you can't have a different one for each window
[01:47] <Amaranth> Lx3: you can quit one and start another but they cannot be running at the same time
[01:48] <Lx3> thats what i want
[01:48] <JStoone> Hi, how do I get my Apache server "online" and not only local?
[01:48] <Lx3> my windows of choice are Gnome (default) moblin (secondary)
[01:48] <mengu> JStoone: you mean i can't remove the resolutions? but i have added them?
[01:48] <snoopy> my ubuntu got a virus
[01:48] <racecar56> snoopy: how'd you get a virus??
[01:49] <snoopy> it keeps telling me to update
[01:49] <Lx3> snoopy: how??
[01:49] <snoopy> and i dont want too
[01:49] <`mOOse`> lol
[01:49] <`mOOse`> dang viruses!
[01:49] <snoopy> }:
[01:49] <racecar56> snoopy: it's a setting that makes it do that
[01:49] <racecar56> snoopy: i wish the ubuntu developers wouldn't have made it like that, it reminds me of Windows
[01:49] <JStoone> mengu, Sorry? what is your problem?
[01:49] <Lx3> Amaranth: any ideas??
[01:50] <mengu> i want to remove a resolution that's in the output of xrandr.
[01:50] <mengu> i have added them but i added wrong
[01:50] <Amaranth> Lx3: for that you should have a session option at the login screen
[01:50] <mengu> one is working good, others don't.
[01:50] <Amaranth> Lx3: you can't change desktop environments without logging out though
[01:50] <JStoone> mengu, ohm.. let me take a loo
[01:51] <mengu> JStoone: i added them with gtf
[01:51] <JStoone> mengu, aha...
[01:52] <Lx3> i am totally ok with logging out, that is what i want, but how do I install the moblin eviorment so I can choose?
[01:52] <racecar56> Lx3: make a file in /usr/share/xsessions called moblin.desktop
=== WaterRatj is now known as WaterRatj[A]
[01:53] <racecar56> Lx3: then put the contents of some other file in /usr/share/xsessions into it
[01:53] <racecar56> Lx3: and modify them to work with it
[01:53] <snoopy> i tired install linux on a mexican computer
[01:53] <JStoone> mengu, sorry I cannot help..
[01:53] <snoopy> and it didnt work
[01:54] <snoopy> it installs and all but insted of going to the desktop it goes to a blackscreen
[01:54] <JStoone> mengu, are you running dual screen?
[01:54] <mengu> i don't know what is dual screen
=== JimmyJ|zz is now known as JimmyJ
[01:55] <JStoone> mengu, two monitors?
[01:55] <mengu> JStoone: nope.
[01:55] <mengu> one old 17" crt
[01:56] <JStoone> mengu, so does this fault cause any harm to your screen? Is it misplaced or ?
[01:57] <mengu> JStoone
[01:57] <JStoone> mengu, yes?
[01:57] <mengu> nope.

[01:57] <mengu> i have added the other two wrong.
[01:57] <mengu> i am currently using 1440 and i have no problem.
[01:57] <mengu> the problem is i cannot add another 1280 while these two are there
