[00:21] <Chousuke> melonipoika: that's dangerous
[00:22] <Chousuke> dapper may still break sometimes
[00:22] <Raskall> ahh.. it has a debian bug #, even
[00:22] <Hobbsee> !firefox1.5
[00:22] <ubotu> Hobbsee: Are you on ritalin?
[00:22] <melonipoika> ah, ok
[00:22] <soundray> Chousuke, I'm sure you can, but that'll open another can of worms.
[00:22] <Hobbsee> they took it out???
[00:22] <lucasvo> melonipoika: this package is from dapper
=== dragoon_ will be runing dapper in an hour
[00:22] <bina> how do you find out the numbers of all the processes your User is running?
[00:22] <Hobbsee> bina: top
=== lucasvo is already running dapper
[00:22] <Myrtti> ps axu|grep user
[00:22] <dragoon_> is it nice lucasvo ?
[00:22] <bina> Hobbsee: thanks
[00:22] <enyc> /joit
[00:23] <shadox> is there also a way to get mp3's working on ubuntu?
[00:23] <Hobbsee> !mp3
[00:23] <ubotu> well, mp3 is a non-free format. To enable mp3 capability, read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[00:23] <rikai> well.... if you guys plan on supporting gaim 2.0, you're going to want to update oRTP...
[00:23] <melonipoika> btw has someone upgrade to dapper from breezy using apt-get dist upgrade?
[00:23] <Raskall> shadox: search for mp3 on wiki.ubuntu.com
[00:23] <Raskall> shadox: or what ubotu said. :)
[00:23] <lucasvo> dragoon_: ye, but update isn't that easy
[00:23] <dragoon_> how so lucasvo ?
[00:24] <shadox> ok thnx i'll give it a tray
[00:24] <shadox> *try
[00:24] <lucasvo> melonipoika: it is not a good idea
[00:24] <Myrtti> since breezy has been stable for only two months, I'd stick with it until dapper became more mature
[00:25] <Myrtti> no, hoary
[00:25] <lucasvo> dragoon_: there are a lot of packages being held back
[00:25] <Myrtti> no, nevermind

[00:28] <kairu0> Madpilot, thats it. thanks!
[00:28] <melonipoika> so back with my first question, how can i modify the values of the frecquency steps?
[00:28] <shadox> uhu, i enabled all of it where it sais "uncomment the following ..."
[00:28] <soundray> izi_, I know it's a compromise because I'm not protecting my network against unauthorized use, but you'd have to do MAC address spoofing to do that, which I think is enough of a barrier.
[00:28] <Madpilot> kairu0: np - Baobab is a pretty cool app

[01:00] <rosen> Using synaptic to remove a program I dont use anymore. What is the difference between a removal and a complete removal ? .. I want to make sure I do not accidently erase anything that is used in other programs

[01:01] <limer> I just removed apache and installed apache2.  when I try to go to localhost via lynx or telnet, connection refused

[01:01] <platypus> please help me I'm new to linux and I don't know how I can setup a software !
[01:01] <limer> any ideas guys?
[01:01] <soundray> rosen, don't worry, it'll never remove anything that another package needs without warning you.
[01:02] <rosen> soundray, so it should be ok to use, since I found a better program ? (programs in question is gnomebaker vs. k3b)
[01:02] <soundray> rosen, absolutely.
[01:02] <rosen> soundray, ah nice :) .. I love buildt in seatbelts
[01:03] <shadox> any ohter sugestions to install the ff 1.5?
[01:03] <soundray> rosen, if you do a removal rather than complete removal, you can change your mind later and you'll still have your old configuration.

[02:34] <Ophiocus> hooo, requested, what a nice educated way to kick ban
[02:35] <Hoxzer> it?
[02:35] <mgedmin> nadira, the version of libc6-dev needs to match the version of libc6
[02:35] <topyli> nadira: try packages.ubuntu.com. but if apt cannot install it, i doubt it will be easier by hand either
=== hypn0 [n=t@62.41.131.245]  has left #ubuntu []
[02:35] <Ophiocus> i though ntfs what out of lins understanding yet?
[02:35] <mgedmin> since you have a strange version of libc6, I do not think you will be able to find a matching version of libc6-dev
[02:35] <Ophiocus> i mean samba for example cant write to it
[02:35] <mgedmin> therefore I suggested you upgrade your system to breezy
[02:35] <Seveas> Ophiocus, well, ntfsmount in dapper can write to ntfs
[02:35] <Ophiocus> safely?
[02:35] <tiglionabbit> Hoxzer: why do you need to edit it?  (uh, just create it then)
[02:35] <Ophiocus> no corruption of sectors?
[02:36] <jenda_very_busy> Ophiocus: experimental, AFAIK
[02:36] <Seveas> dunno, didn't test my windows partition after abusing it heavily with this :)
[02:36] <Ophiocus> thats what i mean
[02:36] <Hoxzer> tiglionabbit: Yeah, but I dunno what to put in then
[02:36] <void^> "safety" is a very relative concept =)
=== popeydotcom is now known as popey
[02:36] <tiglionabbit> Ophiocus: there is currently support for reading and resizing ntfs, but not writing to it

[02:37] <tiglionabbit> Ophiocus: well, there is support for writing, but it's unreliable
[02:38] <tiglionabbit> I guess resizing was easier
[02:38] <CaptainMorgan> in thunderbird... I see only one outgoing server.. but I have two accounts... how come there isn't a server for each account?
[02:38] <void^> writing to existing files, yes. creating new files, no.
=== andrei [n=andrei@86.55.139.190]  has joined #ubuntu
[02:38] <tiglionabbit> Ophiocus: it's probably because to write new files you would have to modify the journaling system, which is the complicated part
[02:38] <void^> and then there's captiventfs, which is basically cheating by using windows ntfs drivers.

[03:01] <jono> is there a way I can restore a specific file from a package? I need to restore the tveeprom kernel module from the 2.6.12-9 kernel
[03:01] <rosen> Can anyone remember the correct way to make the shell list all the processes sorted by CPU-Usage ?... or maybe there is another way to do it in Ubuntu ? (like using the GUI)
[03:02] <shadox> pasted :)
[03:02] <tiglionabbit> jono: what do you mean by restore?
[03:02] <Ed-Gein> QuestionMan : try poking around in here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation
[03:02] <tiglionabbit> jono: there's a reinstall option in apt, which leaves your configuration alone I believe
[03:03] <jono> tiglionabbit, well, I have inadvertently deleted the module, and I need to get it back - but I don't want to reinstall the entire kernel
[03:03] <tiglionabbit> oh...
[03:03] <tiglionabbit> hehe
[03:03] <jono> :)
