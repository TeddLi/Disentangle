<s> it 's literally two clicks after the usb boot started </s>
<s> i always installed like this and it worked , erase the complete ssd , make a 50gb partition in windows installer for windows . install there and leave the rest as unpartitioned space </s>
<s> then boot in the ubuntu usb stick , and proceed with the install normally where i get to the option of " install ubuntu alongside windows , remove windows and install ubuntu , something else " </s>
