<s> yea the gui is telling me " ca n't copy special file " </s>
<s> <user> : excellent :d </s>
<s> <user> : unless the copy is destined for a file-system that does n't store <unka*/> permissions ( such as ntfs or fat ), then permissions should be the same </s>
<s> okay cool </s>
<s> yea i am using ext4 . ty </s>
<s> <user> : " special files " are usually things like fifo pipes </s>
<s> so i should be fine correct ... it looked like a gnome thing anyway .. </s>
<s> i really only want to back up my <unka/> <unka/> keys </s>
<s> information is easy to back up ... but the rest , is in the home directory correct ? </s>
<s> <user> : this is a reason for working directly from a virtual terminal ( vt ) when doing these kind of operations , because the gui will be using several files within the home directory for live activity . </s>
<s> <unka-> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> <user> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> <user> : if you only want to preserve data you created , in <unka*> , copying everything except <unka'> ( files and directories beginning with a " ." that <unka'> them from directory listings by default ) is sufficient . if you want settings and configurations from the applications you use , you must ensure you get the <unka'> too </s>
<s> <user> , thank you that answers actually my next few questions ... thank you . </s>
<s> <user> : in a terminal you can see <unka'> by using the " -a " switch to " ls " . in gui there 's usually an option to enable listing of 'hidden' files which does the same thing </s>
<s> yea ctrl+h enables it ... i am getting the <unka.> files , but i am worried that some of the files in use would be like ssh keys ? if that is not the case then i am fine regardless ... </s>
<s> i am not using anything just copying stuff over , so i was assuming the stuff thats locked is mostly stuff for the current system </s>
<s> you're not copying them graphically ? :s </s>
<s> i am , i was told i could open up thunar , and just copy and paste into the <unka-> ? as one way of backing up ? </s>
<s> should i not be ? </s>
<s> <user> : no , files are generally only held open when being actively written to , or read into memory . the files that are likely to be cause issues are <unka-> control files for <unka-> communication - which you can ignore </s>
<s> flash drives ! = backup </s>
<s> <user> , ill do what ever you recommend , if i should not do it via the gui then fine , just what would be the command to copy my directory into the thumbdrive :( sorry ... guys , i know i am being very stupid atm but when i google , i find 1000 of methods of doing things , and i come here because i know you guys recommend the best lmao </s>
<s> tj- 'll sort you out :) i have to sleep now , i 'm punching out for the night ;) </s>
<s> but off google it just says make a ext4 , and copy and paste with the .files that are normally hidden </s>
<s> <user> : graphically will generally be a *lot* slower than a terminal shell , because the tools spend ages building internal lists of files ands trying to present a graphical representation too ... whereas the shell just gets on with the job </s>
<s> <user> : ^5 </s>
<s> <user> , makes plenty of sense , what would be the best command to copy them over ... a simple cp ? </s>
<s> <user> : also , when things go wrong , the gui often gets in the way of identifying *what* was the exact cause . </s>
<s> cp ( dir of home ) ( dir of backup )? </s>
<s> <user> : we have a tool for that ! " rsync " ... it is designed for efficient synchronisation of two directories , usually one is on a remote server , but can be used just as well locally . so you could do , for example : " rsync -av DIR/home/ DIR/$user/ DIR/media/ DIR/$user/ DIR/usb/ DIR/home/ DIR/$user/ " ( assuming " DIR/media/ DIR/$user/ DIR/home/ DIR/$user/ " exists ! ) </s>
<s> oh wow ! </s>
<s> well maybe at the moment if your saying i should be fine , i will just copy and paste and learn more about that for next time , all i really want is my ssh <unka/> keys , stuff like that .. should be easy to back up regardless .. </s>
<s> <user> : slight correction here , to avoid creating an additional directory in the destination : " rsync -av DIR/home/ DIR/$user/ DIR/media/ DIR/$user/ DIR/usb/ DIR/home/ DIR/$user/ " </s>
<s> wow thanks i need to look into rsync ! </s>
<s> never even knew this stuff exist </s>
<s> <user> : the keys are in " DIR/home/ DIR/$user/ DIR/.ssh/ " and " DIR/home/ DIR/$user/ DIR/.gnupg/ " i think </s>
<s> <user> , silly question gpg keys are stored in the home directory as well , as the ssh ones correct ? like i know for a fact .ssh should be what i need </s>

<s> <user> , would that not work ? </s>
<s> <user> : depends how the ext4 is mounted , but maybe " everyone " will have an answer for you </s>
<s> <user> : cp -p </s>
<s> cp changes permissions , mv does n't ( unless across volumes ) </s>
<s> <user> : they're slightly messed up , but the new permissions are more generous than the old ones , so most of the time it wo n't matter . a few programs e.g . ssh are fussy about directory permissions and may complain . you can fix them as you encounter them . or do the copy all over again with better software ... </s>
<s> <user> , well i really only want them for ssh and stuff like that , so how would i recopy it using cp - p ( home folder ) ( folder of backup ?) </s>
<s> i prefer " rsync -av " , not least because it has a " dry run " option .... </s>

<s> <user> : if you're very lucky , rsync will notice that only the permissions have changed , and it will fix them without a bunch of copying . </s>
