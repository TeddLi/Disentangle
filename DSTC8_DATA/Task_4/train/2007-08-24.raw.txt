[00:45] <hwilde> Stimulus_solutio, open up remote desktop on the windows machine through my computer, then use Terminal Server Client
[00:45] <cweagans> Stimulus_solutio:  tell them to install hamachi and join your network. then have them run the vnc server and you can connect.

[00:46] <hwilde> Lars_G, look into iptables.  that will allow you to lock down your machine against dos&brute force attacks.  don't be a jerk
[00:46] <Bucketface> I hav emade a 20GB space free for ubuntu, so what option do I select?

[00:47] <FFForever> how can i make ubuntu archive logs after 2 weeks to /var/logs/archived
[00:47] <cweagans> Stimulus_solutio: no....not router firewalls. They will still have to allow it on their machine (windows firewall, iptables, etc.)
[00:47] <Lars_G> like deny-hosts but wide ranged.
[00:47] <hwilde> Lars_G, iptables will let you block ports so they can't even attempt
[00:47] <Stimulus_solutio> excellent,. thanks a lot
[00:47] <bulmer> Lars_G then you do need to fiddle with iptables to suit your needs
[00:47] <serenityUK> jrib no it's from the terminal ,, but good thinking mate it has got me before...  he has got the hang of gdm stop it's the bit after
[00:47] <Lars_G> hwilde: ... and then how will I use the ports then?

[01:01] <Bucketface> sorry
[01:01] <bulmer> bruenig i didnt expect java to be dependent on specific ubuntu distro libraries

[01:02] <Bucketface> Pelo, I just put it there so you knew I was talking to you~!
[01:02] <bruenig> bulmer, java is in the ubuntu repos
[01:02] <dugurama> does nvidia have a tv tuner
[01:02] <Pelo> Bucketface,  you're not the only one , which is why I wonder

[01:25] <Pelo> Guest6589765,  then I don'T know ,  Ithink it might have to do with the windows partition not being the first partition on the hdd,   you better ask in #grub they might know better
