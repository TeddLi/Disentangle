[07:37] <llutz_> basil60: sudo iptables -L            has no block rules on them?
[07:37] <llutz_> basil60: portforwarding in your router is correct and directs to the right ip?
[07:39] <basil60> the IP address of the server internally seems to be correct
[07:40] <llutz_> basil60: "seems to be" is no answer. it is correct or it is not
[07:40] <basil60> I believe its correct
[07:40] <CrystalVoid> basil60: maybe the isp is blocking it ?  (my isp blocks 25)
[07:40] <llutz_> well, some people believe in flying spaghettimonster...
[07:41] <Cerrdor> basil60: whats going on?
[07:41] <basil60> I was able to access these ports ..at least 2 weeks ago.
[07:41] <CrystalVoid> a resent change maybe ?
[07:42] <basil60> the only "change" is an attempted Opensim installation...which fell over

[07:44] <basil60> Cerrdor -I have an ubuntu 11.04 server, which has been running with ports 7000, 7777, 8000, 8888 open...among a few others. It seems those ports no longer are available to the outside world. I've checked the IP of the server, checker my router for port forwarding, and checked my server firewall rules. Currenlty, only port 80 is working. The IP is 124.254.81.40......and I'm a linux noob.

[07:45] <tripppy> hi, any clues why i can rename a folder but not delete it?
[07:45] <Cerrdor> trippy user permissions?
[07:45] <Cerrdor> try ls -l
[07:45] <Cerrdor> see who the owner is
[07:46] <tripppy> im the owner. but ive noticed its all the folders on the one particular drive that are RO
[07:47] <auronandace> ki4ro: the cube won't work in unity
[07:47] <tripppy> ok ive run mount and i get this in return /dev/sdg2 on /media/TV type ext4 (rw)
[07:47] <Cerrdor> wierd
[07:48] <ki4ro> auronandace: Okay...how about in Gnome or ???
[07:48] <tripppy> thats the mounted hdd
[07:48] <Cerrdor> basil60: check your PMs
[07:48] <auronandace> ki4ro: gnome3 no, xfce yes
[07:49] <basil60> PMs - permissions? how?
[07:49] <zamba> how do i write a whole partition to an image file by using dd?
[07:50] <ki4ro> auronandace: Well, thanks.  More gray hairs for nothing! LOL
[07:50] <llutz_> zamba: sudo dd if=/dev/sdXY of=/foo.img bs=4k    replace sdXY
[07:51] <zamba> llutz_: will that also fill out the empty space?
[07:51] <Cerrdor> basil60: PM=Private messages
[07:51] <zamba> llutz_: like if the partition is 128 GB, will it create a 128 GB file? or will it actually just fill out what's used?
[07:51] <Cerrdor> means somewhere on your chat thingy there is a message from me
[07:51] <llutz_> zamba: it will copy blockwise, including empty blocks
[07:51] <Dr_Willis> zamba: will be  12gb

[08:10] <decci> want the squid to be able to tell me which users has been visiting which websites
[08:10] <Dr_Willis> there should be sites with find examples of that vsMS

=== mputtr|away is now known as mputtr
[08:13] <peetaur> vsMS, you can find that easily in the find man page. But I have a warning: many files that look older than 12-48 hours are not. For example if I download something in a tarball, and extract it, it might extract files with dates in 2009. Or if you copy something over samba from OSX, the client will set the timestamps to whatever they were on the client side rather than the creation time in the samba share.

[08:15] <FusionX> but is it possible?
[08:16] <kalacoa> hey
[08:17] <peetaur> atime? if I read the files, it changes the atime... so atime does not tell you the age of the file

[08:17] <rampr> hello, how to add ability to reload in an upstart script
[08:17] <peetaur> I know, and reading a file is accessing it, which means the file is suddenly no longer old when you read it, if you consider atime an accurate metric for age.
[08:18] <llutz_> peetaur: since there is no "creation time" saved on ext-fs you always have to decide what time you take (mtime/atime)

[08:23] <aelen_v> In live session: how to install nvidia-current without reboot - how to rmmod -r nouveau?
[08:23] <anonymous1> yeah always   im familiar w/that option.. unfortunately thats not the prob
[08:24] <Dr_Willis> aelen_v:  not sure you can. do it without a reboot.  you can blacklist nouveau where it  never loads via a kernel/grub option.
[08:24] <anonymous1> usually at boot the light for caps lock would go on after post screen and then id b at grub
[08:25] <anonymous1> keyboard works in bios and everywhere but grub

[08:26] <Dr_Willis> judgen:  i belive that used to be a common bug/issue. not seen  it  mentioned  in   ages
[08:27] <aelen_v> Dr_Willis: it used to be possible (dkms related, maybe before nouveau). But how to do it in Precise P. live session? Is there easier way than to prepare a custom live-usb or -CD?

[08:34] <lamaz> which do you think is better KDE or GNOME?
[08:34] <theadmin> !poll | lamaz
[08:34] <ubottu> lamaz: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[08:34] <fidel> !poll
[08:34] <fidel> ups
[08:34] <Dr_Willis> lamaz:  use both  and decide for yourself
[08:34] <fidel> i wonder if those 'better' questions will ever end ;)
[08:34] <theadmin> fidel: Nope, that's just how people are
[08:35] <Dr_Willis> is it better to try them yourself or ask in a channel ? ;)
[08:35] <lamaz> have to start with one or the other :P
[08:35] <fidel> buddha once mentioneD: experience yourself ;)
[08:35] <lamaz> hard to decide
[08:35] <Dr_Willis> you can  easially install both.
[08:36] <lamaz> i can, but i still need to start with one or the other :D
[08:36] <theadmin> lamaz: You can start with a plain CLI environment :P
[08:36] <Dr_Willis> sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop ubuntu-desktop lubuntu-desktop xubuntu-desktop
[08:36] <fidel> lamaz: im short: KDE offers tons of config options - while gnome seems a bit more minimal on the gui
[08:36] <theadmin> lamaz: KDE is closer to Windows in the user experience, GNOME is plain weirdness, same applies to the default (Unity)
[08:36] <lamaz> thanks :)
[08:37] <Dr_Willis> did i miss any  -desktops :)
[08:37] <fidel> Dr_Willis: edu ;)
[08:37] <theadmin> Dr_Willis: I suppose not, but installing those is actually a bad idea, you get multiple office suites/browsers/etc. I say install the base desktop packages
[08:37] <avelldiroll> lamaz: there is no "better", there is "choice" and that's always the best situation, as a beginner using ubuntu, it might be easier to find documentation related to gnome (as it is the default on ubuntu), but the best way is to test both.
[08:38] <llutz_> Dr_Willis: edubuntu
[08:38] <lamaz> avelldiroll, i was asking for opinions, people usually prefer something
[08:38] <Jacta> is it possible to get gnome3 to work under 12.04 in virtualbox? Tried two ways - a guide or in update center - but it doesnt look like gnome3 :/
[08:38] <Jacta> can I be missing something?
[08:38] <llutz_> lamaz: and this is the wrong channel to ask for opinions, sapere aude
[08:39] <lamaz> llutz_, yeah i noticed :)
[08:39] <Jacta> is looks like this now: http://screenshotuploader.com/s/01/K7IcUV7cM
[08:39] <theadmin> Jacta: You need to have Guest Additions installed
[08:39] <avelldiroll> lamaz: in that case you will find out that a lot of people use neither gnome or kde but another desktop
[08:39] <Jacta> theadmin ah- didnt think i have that now - ill try
[08:40] <Dr_Willis> or just a window manager

[08:51] <satyanash> theadmin, ahh Thank you.
[08:52] <satyanash> theadmin, using passwd without sudo did the trick
[08:52] <theadmin> satyanash: Cool

[08:52] <theadmin> satyanash: meh, bad idea
[08:52] <llutz_> satyanash: stupid idea, because it breaks sudo (as you've seen)
[08:52] <satyanash> Exactly!

I downloaded ext2explorer to see if my partition was sstill there but it cant find it. Is my partition gone or is it just corrupt?
[08:53] <satyanash> I told it to login automatically without a password.

[09:07] <Cerrdor> gribouille: sudo apt-cache search <package name>
[09:07] <Jacta> just tried the classic, looks 100% as the other :]
[09:07] <llutz_> gribouille: check packages.ubuntu.com   or use the !info packagename factoid here

[09:08] <pikaro> !info ultamatix
[09:08] <ubottu> Package ultamatix does not exist in precise
[09:08] <pikaro> hm ok, dead then ^^
[09:08] <avelldiroll> pikaro: if I remember well ultimatix was a successor of automatix, before ubuntu-tweak appeared ... and as far as i remember it was (like the other two) more of a problem than a solution
[09:09] <pikaro> exactly, avelldiroll
[09:09] <pooltable>  gb but i not sure if it is even working some gave to me about a year ago???
[09:09] <kai> hi folks
[09:09] <pooltable> hard dive
[09:09] <Dr_Willis> automatix - *shudder* *horrors*
[09:10] <cvr> Jacta: do you have 3d enabled in your VM?
[09:10] <pooltable> also i do not see my use hard drive ???
[09:10] <kai> I'm trying to get a backtrace from a crashing program, but installing the respective -dbg package didn't change anything, gdb still claims that it can't find debug symbols.. any idea how to fix this?
[09:10] <Jacta> was just out to check, cvr, it was not .. :) - Trying to enable and fire up again
[09:10] <pikaro> ok, i'll just mention it a quasi-dead. thanks for helping! bye
[09:12] <Dr_Willis> id say its a definatly dead.. ;)
[09:13] <avelldiroll> Dr_Willis: and in that specific case, death might a good thing
[09:13] <Dr_Willis> yep.
[09:14] <pooltable> how to add a hard drive ?
[09:14] <Dr_Willis> pooltable: plug it in.. power on...
[09:14] <anonymous1> :]
[09:14] <Dr_Willis> vague questions... get vague answers. ;)
[09:14] <pooltable>  gb ?
[09:15] <cvr> pooltable: tb
[09:15] <pooltable> i do not see it
[09:15] <avelldiroll> pooltable: and if needed create a partition tables and partions with gparted (or some other tool if you prefer)
[09:15] <pooltable> tb/
[09:15] <Dr_Willis> try mounting it by haand if its not auto mounting. Its possible its got some filesystem errors that need checked.
[09:15] <Dr_Willis> of course if its brand new.. it needs to  be partioned and formated..
=== Cerrdor is now known as init[dot]d
[09:16] <pooltable> dr willis how to mount it?
[09:16] <gr33n7007h> how can i play .mov files in linux or convert them somehow?
[09:16] <anonymous1> gparted > mount "your hdd"
[09:16] <anonymous1> or disk utility
[09:16] <avelldiroll> pooltable: the real question here is: is there already some data on the disk or not ? in short, give some context to your problem
[09:17] <Mandalord> pooltable did you format it?
[09:17] <Dr_Willis> !mount
[09:17] <ubottu> mount is used to attach devices to directories. See also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount

[09:17] <anonymous1> gr33n7007h i use a app called transarmageddon for quick converting
[09:18] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h:  vlc can play .mov files i  belive. i imagine most of the other video players can also
[09:18] <gr33n7007h> Dr_Willis, tried vlc and mplayer both wont play ;{
[09:18] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h: arista, winff, and other apps can reendode videos
[09:18] <Mandalord> pooltable: plug it in, power on and type sudo fdisk -l in terminal
[09:19] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h:  where did the file come from?
[09:19] <sacarlson> gr33n7007h: you might need to add some codecs with sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
[09:19] <gr33n7007h> anonymous1, is transarmageddon in repos
[09:19] <avelldiroll> pooltable: so get some information about it before trying anything ... plug it in and launch "fdisk -l" in a terminal
[09:19] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h:  try running vlc from terminal, play the .mov look for error messages
[09:19] <avelldiroll> arf too late
[09:19] <gr33n7007h> sacarlson, thanks
[09:19] <anonymous1> gr33n7007h it should be.. ubuntu 12.04

[09:21] <pooltable> ok
[09:21] <anonymous1> oops sorry :] sacarlson suggested restricted xtras already
[09:21] <gr33n7007h> downloading them now
[09:22] <Mandalord> pooltable sudo fdisk -l (the lower case of L)
[09:22] <pooltable> ok how  to read it?
[09:22] <gr33n7007h> still no luck with restricted extras
[09:22] <anonymous1> does dual bootin bt5 and ubuntu12.4 even make sense? lol
[09:23] <Mandalord> post on http://paste.ubuntu.com/ and give us the link
[09:23] <avelldiroll> pooltable: pastebin it and tell how your other harddrives are partitionned

[09:24] <gr33n7007h> same with vlc aswell
[09:24] <theadmin> Jacta: Use what?
[09:24] <gr33n7007h> can linux use quicktime player
[09:24] <Jacta> theadmin gnome3
[09:25] <theadmin> Jacta: No, I use Xfce
[09:25] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h: ive definatly played .mov in linux befor withoutneeding quicktime
[09:25] <theadmin> gr33n7007h: Unlikely, but I think other players can handle its formats
[09:25] <cvr> Jacta: one of my machines runs gnome shell, but it gets annoying pretty quickly
[09:25] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h:  is this some video/movie you bought? ir could have DRM.
[09:25] <Jacta> cvr what do you prefer then?
[09:25] <gr33n7007h> from my iphone
[09:26] <anonymous1> ah ha
[09:26] <Dr_Willis> a recording? or what exactly:

[09:27] <schnuffle> Jacta:  cinamon is really ice as it uses gnome3 but is usable like a normal desktopmy favorite
[09:27] <schnuffle> nice
[09:27] <gr33n7007h> Yeah will do
[09:28] <cvr> Jacta: its very customisable don't think your stuck with the default desktop you get when you boot if it doesnt suit
[09:28] <gr33n7007h> IMG_0095.MOV: ISO Media, Apple QuickTime movie
[09:28] <Jacta> schnuffle ill try that too
[09:28] <Jacta> cvr great! and I have an expert in you :P
[09:29] <gr33n7007h> can sox convert
[09:29] <schnuffle> Jacta: maybe one drawback itslinuxmint which is another distro based on ubuntu
[09:29] <pooltable> this is what i see http://paste.ubuntu.com/1050573/
[09:29] <Iszak> I'm trying to mount a device /dev/cdrom to /mnt/iso with options map=off and check=relaxed, is this the correct way to do it "mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/iso -o map=off,check=relaxed"
[09:29] <cvr> Cinamon is alright, I just found the shell isnt as stable as it could be
[09:30] <Jacta> tried the 'zorin thingie?
[09:30] <schnuffle> cvr: no problems up to now
[09:30] <Mandalord> pooltable, paste all the thing on terminal after using sudo fdisk -l
[09:30] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h:  sox is for sounds. winff is easy to use.
[09:30] <gr33n7007h> is that in repos
[09:30] <Jacta> http://www.noobslab.com/2012/06/zorin-os-6-is-released-based-on-ubuntu.html that one
[09:30] <schnuffle> gr33n7007h: ave you libquicktime2 installed?
[09:30] <pooltable> i did look irc://freenode/avelldiroll,isnick
[09:30] <Dr_Willis> yes.. time to learn the search feature..  ;)
[09:30] <Mandalord> pooltable: use Ctrl+Insert instead of Ctrl+C
[09:31] <gr33n7007h> schnuffle, 1 sec i'll check
[09:31] <pooltable> this is what i see http://paste.ubuntu.com/1050573/
[09:31] <gr33n7007h> no
[09:31] <sacarlson> gr33n7007h: might try some of these test video find out if your codecs are installed and working http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1425
[09:32] <schnuffle> gr33n7007h: install it and recheck if mplayer can play it
[09:32] <Dr_Willis> wonder if he needs the goodl old medibuntu w32codecs ;)
[09:32] <avelldiroll> pooltable: please pastebin the full output of fdisk -l, not only the part you think is relevant
[09:32] <Jacta> cvr - do I need the compiz something?
[09:32] <gr33n7007h> schnuffle, will do then try with mplayer
[09:32] <pooltable> ok
[09:32] <gr33n7007h> sacarlson,
[09:32] <gr33n7007h> thanks
[09:32] <cvr> Jacta: for gnome shell? no
[09:32] <Jacta> cvr for xfce :)
[09:33] <Mandalord> pooltable: i says paste all the thing, since i cannot get any useful information
[09:33] <pooltable> ok
[09:33] <Jacta> cvr "After you install/upgraded XFCE you might want to get Compiz/Emerald working on it"
[09:33] <schnuffle> gr33n7007h: and install the w32codecs as well
[09:34] <gr33n7007h> schnuffle, on it sir
[09:34] <cvr> Jacta: you'd like to have compiz? xfce has its own compositing window manager
[09:34] <Jacta> cvr: not really sure what it is and do :/

[09:35] <gr33n7007h> vlc definently plays avi's, right?
[09:35] <pooltable_> here http://paste.ubuntu.com/1050585/
[09:35] <schnuffle> gr33n7007h: avi is a conainer and can hold different codecs
[09:35] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h:  its all about the codec in the file.  not its extension
=== pooltable_ is now known as pooltable
[09:35] <bkerensa_> gr33n7007h: if you have the appropriate codecs
[09:36] <Dr_Willis> ive found very few things vlc cant play
[09:36] <Jacta> I dont need that, atlest not for now :D
[09:36] <schnuffle> Dr_Willis: +1
[09:36] <cvr> Jacta: I wouldn't really worry about it too much at this stage
[09:36] <gr33n7007h> lets try now then
[09:36] <avelldiroll> pooltable: so fdisk only sees your actuel disk ... or you sure you plugged a second one ?
[09:37] <Jacta> cvr just changed from windows(all my life) to at work to have 12.04 only
[09:37] <Dr_Willis> only 2 things i can think of that vlc couldent play. DRM protected  videos.. and those malware-virus-porn-auto-downloading-codec-things from a few years past.
[09:37] <pooltable> yes sata
[09:37] <cvr> Jacta: you can get the built in from settings->window manager tweaks->compositor and enable that
[09:37] <avelldiroll> pooltable: check /var/log/syslog for disk errors during the init
[09:37] <Mandalord> .pooltable: check that the device is plugged in and some sign of electricity
[09:38] <cvr> Jacta: your work uses 12.04?
[09:38] <avelldiroll> pooltable: it is time to consider that your disk might be unusable
[09:38] <Jacta> cvr my workspaces do, the other guy using a mac, but they cant afford it to me
[09:38] <vampirnata> is the only difference between xubuntu, kubuntu, and ubuntu that they use different desktop environments?
[09:38] <pooltable> avelldiroll should it be quite?
[09:39] <Dr_Willis> vampirnata:  basically yes
[09:39] <abys> I'm running on ubuntu 12.04 usb live and I try to access the casper-rw partition I've created but I can't mount it. If I mounted from a xubuntu live usb it works... what is wrong? Thx
[09:39] <vampirnata> Dr_Willis: basically? is there something else?
[09:39] <Dr_Willis> vampirnata:  dont forget lubuntu
[09:39] <cvr> Jacta: looks like you might have won out there :)
[09:39] <vampirnata> Dr_Willis: lubuntu?
[09:39] <Dr_Willis> vampirnata:  i think lubuntu uses a different default kernel.
[09:39] <pooltable> avelldiroll what was that soft ware g some thing for hadr
[09:39] <pooltable> hard drive
[09:39] <Dr_Willis> since its for low end  machines
[09:40] <schnuffle> vampirnata: LXDE as dektop env
[09:40] <vampirnata> ahh i see
[09:40] <Jacta> cvr mostly right now I'm suffering due old habbits
[09:40] <Dr_Willis> then theres edubuntu, with educational apps insgtalled by default
[09:40] <DieSel> Ieaao anai
[09:40] <sacarlson> abys: maybe you can't mount from a partition that's already mounted?
[09:40] <Jacta> cvr "use dafault panel" or "empty panel" at startup
[09:40] <vampirnata> there's a bit too many distros out at the moment :/
[09:40] <DieSel> Caanu onneea anou?
[09:40] <Dr_Willis> vampirnata:  not reall
[09:40] <Dr_Willis> really
[09:41] <angs> is it possible to have virus in ubuntu?
[09:41] <cvr> Jacta: default to start with, you can customise panels how u want and how many later
[09:41] <schnuffle> vampirnata:  i like to ave the choice
[09:41] <gr33n7007h> sorry it does play .mov just not that paticular one, weird why would tht be?
[09:41] <avelldiroll> vampirnata: nope, more choice is always the best option
[09:41] <Dr_Willis> angs:  not that ive ever seen in the real word.. theres always a posibillity
[09:41] <DJones> Caanu onneea anou?
[09:41] <h1ghte3h> :)
[09:41] <DJones> Ugh
[09:41] <pooltable> got it gparted
[09:41] <abys> sacarlson : what do you mean? is this partition mount in the background and you can't access it through the folders?
[09:41] <chu> angs: Possible? Yes. Plausible? Not likely.
[09:41] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h:  Drm protection perhaps
[09:42] <sacarlson> abys: it wouldn't boot if it didn't already mount
[09:42] <gr33n7007h> is that what you think it is, is their anyway round that possibly?
[09:42] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h:  fire up winff and see if it can convert it
[09:42] <sacarlson> abys: am I wrong I think you see it at root /
[09:43] <gr33n7007h> Dr_Willis, Will try now actually thanks man

[09:43] <Dr_Willis> gr33n7007h:  other  posibility - its using some newer codec/thing that your older system cant handle
[09:43] <gr33n7007h> possibly yeah
[09:43] <abys> sacarlson: I don't think so because when I try to install stuff on the system, I'm running out of space, even If I created a bigger casper partition
[09:44] <DieSel> ie ianea
[09:44] <DieSel> #ubuntu-ru Cannot join channel (+b) - you are banned  :(
[09:45] <abys> sacarlson: That's the reason why I want to use casper partition. But when I click on it i've got:  could not find /cow, please check the spelling and try again
[09:45] <gr33n7007h> Dr_Willis, thats the only video took when jailbroke do you think that as something to do with it!
[09:45] <sacarlson> abys: running out of mem space?  as I think it creates a ramdisk and puts casper stuf in that
[09:45] <gr33n7007h> gonna try convert anyways

[09:46] <tdhz77> My desktop is wired to the router, but when I try and stream big buck bunny 720p I get buffering every 10 seconds. Any ideas to why?

[09:46] <TheRedMood> I'm on my knees here
[09:46] <TheRedMood> I need help to boot into the powermac g4
[09:46] <abys> sacarlson: I think the system is locked in a separated partition with fat32 limitation

[09:48] <ActionParsnip> tdhz77: should be ok
[09:48] <TheRedMood> tried it
[09:48] <sacarlson> abys: well they make dvd install iso and they must be the same format and can be like 4gig
[09:48] <schnuffle> TheRedMood: press the c key while booting
[09:48] <TheRedMood> I've also googled it but it seemd
[09:48] <TheRedMood> Tried it
[09:48] <Dr_Willis> there is a #mac and #apple challen i belive
[09:48] <tdhz77> actionparsnip, If I'm getting lag. What could be some other factors? My ubuntu server is a pretty old computer.
[09:48] <ActionParsnip> TheRedMood: is this on a Mac system?
[09:48] <gr33n7007h> tdhz77, thats more than enough
[09:48] <abys> sacarlson: yes, but iso is not fat32
[09:48] <ActionParsnip> tdhz77: what are you sharing the folder with?
[09:49] <tdhz77> samba to xbmc
[09:49] <schnuffle> TheRedMood: tried what?

[09:49] <ActionParsnip> tdhz77: you can set different samba settings to improve throughput, I'd try it as stock first
[09:49] <tdhz77> My ubuntu desktop to my ubuntu laptop (wireless)
[09:49] <abys> sacarlson: nop. The casper partition is just an ext2 partition created in the usb stick
[09:50] <tdhz77> Could the router affect performance? It's a 2wire router. :(
[09:50] <szal> tdhz77: there you have it -> wireless, that's the bottleneck
[09:50] <abys> sacarlson : I've created it with gparted and is empty, so there is no system in it.
[09:50] <TheRedMood> yes
[09:50] <tdhz77> szal ok, thank you.
[09:50] <TheRedMood> But someone stupid
[09:51] <TheRedMood> tried to clone the filesystem

[09:53] <nibbler_> what happened to iputils-clockdiff in ubuntu? i can't find the package in 10.4 lts :/
[09:53] <Dr_Willis> tdhz77:  may be worth it to reencode the movie to somthing a little more suited for whatevggers playing it.
[09:53] <DJones> ActionParsnip: You were talking to TheRedMood who the bot kicked from the channel
[09:53] <MonkeyDust> ActionParsnip  theredmood has already left
[09:53] <TheProvider> im guess that wasnt for me either.
[09:53] <TheProvider> brb

[09:54] <dwakar> i can't use mouse wheel to scroll in ubuntu 12.04 , does uninstalling overlay scrollbars solve the problem?
[09:54] <nibbler_> thanks ActionParsnip
[09:54] <ActionParsnip> nibbler_: you can grab the deb there if you want, obviously get the right arch for your Ubuntu install
[09:55] <tdhz77> dr_willis is ffmpeg the best to transcode it? Is it possible to transcode on the fly?
[09:55] <ActionParsnip> !info iputils-clockdiff lucid
[09:55] <ubottu> Package iputils-clockdiff does not exist in lucid
[09:55] <Dr_Willis> tdhz77:  you could try the various upnp servers. like Plex, ushare,, or others.  I know plex can transcode on the fly. others may  be able to also
[09:56] <tdhz77> dr_willis you have so many answers. Where can I send you money?

[09:59] <aussie> hi all im having trouble with my compiz settings on ubuntu 12.04
[09:59] <aussie> help?
[09:59] <Womkes> but somehow this causes a segfault on this server
[09:59] <Dr_Willis> aussie:  details would help..
[09:59] <Womkes> only one giving me this problem
[10:00] <Womkes> I think something is broken, when I try to random make a file using nano
[10:00] <Womkes> like nano -w test
[10:00] <Womkes> it segfauls
[10:00] <Womkes> but touch test works
[10:00] <Womkes> and editting in vim also works
[10:00] <Womkes> very strang behaviour
[10:00] <schnuffle> Womkes: please one line or you'll get kicked by the bot

[10:01] <aussie> I typed that in
[10:01] <schnuffle> Womkes: whattype of virtualization?
[10:01] <aussie> when I was initially having trouble with the compiz settings
[10:01] <MonkeyDust> aussie  that's to reset to defaults
[10:01] <Womkes> All the servers are xen based
[10:01] <aussie> the forum did say use it at your own risk
[10:01] <dwakar> does  uninstalling overlay scrollbars solve the problem?
[10:01] <dwakar> does  uninstalling overlay scrollbars solve the problem?
[10:01] <aussie> well ever since then i havent been able to use my previous settings on compiz
[10:01] <dwakar> does  uninstalling overlay scrollbars solve the problem?
[10:02] <Womkes> I am running a script which rsyncs another script to a server, runs it, outputs an XML file which all the inventory data and that XML file is parsed by PHP which puts all the xen clients in a database with some meta information like mysql version, php version etc
[10:02] <aussie> btw how do I privately talk to one person?
[10:02] <MonkeyDust> aussie  try MyUnity, it's in the repos, you can easily install it
[10:02] <schnuffle> dwakar: stoprepeating yourself
[10:02] <ActionParsnip> aussie: you can use:   /msg name text
[10:02] <Dr_Willis> dwakar: try it and see if  it does?
[10:03] <Womkes> You know what, screw it, I think I'll just put this server on the skip list and let system administration deal with it :P I am a developer.
[10:03] <Womkes> But they are so slow, so I was hoping to fix this myself
[10:03] <dwakar> i can't use mouse wheel to scroll in firefox in 12.04 LTS, will uninstalling overlay scrollbars help?
[10:04] <dwakar> dr_willis ok
[10:04] <aussie> Hmm installed it, not sure what to do with it
[10:04] <sacarlson> Womkes: ya doesn't sound like your responsibility,  but might md5sum like nano or mysqld  and see if they are corupted

[10:10] <Dr_Willis> 'switch to classic' ?
[10:11] <Dr_Willis> !firewall
[10:11] <ubottu> Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo | GUI frontends such as Gufw (GNOME) and Guarddog (KDE from Lucid onwards) also exist.

[10:20] <ubottu> squid is a caching proxy for the Web.  See: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SquidGuard  See: http://www.squid-cache.org

[10:21] <Dave-Maydew> I have a Sony VGC-V2M which is a all-in-one media PC with the GeForce FX5700 in, and it runs smooth with 10.04LTS but I have issues with 12.04 with the 173 driver, has this been fixed?
[10:21] <ActionParsnip> Dave-Maydew: what is the issue?
[10:22] <Dave-Maydew> grey screen with a cut out where unity should be and not able to display anything
[10:22] <Dave-Maydew> does the latest driver fix this issue?
[10:23] <decci_> Anyone who have experience with squid
[10:23] <ActionParsnip> Dave-Maydew: tried Unity2D?

[10:28] <ActionParsnip> Dave-Maydew: could try it in live CD to test
[10:28] <Dave-Maydew> I did, but the grey screen
[10:28] <Dave-Maydew> the driver shipped with the live CD has issues
[10:29] <Dr_Willis> thats the nouveu driver
[10:29] <Dave-Maydew> is it??
[10:29] <Dr_Willis> nvidia driver must be installed seperatly
[10:30] <Dr_Willis> !nomodeset
[10:30] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[10:30] <Dave-Maydew> I know I'm not the only one that has this issue
[10:30] <sacarlson> decci_: seems to be docs for squid to do redirection http://www.shorewall.net/Shorewall_Squid_Usage.html
[10:30] <ActionParsnip> Dave-Maydew: try the boot option:  nouveau.blacklist=1
[10:31] <Dave-Maydew> OK I shall try it, I may even dual boot 12.04 and 10.04 till I've fixed it

[10:55] <balou_fr> @ejcweb - no kidding - have a look at photoRec, the link I gave you before - it s a simple tool that will recover any file still on the disk, even if erased or "loast
[10:55] <balou_fr> just beware not to use that disk anymore so your disk sectors don't get overwritten
[10:55] <ActionParsnip> ejcweb: oh jeez
[10:55] <ActionParsnip> ejcweb: I suggest you fsck the partition, may help
[10:56] <ejcweb> balou_fr: Will check that out.
[10:56] <ejcweb> ActionParsnip: What does fsck do exactly?
[10:56] <ActionParsnip> ejcweb: its like chkdsk in windows
[10:56] <balou_fr> fsck : filesystem check
[10:56] <balou_fr> might repair some of the filesystem but not recoer files
[10:58] <ejcweb> ActionParsnip: If the drive shows up as /media/HD-CUE2 then I can just fsck /media/HD-CUE2?

[11:04] <ejcweb> balou_fr: Can PhotoRec scan for files without restoring them first? I don't currently have a 500GB disk spare, but it would be good to check if it can find any files.
[11:04] <balou_fr> apt-get install testdisk
[11:05] <deepspeed> ActionParsnip, nvm, I found it.  Thanks.
[11:05] <balou_fr> mmh I don t recall exactly, I think it first scan the disk and then ask if you want to recover them
[11:05] <ejcweb> Also, is it safe to Ctrl-C out of fsck at the point where it is asking me what to do?
=== thomas_ is now known as Jambon-beurre
[11:06] <inertial> ejcweb: what is it asking you to do?
[11:06] <balou_fr> yes - no data will have been changed on the disk at that point
[11:07] <bilel> geirha: I don't really get what you mean by directory mode? in the doc they talk about mask? is it this?
[11:08] <geirha> bilel: changing umask will allow you to create files with write-permission for group by default, but it's the last part of that page I intended; what setgid on a directory means.
=== jacta_ is now known as CreazioN
[11:10] <geirha> bilel: umask may not be sufficient for your case though, you may want to enable acl on that filesystem and set a default acl on that dir
[11:11] <ActionParsnip> ejcweb: Fat32 isn't very robust. I suggest you chkdsk in Windows
[11:12] <ejcweb> ActionParsnip: With the hope that chkdsk might do what?
[11:12] <bilel> geirha: I'm currently looking at the setgid part, for the umask I will put 007, so when www-data user creates a file, I'll be able to write and edit, but it won't work if I create a file myself, so I need to take a look at acl for that? not setgid?
[11:12] <ActionParsnip> ejcweb: repair the file system. Sounds like it's not being used correctly (afe removal in the OS before pysical removal)
[11:12] <kodo_> anyone can help me with the installation of Java JDK 7.x?
[11:13] <ejcweb> ActionParsnip: Ok. I will reboot into windows and try chkdsk, and if that doesn't do the trick, give PhotoRec a try.
[11:13] <ActionParsnip> kodo_: do you mean for a browser plugin?
[11:13] <ejcweb> Thanks for your advice :)
[11:13] <schnuffle> kodo_: http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/04/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/
[11:13] <ActionParsnip> ejcweb: tell your buddy to get a backup in place
[11:13] <Mandalord> ejcweb chkdsk /r
[11:13] <geirha> bilel: If you set umask before creating the file it will give the file the "right" mode. The setgid will help with the group ownership.
[11:13] <kodo_> no i need it for set Eclipse to android programming
[11:14] <ActionParsnip> !java
[11:14] <ubottu> To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.

[11:14] <ActionParsnip> kodo_: schnuffle's guide looks decent :)
[11:14] <ejcweb> Mandalord: That's the command I should run, right? Does that go through all disks?
[11:14] <kodo_> thanks
=== pico is now known as Guest20449
[11:15] <schnuffle> kodo_: at least it uses alternatives to set it up correclty :)
[11:15] <balou_fr> personally I d still run photoRec first before u make any change on the disk, then run chkdsk to repsir the filesystem ...
[11:16] <balou_fr> if you repair first, then you alter the disk and reduce the chance to get more data
[11:16] <kodo_> ok let me try then ;-)
[11:17] <ejcweb> balou_fr: So photoRec doesn't modify the disk at all?
[11:17] <balou_fr> no
[11:17] <ejcweb> That sounds like a safe approach I guess.
[11:18] <balou_fr> it recover files, write them on another disk of your choice
[11:18] <bilel> geirha: great so it looks good for me, I will also enable the setgid and it should be ok,
=== Guest20449 is now known as JasonDC
[11:18] <balou_fr> if you check at its manual they even recommend to do a dd of the disk to another file so you have the exact bytes of your disk
[11:19] <balou_fr> but dd 500GB I don t really see that coming in the next 10 min :D
[11:19] <bilel> geirha: I've just found out 'chmod 2555' to enable the setgid , that's what you were telling me at the beginning with change the usermod, now I understand ;) thanks
[11:20] <geirha> bilel: you probably mean 2775 or 2770
[11:20] <CreazioN> I'm in Xfce right now, is there a way to keep all "window buttons" on the same line - as it is right now it only shows from current desktop window
[11:20] <CreazioN> does it make sense what I wrote? Otherwise tell me
[11:20] <balou_fr> you can try first on a small disk / usb key to have an idea of the results, you ll be amazed how much data you had removed you can still recover
[11:21] <bilel> geirha: yes I've just copy pasted, I'll use 2770
[11:21] <ActionParsnip> CreazioN: do you mean close, minimize, maximize etc?
[11:22] <ejcweb> balou_fr: dd would just do a byte-for-byte copy, right?
[11:22] <balou_fr> yup
[11:22] <ejcweb> But since photorec won't change the disk this isn't totally necessary?
[11:22] <vampirnata> ejcweb: do you have a windows machine handy?
[11:23] <ejcweb> vampirnata: Yes (dual-boot).
[11:23] <CreazioN> AceFace, ive made a panel with "window buttons" - when chaging desktop it only shows active desktops windows
[11:23] <vampirnata> I recently deleted a whole disk of music accidently and Recurva undeleted it all
[11:23] <vampirnata> it's free and for windows. (from the makers of ccleaner)
[11:23] <auronandace> CreazioN: check the preferences, you can set it to all workspaces
[11:23] <rodent> anyone good with UFW?? i'm trying to preconfigure UFW before I enable it, but it doesn't seem to take, I'm working remotely, I for sure have user.rules set with 22 open and other ports, but when I enable UFW, it blocks everything as if it was still default... anyone have any suggestions??
[11:23] <ejcweb> vampirnata: Ok. Maybe I'll give that a try later.
[11:24] <vampirnata> it allows you to redirect the undelete to another drive (actually recommends it)
[11:24] <CreazioN> auronandace, thanks - that was really embarrassing :)
[11:25] <auronandace> CreazioN: no worries, xfce is my favourite
[11:25] <Norwegian> Does linux have any decent rss readers?
[11:26] <CreazioN> auronandace, do you by any luck have a screenshot of your setup, I would really much like to see such
[11:26] <szal> Norwegian: akregator (from what I hear; don't use it myself)
[11:26] <avelldiroll> Norwegian: plenty, but that depends how you define "decent", i.e. you need to explain what features you seek
[11:26] <bilel> geirha: there is something I don't understand, when I create a new file it's www-data as owner group it's ok, but the others have read access, but the umask I have set is 007, shouldn't it be no permission at all for others?
[11:27] <auronandace> CreazioN: not at the mo, i'm on unity here (not as bad as i thought it would be)
[11:27] <ActionParsnip> Norwegian: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/list-of-rss-readers-available-in-ubuntu.html
[11:27] <Norwegian> Something like netnewswire or reeder on mac.
[11:27] <balou_fr> ejcweb: it s always a safety precaution (not mandatory though), especially if your disk is slowly dying and you are not sure how long it will last
[11:27] <ejcweb> balou_fr: Ok.
[11:28] <avelldiroll> Norwegian: i am using newsbeuter ... which suits my needs as i want an rss client in the command line ... but there is rssowl, liferea, akregator
[11:28] <ActionParsnip> Norwegian: I use feedindicator as it siin the tray :)
[11:28] <blackshirt> nothing wrong
[11:28] <ejcweb> I suspect I don't have enough 500GB drives free to manage this copy, plus another one to recover to.
[11:28] <balou_fr> probably overkill in this case, it was more of a general advice :)
[11:28] <geirha> bilel: umask only applies to the shell you run it in, and all child processes spawned from there. If you ran umask 007 in a terminal, then created a file with gedit that was not started from that same terminal, gedit will have the default umaks
[11:28] <geirha> bilel: That's why I said umask may not be sufficient for your case.
[11:29] <avelldiroll> Norwegian: i don't know this 'netnewswire', so you should explain why you find it better than others ... else you'll have to check for yourself
[11:29] <CreazioN> auronandace, why are you using that atm if xfce is your favourite?
[11:30] <nafcool> hey!
[11:30] <nafcool> I want to use the Unity Launcher API (on Precise)
[11:30] <rodent> anyone good with cli UFW?
[11:30] <auronandace> CreazioN: i like to keep my options open, its good to see new things to see if you can improve your setup
[11:30] <Norwegian> Right now I use reeder on my Mac. It has great design, readability, twitter support, google sync. Design is key to me.

[11:31] <Mandalord> rodent: how about gufw
[11:31] <ActionParsnip> kapz: what are you doing on the remote system?
[11:31] <CreazioN> auronandace, aah - smaaart :) - do you by any chance use pidgin+
[11:32] <MacroMan_> But the .tar file shouldn't exist yet as I haven't yet compressed the file
[11:32] <avelldiroll> Norwegian: so i am the wrong one to talk to ... i don't care about looks, only about functionality
[11:32] <bilel> geirha: hm ok, ok I don't think it's a big problem as long as others don't have write access, is the default umask 022?
[11:32] <kapz> ActionParsnip, running updates, configuring apps etc...
[11:32] <Norwegian> Design is how it works. Design is everything.
[11:32] <schnuffle> MacroMan_:  IF YOU USE THE Z FLAG YOU SHOULD CALL IT TGZ OR TAR:GZ
[11:32] <ActionParsnip> kapz: you can run updates via SSH, it'll be a tonne quicker
[11:32] <auronandace> CreazioN: i use pidgin, but hardly ever chat on it, mainly on as an email notifier
[11:32] <schnuffle> ooops sorry
[11:33] <MacroMan_> schnuffle: So .tar.gz ?
[11:33] <ActionParsnip> MacroMan_: or install unp, then you don't have to worry about what switches are needed
[11:33] <CreazioN> auronandace, do you by any chance know if its by default its possible to toggle the client - or makeable?
[11:33] <rodent> Mandalord: same thing.. yes....
[11:33] <MacroMan_> or .tar:gz ? <- I've not seen that type of file extension before
[11:33] <ActionParsnip> MacroMan_: just use unp for all archives and they will be extracted
[11:33] <rodent> Mandalord: that is what i'm using...
[11:33] <kapz> ActionParsnip, yeah OR I can use gnome-2d and do a lots of stuff but why is vino slow with gnome-shell?
[11:33] <auronandace> CreazioN: toggle what exactly?
[11:34] <MacroMan_> ActionParsnip: This is on a server (which isn't mine) so I can't install that here
[11:34] <ActionParsnip> kapz: maybe its a bug. Is one reported. I suggest you use ssh for updates
[11:34] <schnuffle> MacroMan_: yep tar czvf: c: create z:use gzip, v:verbose, f:filename
[11:34] <CreazioN> auronandace, toggle the visibility of the client
[11:34] <avelldiroll> Norwegian: in general sense yes ... in the way its use by apple as a marketing term, not so ... as i mostly consider macOS and macos apps in general to be utterly bloated, but that's my opinion, and that's probably offtopic
[11:34] <ActionParsnip> MacroMan_: if you have sudo acces sthen you can
[11:34] <schnuffle> MacroMan_: .tar.gz of course
[11:34] <rodent> Mandalord: http://pastebin.com/9vmH30zZ
[11:34] <ActionParsnip> MacroMan_: the 'file' command will tel you what it is
[11:35] <auronandace> CreazioN: whether someone is visable in your list if they are offline? that what you mean?
[11:35] <tty> running a virtual machine of ubuntu and the network interface sleeps after some period. is this normal?
[11:35] <MacroMan_> ActionParsnip: It's possible for me to, but I can't because it's not my server. ie I don't have permission from the owner  to
[11:35] <kapz> ok...also is there a way where I can remotely login/logout to the computer so I can configure lightdm while logging in?
[11:35] <glitsj16> nafcool: looks like you're missing libglib2.0-dev .. sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev

[11:36] <CreazioN> auronandace, if i click the [x] in pidgin its hidden - but it still runs - to get it visible again I go thru empathy and click pidgin - what I want is like ctrl+alt+a to toggle the appwindow to show
[11:36] <MacroMan_> ActionParsnip: -rw-r--r-- 1 my_username www-data    177464325 2012-06-20 12:25 base_backup_2012_06_20_01.sql

[11:48] <ActionParsnip> user-09: you can even script it to connect and run the command then disconnect :)
[11:48] <schnuffle> rodent: you enable the firewall which leads to no more packages accetped
[11:49] <avelldiroll> rodent: launch a VM and test your configuration on a similar system before trying to set up one remotly
[11:49] <Norwegian> avelldiroll: You're thinking about the pc world. Apple is a lot bigger with iPhone and iPad. Your definition of mac users is also outdated.
[11:50] <avelldiroll> Norwegian: no, i am comparing things that are comparable ... and i was speaking about MacOS, i thought my precedent sentences were clear about that
[11:51] <llutz> rodent: why don't you just define an iptables-ruleset and load that when starting up? and if you fiddle with "firewall" from remote, always make sure to have a cron-job running, resetting the rules after xx minutes

[11:57] <rodent> schnuffle: i enable the firwall with allt he rules already pre-defined in user.rules, and i also && re-allow ssh, but i still lose all connectivity to my box...
[11:57] <ActionParsnip> mint_: what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
[11:57] <llutz> rodent: well and just because those misbehaviours i'd prefer plain iptables-rules instead of any obscure code to handle those
[12:00] <schnuffle> rodent: sure that the second command gets executed when the firewall is up and already blocking you. Write a bash script  with your commands and execute it in a screen to see if it makes a difference. Maybe add a iptables -L > ufw.log to see what happened
[12:00] <reza_99999> how to convert laptop wireless to a Hot-Spot?
[12:00] <rodent> schnuffle: it does, as it says " rule exists skipping.. "

[12:33] <Defusal> the issue itself is messed up though
[12:33] <MonkeyDust> kesroesweyth  make sure you don't have too many kernels installed in /
[12:33] <Defusal> i don't understand how the latest package can have a major python issue for about a year and there is still no info online about it
[12:34] <manananana> usr13 thats what i am asking :D i will try to copy my home folder via guest
[12:34] <kesroesweyth> MonkeyDust how do I check?
[12:34] <MonkeyDust> Defusal  maybe nobody noticed
[12:34] <usr13> manananana: What happens when you try to login original user?
[12:35] <MonkeyDust> kesroesweyth  you could use ubuntu-tweak
[12:35] <manananana> usr13 not much black screen and back to the log in screen
[12:35] <usr13> manananana: black login screen?
[12:35] <kesroesweyth> MonkeyDust sounds gimmicky lol i'd like to learn to troubleshoot this type of thing using common linux tools if possible
[12:36] <sulaiman> Hi
[12:36] <manananana> usr13 no i type my password and then black screen after few sec i got back to the log in screen
[12:36] <sulaiman> Is it possible to have two zip packages with the same md5 checksum, but with different file contents?
[12:36] <usr13> manananana: Sounds like wrong password.

[12:37] <manananana> usr13 nope when you type wrong password you have wrong password error
[12:37] <Defusal> MonkeyDust, since the only other reliable way to restrict processes to certain cpus using a kernel parameter is completely ignored by ubuntu server, i'd think someone would have noticed...
[12:37] <manananana> usr13 its loging in but after 1 sec its loging out
[12:37] <usr13> manananana: Well, I'm at a loss trying to figure out why it will login another user and not the original user.

[13:30] <Wiz_KeeD> hey guys, in ubuntu 10.04 Lucid, does anyone know why the wireless connection doesn't work anymore an tried to connect and always keeps asking for the password, but on the windwos os or from android phone wireless works perfectly
[13:30] <Wiz_KeeD> furthermore if i boot ubuntu and leave it untouched it automatically connects to the wireless network, and then in a matter of minutes it freezes completly
[13:31] <Wiz_KeeD> and if i disconnect and try to connect the behaviour from above keeps hapening and doesn't connect
[13:31] <Wiz_KeeD> any ideeas why?
[13:31] <Mandalord> Jacta: i think you should install glibc, gtk
[13:31] <MonkeyDust> Wiz_KeeD  password or wpa key ?
[13:31] <Wiz_KeeD> MonkeyDust, works perfectly from windows, android phone
[13:32] <Wiz_KeeD> and if i leave it untouched from boot it connects to it
[13:32] <ikonia> Mandalord: glibc is already installed, or the system word not run
[13:32] <ikonia> would
[13:32] <MonkeyDust> Wiz_KeeD  password or wpa key ?
[13:32] <Wiz_KeeD> i'm not at home right now but i'm not sure which one
[13:32] <Wiz_KeeD> why?
[13:32] <Mandalord> uhm since it installed with gcc

[13:34] <MonkeyDust> Wiz_KeeD  to be able to give advice, we need to know what's wrong
[13:34] <Wiz_KeeD> let me try to find out
[13:34] <ikonia> Jacta: what are you actually trying to do ?
[13:34] <Alexander_> How to know what's wrong with RAID?
[13:34] <ikonia> Alexander_: use the raid tools to diagnose the problem
[13:35] <ikonia> Alexander_: analyise the error
[13:35] <Jacta> ikonia i want to add a plugin into pidgin
[13:35] <ElLocoGato> SkippersBoss, originally (right after boot) everything is OK.  Input is in PAVU.  Can record with Audacity.  After some time, the input is no longer in PAVU (or alsamixer).  Unplug/plug USB cable shows device info in dmesg, but the input is not restored.  Occasionally I will see the input flash momentarily in PAVU on replug.

[13:37] <SkippersBoss> ElLocoGato: I am not an expert Just some one who's been working with Ubuntu since 2007. I have had some previous issues with a microphone setup as well and this turned out to be caused by PA. Disabling PA solved the issue for me

[13:38] <MonkeyDust> Wiz_KeeD  make sure the wpa key is saved in the connection settings
[13:38] <Jacta> ikonia installed it now - error is 100% the same
[13:38] <Mandalord> ikonia: Readme says The libraries and includes for the following libraries/products are required: Pidgin [includes libpurple], GLIB, GTK, Cairo, Pango, ATK
[13:38] <ikonia> Jacta: you're misssing a header from a dependency
[13:38] <ElLocoGato> SkippersBoss, yeah, PA has never been completely stable for me.  But this mic has been fine since 10.04 using PA.
[13:38] <ikonia> ok, so it's probably tthe gtk/pango/atk development packages that are missing
[13:38] <Jacta> Mandalord but the names it not like that to find - and some of them have more :/
[13:39] <Wiz_KeeD> it is saved under wireless security
[13:39] <SkippersBoss> EllocoGato: However with 12.04 Pulse works fine. Disable pulse by entering autospawn=0 in ~/.pulse/client.conf
[13:39] <Jacta> ikonia guess thats the problem - dunno really what to install to catch thoose libs and prod..

[13:51] <myhero> ActionParsnip: my motive was to mount the iso so system sees it as a cd or dvd n not just mount and open the iso...
[13:51] <Jacta> Mandalord allready there :/
[13:51] <ActionParsnip> myhero: the 2 are the same in ubuntu, what is your aim?
[13:51] <ndlovu> I get this message "samba : Depends: samba-common (= 2:3.6.3-2ubuntu2.2) but 2:3.6.3-2ubuntu2.3 is installed", but the version listed on packages.ubuntu.com is 2:3.6.3-2ubuntu2.1. What's the significance of the 2.1,2.2 and 2.3? I seem to have a version installed which is too recent.
[13:51] <Mandalord> and libpango1.0-0
[13:52] <ikonia> ndlovu: do you have a PPA installed.
[13:52] <ikonia> (configured)
[13:52] <indieross> i keep getting flash objects bleeding through other apps any ideas how to fix this
[13:52] <schnuffle> ndlovu: use pastebinit to paste your sources.list
[13:52] <helphelphelp> well im logged as root, for sure. Threw the user comand, I add one, "wam" as i dont want to fuck my unix sys because i still running root, even if i put a protection of the root thanks the the bash config
[13:52] <ikonia> schnuffle: that won't help if the sources are in sources.list.d
[13:52] <ElLocoGato> SkippersBoss, disable PA and logout/login restored the mic.  We'll see if it lasts...
[13:52] <Jacta> Mandalord also there
[13:52] <ndlovu> ikonia, I had a partner ppa but I've disabled that now
[13:52] <schnuffle> ikonia: true but I have to start somewhere :)
[13:53] <ndlovu> but it could have installed from there during the upgrade
[13:53] <ikonia> ndlovu: you'll find that's probably caused the conflict
[13:53] <SkippersBoss> ellocogato: Always glad to help :-)
[13:53] <myhero> ActionParsnip: i was using aptoncd....and it creates iso...but when mounting the same iso....system mounts it as a virtual iso n not cd/dvd and aptoncd does'nt recognizes it and keeps on asking to insert cd/dvd.....
[13:53] <ndlovu> ikonia, can I remove samba and reinstall?
[13:53] <Mandalord> and libatk1.0-0
[13:53] <ActionParsnip> myhero: hmm, is there a tweak in config to use a folder?
[13:53] <ActionParsnip> !aptoncd
[13:53] <ubottu> APTonCD is a tool with a graphical interface which allows you to create one or more CDs or DVDs with all of the packages you've downloaded via apt-get or aptitude, creating a removable repository that you can use on other computers - See also !offline
[13:53] <Mandalord> :-/
[13:53] <ikonia> ndlovu: I don't think it will make a difference, but it's possible it could work (I'd have to follow the dependency tree through properly for you to confirm)
=== anant is now known as anant_
[13:54] <myhero> ActionParsnip: what tweak ?
[13:54] <MonkeyDust> myhero  you need aptoncd again to recover the packages in the iso
[13:54] <ActionParsnip> myhero: in aptoncd
[13:54] <zykotick9> ikonia: without removing the source that provided the updated samba, remove and reinstall seems pointless... (just comment from peanut gallery)
[13:54] <Jacta> Mandalord can't you try?
[13:54] <ActionParsnip> MonkeyDust: do you need tro mount the iso for aptoncd to use it?
[13:54] <myhero> ActionParsnip: yea....
[13:55] <ikonia> zykotick9: I agree, which is why I Said it won't work
[13:55] <schnuffle> ndlovu: you can do following: install apt-show-versions, run  apt-show-versions | grep 'No available' then you have the packages that have no repo candidate and you can delete them or replace them
[13:55] <MonkeyDust> ActionParsnip  myhero no, it's just a regular file, like .tar or zo
[13:55] <myhero> ActionParsnip: but i have saved aptoncd deb files from apt cache and install from there
[13:55] <Ormie> ikonia, pm.
[13:55] <ndlovu> zykotick9, ActionParsnip, I've disabled all PPA sources now
[13:55] <zykotick9> ndlovu: did you use ppa-purge?
[13:55] <ActionParsnip> MonkeyDust myhero : yes but does aptoncd actually need a burned CD, or can it use an ISO file...
[13:55] <ikonia> Ormie: no thanks
[13:56] <ndlovu> I would have expected the Update Manager to do that automatically before I started the upgrade, but that's another issue
[13:56] <zykotick9> ndlovu: just removing the ppa sources, is going to leave you system in an inconsistent state
[13:56] <maciejjo> hi
[13:56] <kms11> hi, yesterday i use it "apt-get update" in my ubuntu and now my file manager does not open,i dont know what happen?
[13:56] <MonkeyDust> ActionParsnip  myhero not sure and cannot test now, rsync is running
[13:56] <maciejjo> I've got a problem with printing pdf file
[13:56] <Mandalord> well it seem that we have to point out the location of all the libs in file config.linux
[13:56] <Jacta> schnuffle do you got other clues :/?
[13:56] <ndlovu> zykotick9, I commented out all sources in each file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
[13:56] <Joshun> kms11 - what happens if you run it from terminal
[13:56] <myhero> MonkeyDust: thats only i m saying.....it needs burned cd dvd so i was asking any app to spoof system for iso as virtual cd dvd
[13:56] <maciejjo> the file has 4 pages, but the printer prints 4 blank pages
[13:57] <schnuffle> Jacta: what do you want to compile?
[13:57] <myhero> !rsync
[13:57] <zykotick9> ndlovu: well good luck (i'm adding you to /ignore so i won't see your issue further)
[13:57] <ubottu> rsync is a fast remote file copy and synchronization program - For more see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync
[13:57] <kms11> Joshun, i see my directories at terminal, but in grapjical mode no.
[13:57] <maciejjo> It was generated by posterazor
[13:57] <ndlovu> thanks zykotick9
[13:57] <indieross> my flash problem looks like this http://i.imgur.com/gh3k4.jpg
[13:57] <Jacta> schnuffle a pidgin plugin, can only find it as source and a dll :/
[13:57] <maciejjo> and when i print to file, it also generates 4 blank pages
[13:57] <maciejjo> other pdf is working fine
[13:57] <schnuffle> Jacta: which plugin?
[13:57] <ActionParsnip> myhero: if you go into the packages folder in the ISO there is all the deb files and you can install from there
[13:57] <Dshoe> anyone know the best way to sync music with mtp? such as my galaxy nesu?
[13:58] <Dshoe> nexus*
[13:58] <Joshun> does it launch properly though - what happens if you run nautilus (or whatever you use) from terminal [kms11]
[13:58] <Jacta> schnuffle http://www.castledragmire.com/Projects/Status_Hot_Keys
[13:58] <Dshoe> rhythmbox and banshee both fail to sync properly
[13:59] <myhero> ActionParsnip: yea that i can but the problem is that it contains all the debs of all apps installed on system which i dont want......in aptoncd i can which apps ddebs i wanna install n i can install that app only with its dependencies which also cannot be seen in iso folder
[13:59] <Joshun> is there anyway of setting chromium/google chrome to use its own password store, system-wide?
[14:00] <kms11> Joshun, when i run nautilus, it say this:
[14:00] <kms11> Gtk-ERROR **: GTK+ 2.x symbols detected. Using GTK+ 2.x and GTK+ 3 in the same process is not supported
[14:00] <kms11> Trace/breakpoint trap
[14:00] <schnuffle> Jacta: okay end the error kine from make?

[14:00] <Iluvalar> Hello, the warzone2100 game need the port 2100 open to run in multiplayer. It seem like that port was shut while I upgraded to 12.04 . Someone could help please ?
[14:00] <ActionParsnip> myhero: i guess, if there isn't an option to use the ISO file, or it can't be made to use a folder of the mounted ISo then I'm not sure
[14:00] <Jacta> schnuffle it came from "make lib" yes
[14:00] <Joshun> kms11 - try reinstalling nautilus - sudo apt-get --reinstall install nautilus
[14:00] <myhero> ActionParsnip: so any 3rd party app for mounting iso as virtual cd dvd
[14:00] <kms11> Joshun, ok,

[14:01] <ActionParsnip> myhero: https://answers.launchpad.net/aptoncd/+question/97721
[14:02] <Joshun> kms11 - you could also try resetting your user config - rm -rf ~/.gconf  ~/.gnome2
[14:02] <DMTamey> hello does anyone know in how i can fix ubuntu load that has failed with wubii i updated the software and now it wont load.
[14:02] <Joshun> beware though you may lose settings
[14:02] <ActionParsnip> Joshun: why force?
[14:02] <Joshun> force
[14:02] <Joshun> what
[14:02] <Joshun> you cannot remove directories with rm without using -rf
[14:02] <schnuffle> Jacta: can you paste it?
[14:03] <ActionParsnip> Joshun: you only need -r to delete direcorys
[14:03] <Jacta> the error again, schnuffle?
[14:03] <schnuffle> yes
[14:03] <Joshun> well if there are any permissions problems it may work around them

[14:04] <blogorge> Hi!  I was using ubuntu as root and had some files on my desktop, then when I upgraded to 12.04 I can no longer log in as root so, how can I recover the files I had on my root desktop?
[14:04] <Mandalord> Jacta: open file config.linux and you will see why they cause error
[14:04] <schnuffle> Jacta: libnotify-dev installed?
[14:04] <Joshun> not for user-space config. for system wide then yes it would be
[14:04] <ndlovu> ikonia, if I run "dpkg --configure -a" then it's now only samba that comes up with dependency problems: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1050936/. Can this be resolved? Or am I better off just doing a reinstall?
[14:05] <Jacta> it was not, schnuffle - but didnt help
[14:05] <Jacta> Mandalord, yes, im there now?
[14:05] <ikonia> ndlovu: you could try removing samba, but again, I can't confirm unless I walk the dependency tree
[14:05] <Mandalord> Jacta: look at USER CONFIGURATION
[14:06] <Mandalord> they are the path of the libraries
[14:06] <ndlovu> ikonia, sudo apt-get remove samba ?
[14:06] <schnuffle> Jacta: but it should provide notify.h
[14:06] <Mandalord> but they are NOT correct
[14:06] <ikonia> ndlovu: yes
[14:06] <Iluvalar> I'll try a router reboot... but if it fail, you gonna hear about me again >:P
[14:06] <blogorge> Hi!  how can I recover the files I had on my root desktop before upgrading to 12.04?
[14:06] <myhero> ActionParsnip: so i only need to add that iso source to the source list......????? n what do i give when i give that source....deb or iso file:///....../......iso
[14:06] <Jacta> this is really complicated schnuffle / Mandalord
[14:06] <schnuffle> blogorge: under ~/Desktop maybe
[14:07] <ndlovu> ikonia, then apt-get update; apt-get install samba ?
[14:07] <Joshun> kms11 - is it ok now? if you reset your config, you will have to change your wallpaper etc. back again. don't worry though - it won't touch the actual images files.
[14:07] <ikonia> ndlovu: make sure you have no PPA's enabled
[14:07] <avelldiroll> blogorge: what do you mean by "using ubuntu as root" ? you were logged in as root on an X session ?
[14:07] <ndlovu> ikonia, I have commented them all out, but I'm not sure what ppa-purge does that's different?
[14:08] <ikonia> ndlovu: that will remove all dependencies (hopefully) installed by the PPA
[14:08] <schnuffle> ndlovu: it uninstall packages
[14:08] <Mandalord> Jacta: well since you have downloaded and installed all the necessary libs, i think our jobs is to find out the right location of those lib and correct the config.linux, then make install
[14:08] <ndlovu> ikonia, schnuffle, are you saying I should run ppa-purge before reinstalling samba?
[14:09] <ikonia> ndlovu: worth trying it
[14:09] <myhero> ActionParsnip: u there ??
[14:09] <schnuffle> ndlovu: +1
[14:09] <ikonia> ndlovu: others rate it highly, I'm not convinced personally, but it's worth a try
[14:09] <ActionParsnip> myhero: not sure of the syntax, but i'm sure its possible

[14:11] <Jacta> Mandalord: i dont have /usr/lib/glib-2.0/ but I have /usr/include/glib-2.0
[14:11] <Jacta> so, first one is correct path - second = not sure
[14:11] <ActionParsnip> myhero: mount the ISO, then add the mount point in sources.list
[14:11] <ndlovu> ikonia, schnuffle then would I need to then reinable the PPAs before running ppa-purge?
[14:11] <schnuffle> ndlovu: yep
[14:12] <kms11> Joshun, it's not ok at all. there are alot of things that missed now in my ubuntu
[14:12] <intrader> I would like to name the volume 'Backup' to be used in linux 12.4 'deja' backup.
[14:12] <ndlovu> schnuffle, then the process would be install ppa-purge, enable ppas, apt-get update and then apt-get purge each one?
[14:12] <schnuffle> yep
[14:13] <ndlovu> schnuffle, thanks, will give it a go
[14:14] <Joshun> kms11 - does the file manager open ok - i did warn you only to reset your config if you really needed to, after you had tested the first solution
[14:16] <ironhalik> Guys - is there an up to date PPA for Eclipse 4.x?
[14:16] <kms11> Joshun, unfortunately i reset it, but i confused  what did before that it get crazy now:( .
[14:17] <helphelphelp> so why cant i log as "Wam" then start "startx"? If its the same question for you, spare your time, dont answer
[14:17] <ikonia> helphelphelp: if you login as a non-root user and startx - what happens
[14:18] <myhero> ActionParsnip: ok..thnx
