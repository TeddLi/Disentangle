[07:39] <stones_> 21130  0:08:37 [ERROR] /usr/sbin/mysqld: Table './likeoi/ibf_sessions' is marked as crashed and should be repaired
[07:39] <stones_> 121130 yep, current... thats todays date actually
[07:40] <somsip> stones_: So I'd suggest looking at mysqlcheck/myisamchk and getting that sorted for a start
[07:40] <stones_> Is there a way I could repair the dbs without starting SQL? Might be a dumb question...?
[07:40] <somsip> stones_: using one of the two commands in my last comment :)
[07:41] <Kartagis> if I attempt to initialise an already in use partition for use by LVM with pvcreate, will that destroy the partition?
[07:42] <blackshirt> Hello
[07:42] <stones_> myisamchk? would that work? Do I have to repair EACH table at a time?
[07:43] <stones_> do I have to go through the logs and see which ones needed repairing or is there a way to check/repair all dbs automatically?
[07:43] <stones_> i appreciate your help btw ;)
[07:43] <somsip> stones_: I don't have experience of these so I would be looking up the answer for you. You would use myisamchk is you use MYISAM tables, so I suspect mysqlcheck for INNODB. And maybe you should fix the broken table first - likeoi DB, ibf_sessions table
[07:43] <somsip> stones_: could be a --repair-all option. Dunno
[07:43] <stones_> argh this gets more confusing
[07:43] <stones_> how do I know if im using innodb?
[07:43] <iceroot> stones_: also have a look at #mysql
[07:43] <stones_> I believe I am, but obviously want to make sure
[07:44] <somsip> stones_: don't know. I know my DBs, so I know what I use
[07:44] <stones_> is there a way to verify?

[07:44] <wopsk1> how do i setup internet sharing on ubuntu 12.04 can ne1 help
[07:45] <somsip> stones_: probably, but I'm not searching it for you
[07:45] <stones_> just checked

[07:46] <peter_> is it repository or just package storage? http://packages.debian.org/unstable/editors/bless
[07:46] <wopsk1> help ne1?
[07:46] <somsip> stones_: different tables in the same DB can use different engines. INNODB engine might be started if it's not disabled in my.cnf
[07:46] <iceroot> peter_: its not the repo, also its debian not ubuntu, dont mix the packages

[07:47] <ubottu> wopsk1: If you want to share the internet connection of your Ubuntu machine with other machines in the network see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing
[07:47] <peter_> iceroot: ok, thanks
[07:47] <stones_> i just dont want to mess anything up here
[07:47] <somsip> stones_: understandable. You should be careful
[07:48] <stones_> whats the best way to make a copy of the dbs first?
[07:48] <somsip> stones_: sudo cp -R /var/lib/mysql ~/Temp/
[07:49] <stones_> mysqlcheck is similar in function to myisamchk, but works differently.
[07:49] <stones_>        The main operational difference is that mysqlcheck must be used when
[07:49] <stones_>        the mysqld server is running,
[07:49] <wopsk1> tried that but no luck is there a program in software center u kno of
[07:49] <stones_> so neither is for InnoDB or myisam..
[07:50] <bazhang> !work | wopsk1
[07:50] <ubottu> wopsk1: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[07:51] <somsip> stones_: some info here, but you should be finding this yourself. I'm trying to help but this is not #mysql http://www.softwareprojects.com/resources/programming/t-how-to-fix-mysql-database-myisam-innodb-1634.html
[07:52] <wopsk1> ur right didnt think ne1 was listening well it dosen't make sense it says go to settings-network-wireless but i dont have a menu on 12.04
[07:54] <wopsk1> i can click on the wireless icon on the top right i dont have an option to create an ad hoc network and thats ot even what i want to do i want to set it up as a hotspot
[07:58] <wopsk1> if i cant setup internet sharing on ubuntu ill be forced to go back to windows...
[07:58] <stones_> OK so SQL runs fine once I stop Apache2
[07:58] <stones_> processlist only shows myself in it
[07:58] <somsip> stones_: is this a live site that you're running?
[08:00] <stones_> yeah
[08:01] <somsip> stones_: and are users hitting the site when apache is running. And would this generate queries to the DB?
[08:01] <Kartagis> if I attempt to initialise an already in use partition for use by LVM with pvcreate, will that destroy the partition?
[08:01] <stones_> started sql first then started apache2
[08:01] <stones_> load average: 0.47, 0.46, 0.55
[08:01] <somsip> stones_: so is your problem solved?
[08:01] <stones_> is there something i can leave open to monitor just in case the load spikes again?
[08:02] <somsip> stones_: who is your host?
[08:02] <stones_> friend of mine
[08:02] <somsip> stones_: ssh with top running then
[08:03] <helmut_> hi

[08:08] <Kartagis> if I attempt to initialise an already in use partition for use by LVM with pvcreate, will that destroy the partition?
[08:08] <qkit> let say i ssh in to a device , and i wanted to save all the command that i type in that ssh session. How can i save it? if i'm using terminal to ssh in?
[08:09] <somsip> qkit: use something like screen, tmux, byobu
[08:09] <qkit> oh, thanks somsip
[08:09] <somsip> qkit: np
[08:09] <BlackWeb> Does anyone know of a good Video Streamer Over WAn?
[08:11] <tafelpoot> qkit: you can just type 'history' and you'll see all your commands, or in ~/.bash_history
[08:11] <boichev> BlackWeb, VLC
[08:11] <tafelpoot> no udev professionals here? :(
[08:12] <qkit> tafelpoot: but that is already inside the ssh session
[08:13] <BlackWeb> I tried VLC, and Remote system is giving me a error
[08:13] <tafelpoot> qkit: oh, you want to save the commands you give on your local machine, not on the remote?
[08:13] <BlackWeb> I'll play with it some more and see if I can get it to work
=== desu is now known as xDesu
[08:13] <BlackWeb> so if the server goes down then in order to restream it I have to start VLC Every reboot?
[08:13] <somsip> qkit: then the answer I gave is not what you need
[08:14] <qkit> is on remote machine, let say..i want to save all the configuration on that device
[08:14] <boichev> BlackWeb, yes
[08:15] <BlackWeb> Alright,  Thanks :)
[08:15] <tafelpoot> qkit: hmmm I don't get it... so you ssh in there and type 'echo bla > /etc/myprogram/conf' and 'cd /bla' and stuff... and you want to save those?
[08:15] <tafelpoot> or really just record every letter you type?
[08:15] <qkit> ok..let say i login to a cisco device using ssh, den i run show run. i want to capture what ever that show in there
[08:15] <qkit> hmm..i think screen can do that..
[08:16] <tafelpoot> okay I see...
[08:16] <tafelpoot> qkit: you can do 'ssh mybox | tee mydumpfile'
[08:17] <qkit> oh
[08:17] <qkit> interesting..let me test
[08:17] <boichev> BlackWeb, there is a way to do it from the command line so you can add it on startup and start the stream automaticly
=== [1]hm_ is now known as hm_

[08:35] <tafelpoot> no udev guys around?
[08:35] <stones_> well I see that table/db a bunch of times
[08:36] <somsip> stones_: does the server have enough resources to be able to handle this DB?

[08:37] <pr3d4t0r> Q. apt-get update errors:  http://eugeneciurana.com/pastebin/pastebin.php?show=45586 - MergeList, dependency.  Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS.  I can't update or upgrade because of this error -- how to solve it?  Vanilla Ubuntu server otherwise.
[08:37] <somsip> stones_: so your schema has problems ore the config is poor or the server is underpowered
[08:37] <pr3d4t0r> The dependency is something in Gnome - which is strange, since this is a headless machine.
[08:38] <MonkeyDust> pr3d4t0r  #ubuntu-server
[08:39] <stones_> yeah ram usage is 90%
[08:39] <pr3d4t0r> MonkeyDust: Gracias.
[08:39] <stones_> but i thought something was causing it to spike up
[08:39] <Sail> pr3d4t0r: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1685409
[08:39] <pr3d4t0r> MonkeyDust: I figured it out -- just nuke /var/lib/apt/lists/*
[08:39] <pr3d4t0r> Sail: Checking.
[08:40] <pr3d4t0r> MonkeyDust: This isn't a problem specific to server anyway -- it's a package manager issue.
[08:41] <somsip> stones_: so you need to find out what it is. Troubleshooting servers like this can get complex and it's not something I'm prepared to cover with you here. But maybe you should check indexes on the tables and try to solve your slow queries. But ultimately, you might just find the server is underpowered.
[08:41] <pr3d4t0r> Sail: Right - similar to what I found.  Just force apt to re-read all package lists.  Thanks for your help :)
[08:42] <pr3d4t0r> Have a nice day, guys.

[08:44] <Surye> is there a way to, remotely via ssh, enable a full VNC session (connect to the login screen, login, have a full session)? I can't seem to find a conclusive answer online
[08:46] <RiXtEr> Surye, if you are connecting with another *nix machine (using X) you can ssh -X user@host and when something needs X it will pull only that app up on your screen.

[08:52] <iceroot> tizxxx: ifconfig is reading the current network settings which can be set via interfaces, network-manager and so on

[09:33] <ExUnixGuru> IS MB RAID
[09:33] <ExUnixGuru> sorry
[09:34] <ExUnixGuru> bumped cap lock
[09:34] <phix> ExUnixGuru: MB RAID, so it is software raid
[09:34] <RiXtEr> ExUnixGuru, so your using a hardware raid (configured by the motherboard?)
[09:34] <phix> ExUnixGuru: is it a server motherboard or a desktop motherboard?
[09:34] <killer1> ActionParsnip : i know that this way i will get source but how do i know how many packages or what packages i need to compile as a standard ubuntu distro
[09:34] <ExUnixGuru> likelely is firmware raid from  biios. has several RAiIIDed sets
[09:35] <phix> RiXtEr: most likely it isnt a desktop mobo so chances are it is firmware + drivers that does the raid
[09:35] <ExUnixGuru> Windows uses a driver during install
[09:35] <ActionParsnip> killer1: there are loads. You don't just "compile a distro", it takes ages, compiling each package that makes up the OS.
[09:35] <phix> firmware for the config and drivers / modules to do the actual raiding
[09:35] <ExUnixGuru> correct
[09:35] <RiXtEr> phix, agreed.
[09:35] <phix> RiXtEr: msot liekly it is a desktop mobo even
[09:35] <phix> typo
[09:35] <RiXtEr> ExUnixGuru, so google search for the module that needs loaded on boot.
[09:36] <phix> hey should I get peperoni or lamb shank meat pizza?
[09:36] <ExUnixGuru> but how do I  get that into the  Ubuntu installer

[09:36] <ExUnixGuru> II believe the MFG has the drivers
[09:36] <ExUnixGuru> for linux
[09:36] <killer1> ActionParsnip: u compiled a distro ever?(by compiling packages needed)
[09:37] <ExUnixGuru> what it does is - hang with an error
[09:37] <ExUnixGuru> refuses tpo  install
[09:37] <ActionParsnip> killer1: I've used gentoo, so technically yes
[09:37] <RiXtEr> ExUnixGuru, a google search for loading (your firmwaretype here) driver on linux livecd might help
[09:37] <MonkeyDust> !google
[09:37] <ubottu> While Google is useful for helpers, many newer users don't have the google-fu yet. Please don't tell people to "google it" when they ask a question.

[10:01] <dr_willis> 3.7 is in the next release? ive not tried it
[10:02] <MonkeyDust> yeah, guess 3.7 is for raring
[10:02] <MonkeyDust> Andy80  what's the output of lsb_release -sd ?
[10:02] <auronandace> MonkeyDust: 3.5.0-19 recently came out, i just upgrades (just so you know)
[10:03] <Andy80> MonkeyDust, andrea@andrea-Inspiron-660:~$ lsb_release -sd

=== exed_ is now known as exed
[10:04] <media-centre> good morning peeps
[10:04] <Andy80> is it possible that this package comes from a PPA?
[10:04] <media-centre> got a new problem for you
[10:04] <dr_willis> Andy80:  possuble
[10:04] <Andy80> and how can I detect which "deb" line caused this? There must be a way to know it
[10:05] <dr_willis> see what synaptic shows
[10:06] <dr_willis> it can show packages based on what repo
[10:06] <media-centre> logictech webcam wont show on ubuntu
=== tobias is now known as Guest68075
[10:06] <Andy80> dr_willis, it says "(quantal)"
[10:07] <Andy80> uhm... no wait wait...
[10:07] <dr_willis> bottom left in synapitic has a show by source button
[10:07] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: if you run: cheese    does it show?
[10:08] <media-centre> no
[10:08] <Andy80> damn it... it was the  "xorg-edgers" -.-'
[10:08] <media-centre> not even on benchmark
[10:09] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: can you pastebin the output of:  lsb_release -a; uname -a; lsusb
[10:09] <thesadmafioso> Will linux-image-3.0.0-27-generic work for 10.04 LTS?
[10:09] <media-centre> i did go on some of the forums some of them did give me drivers but they for older kernels
[10:09] <Andy80> ok, I will "force version"
[10:09] <thesadmafioso> I know it's not the most current and I know I need to get a newer distro SOON.
[10:10] <ActionParsnip> thesadmafioso: it may, but the kernel will not be supported heer
=== pp is now known as Guest31465
[10:10] <thesadmafioso> ActionParsnip: Why is that? Just curious.
[10:11] <ActionParsnip> thesadmafioso: only the packages from the official repos for your release can be supoprted here
[10:11] <thesadmafioso> ActionParsnip: Is there a kernel version 3.0 or greater available in the repos for 10.04? How could I check that with apt-get or apt-cache?
[10:11] <media-centre> heres the output
[10:11] <media-centre> http://pastebin.com/wvkm4tH7
[10:12] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: is it a touchscreen PC?
[10:12] <media-centre> no
[10:12] <almoxarife> sooner or later the question will come up, what can i do on linux-lxde(buntu) that i wont ever be able to do on an android?
[10:13] <media-centre> just a pc with a tv for a monitor
[10:13] <llutz> almoxarife: "not much"
[10:13] <media-centre> brb
[10:14] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: if you run:  lsmod | grep uvc   do you get an output?
[10:15] <dr_willis> android is more  "sandboxed"/locked down. i guess would be a major differance
[10:15] <media-centre> wait their
[10:15] <thesadmafioso> Ah, seems that at least kernel image 3.0.0-13 is supported with 10.04 LTS; do I need any backports? apt is suggesting that I get some sort of Oneiric backport sources?
[10:15] <media-centre> no none
[10:15] <dr_willis> !backports
[10:15] <ubottu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they may go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports - See also !packaging
[10:16] <almoxarife> dr_willis: i installed lxde on the android, i am stripping lxde of everything the android does already, and i wont have much of the lxde left to even make it worth having it
[10:17] <Walther> So, uh, any news on nvidia-experimental-310 repackaging so that it would provide nvidia-current?
[10:17] <Walther> because currently installing nvidia-experimental-310 uninstalls bumblebee
[10:18] <dr_willis> almoxarife:   depends on your needs i guess.
[10:18] <dr_willis> not all linux apps are ported to android. ;-)
[10:19] <thesadmafioso> dr_willis: I see a kernel version for 10.04 in the repos, and the backports pertaining to Oneiric are only "suggested" ; I may be fine without getting them, and if they were truly necessary they would be dependencies, yes?
[10:21] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: try:  sudo modprobe uvcvideo
[10:21] <dr_willis> backpprts are a special case  i gurss you can say
[10:21] <almoxarife> why are so many people fixating on keeping 10.04 alive?, is that the magic distro for something i dont know about?
[10:22] <ActionParsnip> almoxarife: could just run openbox on it's own (no DE), should be lighter
[10:22] <dr_willis> they cling to the gnome....
[10:22] <thesadmafioso> I am actually just in a position where it's better for me not to go trying a new distro; I'm limited in what I can do if things go wrong because of where I am/what I have at my disposal.
[10:22] <almoxarife> dr_willis: gnome2? that it?
[10:22] <thesadmafioso> I like the gnome2!
=== vincent is now known as Guest52225
[10:23] <thesadmafioso> Isn't there some point during the boot process where you can press SHIFT and manually select your kernel version?

[10:24] <MonkeyDust> [3;2~
[10:24] <dr_willis> thesadmafioso:  at the start. or set the grub menu to not hide.
[10:24] <almoxarife> i went from gnome2 to kde, have not looked back
[10:25] <thesadmafioso> All right, well as long as I can do that I should be fine. Off to try this thing out.

[10:26] <A_I_> hi
[10:26] <A_I_> what means this regexp ?  : [-/%.0-9a-z]
[10:27] <Andy80> uff... I've disable the xorg-edgers PPA. Now if I want to remove the linux*3.7 packages, it also asks me to remove the metapackages like: linux-generic* and linux-headers, how can I avoid it?
[10:27] <dzhus> good day, can I run an upstart init script if it's symlinked to another location?
[10:27] <Andy80> I just want to remove linux 3.7 packages
[10:27] <dzhus> like ~/.init/foo.conf -> ~/system-scripts/foo.conf
[10:27] <Walther> So, uh, any news on nvidia-experimental-310 repackaging so that it would provide nvidia-current? At the moment installing the 310 drivers uninstalls bumblebee
[10:27] <dr_willis> theres a ppa-purge tool i belive
[10:28] <dzhus> upstart seems to not see the script at alll
[10:28] <media-centre> ActionParsnip: ive done sudo modprobe uvcvideo
[10:28] <media-centre> and it hasnt shown anything
[10:28] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: you may need a udev rule to tell it that the sunplus ID is a webcam
[10:29] <media-centre> ok so im editing a file for astartters i guess
[10:29] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: possibly
[10:29] <MonkeyDust> A_I_  it means 'all characters from 0-9 and from a-z plus the % sign'
[10:30] <media-centre> well im not exactly expert at all of this
[10:30] <media-centre> so
[10:30] <media-centre> youll have to take me through step by step
[10:31] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: gksudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/jj-video.rules
[10:31] <A_I_> MonkeyDust and the slash "/" sign too noo ?
[10:31] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: add:      SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="045e", ATTR{idProduct}=="072d", ACTION=="add", GROUP="audio", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/webcam-mic"
[10:31] <A_I_> what means the minus sign "-" ?
[10:31] <media-centre> ok the file is blank
[10:32] <ActionParsnip> but change the idProduct to 05ca and the idVendor to: 1bcf
[10:32] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: wait a sec, i'll neaten this up
[10:32] <media-centre> ok
[10:33] <media-centre> thank you for this
[10:33] <MonkeyDust> A_I_  the / is used to indicate 'as is', so not as a symbol

[11:26] <andis> how do i get that regf

[11:28] <media-centre> the only time i got it working was by a script for skype

[11:29] <ananymusss> i formatted a 2.0gb partition of my usb stick into FAT and then used that installer (without having the installer's format option selected)
[11:29] <media-centre> im gonna see what was in that script

[11:29] <ActionParsnip> ananymusss: have you tried the device in a different PC?
[11:30] <ananymusss> yes, my laptop
[11:30] <ananymusss> should i try to use FAT32 instead of FAT?
[11:31] <ActionParsnip> ananymusss: yes, use FAT32
[11:31] <Touhou11> ananymusss: Have you tried ReiserFS?
[11:32] <ananymusss> no sir
[11:32] <Touhou11> Wouldn't recommend it
[11:32] <MonkeyDust> Touhou11  FAT is readable by most systems, my manual here says reiserFS is not really fit for ubuntu

[12:05] <Bustacap> If I don't have a blank dvd, can I just extract the iso to a new partition, flag it as boot, and remove the boot flag from the current boot partition?
[12:05] <media-centre> cant think of anything
[12:06] <ActionParsnip> Bustacap: grub2 can boot ISO files
[12:07] <Bustacap> ActionParsnip: I love how you are always here and know everything.
[12:07] <Bustacap> Lol.
[12:07] <Bustacap> How do I go about doing that?
[12:07] <media-centre> not everything

[12:15] <trackerproblem> ActionParsnip I get the same problem, are dns servers blocking torrent trackers?
[12:15] <regf> Bustacap: it depends what are you trying to boot
[12:15] <ActionParsnip> trackerproblem: no idea, sorry

[12:16] <trackerproblem> ActionParsnip nope
[12:16] <media-centre> have they cancelled it or somthing
[12:16] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: you need to enable the partner repo

[12:18] <ActionParsnip> empty: surely thats the first thing to try....?
[12:18] <regf> Bustacap: it will be looking for the real CD/DVD drive
[12:18] <Bustacap> regf: That's why I was thinking of just extracting the iso to the partition I plan on installing it on and marking it as the only thing with boot flags.
[12:19] <regf> Bustacap: marking it bootable is not enough
[12:20] <regf> Bustacap: you also need a partition bootloader and its configuration
[12:21] <empty> ActionParsnip i ping the server its responding.but still unable to connect to the network
[12:21] <Bustacap> regf: Doesn't the iso have a boot config?
[12:22] <regf> Bustacap: booting CD/DVD is a different process than booting a HD partition
[12:22] <Bustacap> True.
[12:23] <Bustacap> Brb. Gonna try something.
[12:23] <Kartagis> would using pvcreate on an already existing partition wreck it?
[12:24] <Ny0> hi everyone, you know if there is a way to backup windows partitions (with bootloader, ecc) on dvd using ubuntu live ?
[12:25] <ikonia> Ny0: look at clonezilla live cd
[12:25] <ActionParsnip> Ny0: you can make an image of the MBR using dd, then backup the data
[12:27] <regf> Ny0: many ways - copying whole block device with dd-like tool, copying only used parts with ntfsclone, or even copying just files if you're careful about preserving all file attributes
[12:29] <regf> I don't think preserving MBR is important if it's a standard Windows MBR, it can easily be restored with testdisk for example
[12:30] <Ny0> regf: it's a damn win8 notebook without dvd restore -.-'
[12:30] <Ny0> i'm trying to avoid this problem by doing backup in other ways
[12:30] <Ny0> with xp i remember it was easy to restore mbr
[12:30] <pecc> my sound disappears randomly, disconnect/reconnect dock helps but only for some time
[12:31] <pecc> afaik i have upgraded drivers etc
[12:31] <Ny0> regf: but in this case is more complex because there is lenovo oneclick recovery
[12:31] <tizz> i'm having some trouble making a desktop file to run an sh, how do i run the desktopfile validatation tool
[12:32] <Bustacap> It worked hmmm
[12:32] <Bustacap> Installing as we speak
[12:32] <Ny0> regf: so is not a standard windows mbr -.-'
[12:33] <Bustacap> Just extracted and marked the partition as boot
[12:33] <Bustacap> Can't wait till its installed so I can get back to ubuntu lol
[12:33] <regf> Ny0: hmm, Win8 may be tricky due to secureboot, GUID partition table and all that stuff
[12:34] <regf> Bustacap: nice, good to know it's smart enough to work that way :)
[12:34] <Bustacap> So far lol
[12:35] <xyzone> secureboot machines are boned
[12:35] <psychopathic> i work over time at 1 unit.
[12:36] <Ny0> regf: its a big deal but i'd really like to modify part table preserving the possibility to restore the notebook one day
[12:36] <media-centre> does anyone know why i cant change the permissions on an a .sh file
[12:36] <media-centre> for some reason its not letting me
[12:36] <Ny0> regf: in this moment it is a useless pc
[12:36] <media-centre> i miss linux mint
[12:37] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: how, its still actively developed.
[12:37] <regf> Ny0: I would probably image the whole disk just in case there are some important bits hidden somewhere
[12:37] <media-centre> but it wont load as a program
[12:37] <media-centre> brb
[12:39] <Ny0> regf: 500 gb O.o
[12:39] <regf> Ny0: compress it with gzip (or maybe lzop because it's faaaast)
[12:39] <regf> Ny0: most of it is probably filled with zeroes if it's new
[12:40] <regf> Ny0: or copy it to a sparse file
[12:41] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: how do you mean 'as a program'?
[12:41] <ActionParsnip> media-centre: do you mean wubi?
[12:41] <Ny0> regf: i will try
[12:41] <media-centre> NO
[12:41] <Ny0> regf: tnx
=== mrenouf|away is now known as mrenouf

[13:22] <phix> sudo is great
[13:22] <danielbauwens> Okay thanks guys

[13:22] <phix> llutz_: ?
[13:22] <phix> It wasnt random
[13:22] <phix> it was very specific
[13:23] <psychopathic> they smoke weed on velocity radian.
[13:23] <phix> nothing wrong with sudo, that is a true, if skype is lously programmed that it requires root access to run then why not run it via sudo
[13:23] <llutz_> phix: still nonsense
[13:23] <phix> llutz_: no sense
[13:23] <xyzone> don't use skype
[13:24] <phix> you get that, software providers being used to writting windows apps being lazy and not implementing usermode correctly
[13:24] <phix> so it requires root / admin access to run
[13:24] <phix> fair enough
[13:24] <llutz_> skype mightto be avoided but it neither needs root-right nor should it be run as root
[13:24] <phix> llutz_: it does if it was programmed so
[13:25] <Slart> skype doesn't require root for me.. runs just fine here as a regular user
[13:25] <llutz_> phix: it wasn't
[13:25] <sidd_mak> plz suggest some package which can recover deleted files from FAT file system.
[13:25] <phix> I dont know, I dont use it, but I wouldnt be suprised if it does

[13:29] <sidd_mak> Myrtti xyzone llutz_ : thanks guys....
[13:29] <phix> who else lkes robert kirkman's work on ubuntu?
[13:29] <fahim> but not a very new ubuntu user.
[13:30] <fishcooker> i dont think so fahim
[13:31] <regf> sidd_mak: photorec is for recovering files from any filesystem, I don't know if it uses any FS information besides free space ; if you just want FAT undelete, testdisk may be a better option
[13:31] <fahim> what do you think? fishcooker
[13:31] <regf> sidd_mak: there is undelete option in advanced menu
[13:34] <fahim> fishcooker are you there?
[13:34] <fishcooker> yes
[13:35] <knoppix> i have 3g  usb modem,  how unmount 3g modem cd driver
[13:35] <deffrag> Hi! I'm using IDE/SATA to USB adapter which uses external power supply like - http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-TO-IDE-SATA-S-SATA-Converter-CABLE-Adaptor-w-POWER-/220764567409? - I've connected 750GB HDD to the adapter but I'm not able to get it working on Ubuntu 12.04. dmesg, lsusb, fdisk -l logs: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1399099/ . How can I fix it please?
[13:35] <Slart> knoppix: if it's a kernel driver you might be able to unload it using modprobe
[13:36] <media-centre_> well i got it to execute
[13:36] <media-centre_> but it still aint making the webcam load up
[13:36] <llutz_> deffrag: according to your logs, it is detected. sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
[13:37] <knoppix> Slart, ok . thank you.
[13:37] <deffrag> llutz, Hi, I can see its detected and I tried that command but it asked for proper filesystem. I ran blkid and then gparted to get proper filesystem but it didn't help
[13:38] <llutz_> deffrag: sudo fsck /dev/sdb1
[13:38] <xyzone> deffrag, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=966321&page=2
[13:39] <regf> deffrag: don't do any fsck!
[13:39] <regf> deffrag: the disk isn't detected properly!
[13:39] <deffrag> llutz, Forgot to give blkid log - http://paste.ubuntu.com/1399106/ . Why is there a need to check and repair fs using fsck?
[13:40] <deffrag> regf, I haven't yet
[13:40] <regf> deffrag: your USB interface is lying
[13:40] <regf> deffrag: it says the disk has 4K logical sector size, while it should be 512 bytes
[13:41] <deffrag> xyzone, Thanks, I'll go through that. regf : How so?
[13:41] <fishcooker> i wanto mounting spesific partition
[13:41] <fishcooker> as home
[13:41] <fishcooker> rather than using single partition
[13:41] <regf> deffrag: I don't know if there is any way to override it
[13:41] <fishcooker> should i rsync /home folder manually to the new partition
[13:44] <regf> deffrag: I guess you could modify partition table to fit if your partitions were 4k aligned, but they are not
[13:44] <deffrag> regf, Possible. I tried another 2.5" HDD and it worked easily opening the file manager
[13:44] <MonkeyDust> media-centre_ did the chmod trick help?
[13:45] <deffrag> regf, I'm not sure what could have caused that issue to 750GB drive
[13:45] <deffrag> It was working fine and is used as booting device on the desktop machine
[13:46] <deffrag> booted fine on desktop in past, I mean
[13:46] <oddie> is there a fix for the left menu bar to appear when in auto hide? I can press super and it appears, If I take off autohide it is fine?.. as soon as I click on hide through compiz-settings-manager it hides and mouse wont release it back. Any help?
[13:47] <regf> deffrag: older hard drives may be detected properly by your USB adapter, never drives - 512k logical / 4k physical may be mangled to 4k logical / 4k phys.
[13:47] <deffrag> llutz, regf : Sorry I forgot to mention that the /home on it is encrypted... is that causing the issue/
[13:48] <regf> deffrag: your USB adapter is probably lying intentionally, they do it to make bigger drives than 2TB work on Windows
[13:48] <deffrag> regf, Both the drive 2.5" are newer
[13:48] <regf> deffrag: it's a trick to make 2TB+ drives accessible with msdos partition table
[13:48] <deffrag> And the adapter is working fine for another new 2.5" drive
[13:48] <deffrag> well
[13:49] <Walther> Is the nvidia-experimental-310 going to be repackaged any time soon? It does not provide nvidia-current, causing bumblebee to uninstall
[13:49] <regf> deffrag: it's probably working fine for drives with 512k log. / 512 k phys. sector size
[13:49] <regf> deffrag: and it's probably lying for 512k log / 4 k phys
[13:50] <regf> deffrag: either connect the drive directly without the USB adapter, or buy an adapter which doesn't mangle sector sizes
[13:50] <deffrag> regf, sector size detected for first is 4096bytes and second working one is 512bytes
[13:51] <Walther> !package nvidia-experimental-310
[13:51] <deffrag> Okay
[13:51] <phix> The plot thickens
[13:51] <ActionParsnip> !info nvidia-experimental-310 | Walther
[13:51] <ubottu> Walther: Package nvidia-experimental-310 does not exist in quantal
[13:51] <regf> deffrag: yep, that's what I thought
[13:51] <deffrag> regf, I'll try connecting it directly to laptop
[13:51] <Walther> Ehh?
[13:51] <subdesign> hey, can i combine Krusader splitted large file with windows Total Commander ?
[13:51] <Walther> Anyway, who is maintaining that package?
[13:51] <reels> Hi, sscanf() seems buggy in ubuntu LTS (10.04, 12.04). Test program works well on other systems apparently : http://ideone.com/bKiiwY  . Any idea why ? Thanks.
[13:52] <Walther> It needs a rebuild; it doesn't provide 'nvidia-current', causing a big issue with bumblebee
[13:52] <ActionParsnip> Walther: try http://packages.ubuntu.com
[13:52] <deffrag> regf, Can encryption report wrong sector size to protect or something?
[13:53] <llutz_> Walther: apt-cache show nvidia-current|grep -i maint
[13:53] <media-centre_> what i cant understand is why of all the webcams does that one decide to not work
[13:53] <media-centre_> i mean is it loyal to microshit
[13:54] <xyzone> media-centre, because no drivers
[13:54] <media-centre_> oh their are drivers
[13:54] <ikonia> media-centre_: drop the language/attitude
[13:54] <media-centre_> their just just for older kernals
[13:54] <media-centre_> mind you thats an idea
[13:55] <regf> deffrag: don't confuse encryption block with hard drive sector size
[13:55] <media-centre_> cos im sure their are .so files in the drivers that ican just pick one of them to get it working

[13:57] <ikonia> phix: the language is unacceptable,

[13:58] <ikonia> phix: the channel has rules on offensive language, then include no cursing, that's why he was pulled up on it
[13:59] <phix> ikonia: I wasn't offended
[13:59] <ikonia> phix: it's not "my" rules, it's the channels, you're welcome to request discussion on it through the operators team
[13:59] <phix> ok, lets discuss
[13:59] <ikonia> phix: it doesn't matter if you are offended or not in that respect, the channels rules are no cursing, if you are not happy with those rules a.) raise it as a concern to the operators team b.) don't use the channel
[13:59] <phix> ikonia: I prefer a over b
[13:59] <phix> I like using this channel
[13:59] <ikonia> phix: I'll pm you the email address of the ubuntu IRC council and you can send you concerns to them

[14:03] <worm> Does anyone know how to install skype on my x86_64 12.10 Ubuntu? apt-get shows that skype is not available.
[14:03] <phix> ActionParsnip: I Only liked enlightenment in Mandrake
[14:03] <OerHeks> worm, enable partner repo

[14:04] <xyzone> I started on ubuntu 5.10
[14:04] <worm> Thanks a lot.

[14:05] <phix> why use skype for?
[14:05] <worm> ActionParsnip: I see. I'll try that.
[14:05] <ActionParsnip> phix: chat to other skype users
[14:05] <phix> skype is a service, asterisk is a full package
[14:05] <phix> use asteriak
[14:05] <phix> it is ubuntu too
[14:05] <phix> skype is out of topic
[14:05] <ActionParsnip> phix: to chat to skype users using voice?
[14:06] <xyzone> I wonder why the 32-bit is still recommended
[14:06] <phix> ActionParsnip: out of topic
[14:06] <Pici> phix: stop it
[14:06] <ActionParsnip> phix: its in the official ubuntu partner repo, so is supported
[14:06] <phix> Pici: ? who are you?
[14:06] <phix> ActionParsnip: nah asterisk is supported more though
[14:06] <phix> by ubuntu and debian
[14:06] <ikonia> phix: drop it please.
[14:06] <ikonia> you're causing a problem
[14:07] <Pici> phix: You're misleading users, and annoying the helpers.
[14:07] <phix> ikonia: I am not causing a problem
[14:07] <phix> I am a helper
[14:07] <phix> Pici: I am helping
[14:07] <ikonia> you're not helping, please slow down and think about what you are saying
[14:07] <phix> ikonia: I am, asterisk is the full package, skype is just a service
[14:07] <xDesu> I just hope whoever doesn't get the multiarch issue with x64 I experienced on 12.10.
[14:07] <phix> you have no source control with skype
[14:07] <ikonia> phix: yes, he ants to use skype
[14:07] <phix> you do with asterisk
[14:07] <ikonia> it's supported
[14:08] <ikonia> you can offer suggestions for other packages, but please, don't make things up
[14:08] <ActionParsnip> xDesu: in what package?
[14:08] <phix> ikonia: hmmmm
=== Zorro is now known as Guest17861
[14:08] <phix> ikonia: I am making things up?
[14:08] <xDesu> ActionParsnip, it was an issue with multiarch not being enabled on my system by default so I couldn't install skype.
[14:08] <phix> ikonia: it is true though
[14:08] <ActionParsnip> phix: this channel supports packages from teh official ubuntu repos. The partner repor IS an official repo, its just disabled by default
[14:08] <ikonia> phix: when you said skype is "off topic"
[14:09] <ActionParsnip> phix: as skype is in that repo, it is supported here. Clear enough?
[14:09] <Guest17861> Hello
[14:09] <xDesu> Guest17861, hi there.
[14:09] <phix> ActionParsnip: ok it is supported, I am not arguing that, I am arguing that asterisk is the better choice, it is also supported and in the repo
[14:10] <ActionParsnip> xDesu: if use 64bit in newer releases, it is enabled by default, your OS should puul in 32bit deps to satisfy thet deps
[14:10] <Guest17861> how are you xdesu
[14:10] <xDesu> Guest17861, you may want to change your name(if you don't know how "/nick <name>
[14:10] <phix> ikonia: ah ok
[14:10] <phix> ikonia: well ActionParsnip argued / debated another point
[14:10] <ActionParsnip> phix: that's fine, but saying 'skype is out of topic' is incorrect, isn't it?
[14:10] <Guest17861> Ace
[14:10] <phix> ikonia: I agree now it is supported, I just looked it up :)
[14:10] <xDesu> ActionParsnip, it wasn't enabled on my copy of 12.10, but don't worry I have long since resolved the issue.
[14:10] <phix> ActionParsnip: yes, but it isn't the best choice
[14:11] <ikonia> that's debatable
[14:11] <ikonia> it's personal opnion
[14:11] <ikonia> opinion
[14:11] <ActionParsnip> xDesu: if you use apt-get it should work ok. aptitude doesn't play taht way
[14:11] <phix> asterisk is far superior
[14:11] <xDesu> ActionParsnip, I had to run
[14:11] <ActionParsnip> phix: that's not the issue at hand. You said it's "out of topic", which is wrong. Isn't it
[14:11] <phix> ikonia: really? is it a personal opionion that you can use asterisk as a full blown PBX? and have access to the source?
[14:11] <ActionParsnip> phix: if it's ontopic, why say it's not?
[14:12] <ikonia> phix: please stop now, I'm getting board
[14:12] <Guest17861> can you speak german xdesu
[14:12] <phix> ActionParsnip: I thought it wasnt as skype is very commerial
[14:12] <ikonia> phix: the user wanted to connect to skype - he wanted the skype clients
[14:12] <xDesu> ActionParsnip, I had to run "dpkg --add-architecture i386 && apt-get install ia32-libs" the issue has already been resolved though so don't worry about it.
[14:12] <Pici> phix: asterisk is not a replacement for skype for someone who wants to chat to skype users.
[14:12] <phix> ActionParsnip: I forget that ubuntu doesnt have the same values as debian

[14:22] <MadEchidna> Hey any X11 wizards here? I was using Ubuntu 11.10 32 bit and then a friend of mine talked me in to install 64 bit instead and it's been nothing but headaches
[14:22] <MadEchidna> On a clean install, installing the AMD video driver from the software sources applet, without any special ppas or anything, didn't work
[14:23] <MadEchidna> I was able to get it working after fudging around with x11 edgers for a few days, but yesterday I got a kernel update and no matter what I try I can't get the damn thing to work
[14:23] <MadEchidna> I keep getting this error over and over
[14:23] <MadEchidna> ERROR (dkms apport): kernel package linux-headers-3.7.0-4-generic is not supported
[14:23] <MadEchidna> Error! Bad return status for module build on kernel: 3.7.0-4-generic (x86_64)
[14:23] <khufu> are you sure it is a 64bit package?
[14:24] <MadEchidna> khufu, what do you mean?
[14:24] <khufu> well the linux-headers
[14:24] <MadEchidna> I'm just install it like normal with apt, I didn't download a deb somewhere
[14:24] <MadEchidna> how do I check?
[14:24] <ActionParsnip> MadEchidna: ask in #ubuntu+1 for raring support
[14:24] <MadEchidna> ?
[14:24] <ActionParsnip> MadEchidna: 3.7 is the raring kernel
[14:25] <Ace> guest17861
[14:27] <MadEchidna> I meant 12.10 ActionParsnip
[14:27] <MadEchidna> I don't know if that's the right channel
[14:27] <jrib> MadEchidna: you need to explain where that kernel is coming from then
[14:27] <Pici> MadEchidna: what does apt-cache policy linux-headers-3.7.0-4-generic say?
[14:27] <Siebjee> Hi guys, i am having some issues with changing the default ulimit settings. Normally you add * - nofile 65535 to /ect/security/limits.conf and when you ssh to the server your openfiles (ulimit -n) will be at 65535. But for some reason i have to manually change it with ulimit -n 65535 in order to get the limit settings i want on my server. Is there a other way to achive this ?
[14:28] <jrib> Siebjee: I think something needs to be added to pam, one sec
[14:28] <MadEchidna> Pici, http://pastebin.ca/2258650
[14:28] <MadEchidna> jrib, the default repos? I purged the PPAs I had
[14:29] <Siebjee> jrib, i already added 'session require pam_limits.so' to the /etc/pam.d/common-session
[14:30] <jrib> Siebjee: that should work afaik assuming you've defined the limits correctly
[14:30] <RickZilla> I'm using a persistent Live USB of ubuntu 12.10. If I go ahead and install it to my HD, will it keep those settings that I've already made, or will it just be a fresh install?
[14:30] <Pici> MadEchidna: That output says that you installed it from somewhere other than the default repos.  It looks like you disabled whatever source you installed it from.
[14:31] <MadEchidna> Pici, okay so how do I go back to the default kernel?
[14:31] <Siebjee> jrib, that didn't work for me. I used Ƽ* - nofile 65535' and '<username> - nofile 65535' both are not working
[14:31] <MadEchidna> when I look at the 3.7 package in synaptic it even says "Ubuntu Kernel Team", I don't get where this would have just "come from"
[14:31] <ikonia> MadEchidna: didn't you say you had the edgers repo
[14:32] <ikonia> xorg-edger ?
[14:32] <MadEchidna> I did, and then I ran a ppa-purge
[14:32] <ikonia> right, so that's why the kernel is still there
[14:32] <MadEchidna> I thought that ppa-purge took care of that
[14:32] <MadEchidna> so do I just uninstall the package?
[14:32] <jrib> Siebjee: let me try here
[14:32] <ikonia> how can it, the kernel is runing and inuse
[14:32] <Pici> MadEchidna: The safest way is to reboot to an older kernel and then remove that package.
[14:32] <MadEchidna> oh
[14:32] <MadEchidna> okay brb
[14:34] <Kartagis> what package does it take to install KDE? kdebase-bin?
[14:34] <jrib> Siebjee: actually my /etc/pam.d/sshd seems to already contain pam_limits by default
[14:35] <ikonia> Kartagis: isn't that the package ?
[14:35] <Siebjee> jrib: so does mine, but why isn't it working ?
[14:35] <xDesu> Kartagis, if you just install kde that should automatically try to satisfy depndencies.
[14:36] <RickZilla> I'm using a persistent Live USB of ubuntu 12.10. If I go ahead and install it to my HD, will it keep those settings that I've already made, or will it just be a fresh install?
[14:36] <takitez> Kartagis: you want the full set? install kubuntu-desktop   or kde-plasma-desktop for basic kde
[14:37] <Netfeed> is it possible to "upgrade sideways" from linux mint to ubuntu?

[14:37] <Netfeed> bummer
[14:37] <RickZilla> ActionParsnip: Thanks, is there a way to install otherwise?
[14:37] <jrib> Siebjee: works fine for me, all I did was add "*               -    nofile            65535" to my /etc/security/limits.conf and then "ssh localhost".  Maybe pastebin your /etc/security/limits.conf?  I didn't even touch anything in /etc/pam.d/
[14:37] <ActionParsnip> RickZilla: you could copy the contents of $HOME to an external storage and copy the data over once you get logged in
[14:38] <DJones> Netfeed: Only by a fresh install, I'd backup /home and do a fresh install and then transfer the backup to the new install
[14:38] <RickZilla> ActionParsnip: I'll look into that. Thanks for the support
[14:38] <Netfeed> alright, i hoped it was possible as they use the same base, ah well, i've got something to do this weekend then
[14:38] <dsa> hello
[14:39] <Siebjee> jrib: http://pastebin.com/NBPskses there is my limits.conf
[14:39] <RickZilla> Netfeed: I'm going back to ubuntu from LM also
[14:39] <jrib> Siebjee: seems fine.  Are both changes being ignored?
[14:39] <Siebjee> Yes
[14:40] <Netfeed> RickZilla: same "problem"? :)
[14:40] <jrib> Siebjee: you're sure there's nothing in your user's startup scripts changing the ulimit?
[14:41] <RickZilla> Netfeed: LM just acts too much like Windows, and I already have that...when I need Linux, I like the ubuntu experience a little more
[14:41] <Siebjee> jrib: only for the root user the ulimit is beeing changed as a temporary fix. But not for any other user. Only to check if they are correct or not and printing a message when they are not correct
[14:41] <jrib> Siebjee: what ubuntu version?
=== Upasna is now known as sweet_kid
[14:42] <Netfeed> RickZilla: ah, i don't use cinnamon
[14:42] <Siebjee> jrib: well its debian squeeze, but its similar to 12.04 and 11.10
[14:42] <Siebjee> jrib: and the debian community aint responding to my request
[14:42] <RickZilla> Netfeed: What problems were you having with LM?
[14:43] <ActionParsnip> Siebjee: debian isn't supported here
[14:43] <jrib> Siebjee: here's my paste since I already put it up: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1399660/ but you should ask #debian (use the oftc channel) since there may be some differences
[14:43] <Netfeed> RickZilla: i guess i will have the same problem in ubuntu, but team fortress 2 crashes :)
[14:43] <MadEchidna> Okay, I uninstalled the new kernel, and reinstalled fglrx and x11-core or whatever
[14:43] <Siebjee> ActionParsnip: i know, but please work with me. I can work with ubuntu fixes and convert them to debian
[14:43] <MadEchidna> and I think everything is working okay now, I have direct rendering and Unity runs
[14:44] <MadEchidna> it feels little slower than before but I could just be imagining things
[14:44] <Touhou11> Siebjee: Agreed, Ubuntu basically is a specific configuration of Debian after all
[14:44] <MadEchidna> thanks for your help ikonia and Pici
[14:44] <RickZilla> Does Amazon have some kind of deal with ubuntu? I noticed there was a sidebar button just for Amazon on the fresh ubuntu install
[14:44] <Nvveen> Hey all. I reinstalled Ubuntu Quantal today, but I'm having an issue with executing scripts and executables locally. I have a bash script build.sh that I can only execute with "bash build.sh" instead of "./build.sh". I have all permissions set correctly and its executable bit has been also set
[14:44] <Nvveen> In Precise, I didn't have anything like this issue
[14:44] <ActionParsnip> RickZilla: you can disable that if you want
[14:45] <xDesu> RickZilla I believe they do, but you can disable it.
[14:45] <Touhou11> RickZilla: Canonical (who make Ubuntu) get money if you click and then buy through Amazon. Amazon don't "have a deal" as such, anyone can do Amazon referral links
[14:45] <ActionParsnip> Nvveen: is the file executable?
[14:45] <RickZilla> Got it
[14:46] <MadEchidna> RickZilla, if you don't like the Amazon search results in Unity, you can disable it in the Privacy settings pane
[14:46] <ActionParsnip> Nvveen: what is the ls -la ./build.sh     output (the .sh extension isn't needed in linux)
[14:46] <Touhou11> RickZilla: There's bug reports to get similar Amazon enhancing features when searching in the terminal
[14:46] <Nvveen> ActionParsnip, yes, all permissions have been set
[14:46] <MadEchidna> just hit the ubuntu logo and type Privacy
[14:46] <RickZilla> I was thinking that if I wanted Amazon advertising I'd just get a Kindle Fire
[14:46] <MadEchidna> anyway thanks for the help guys I've got work to do now
[14:46] <spm-Draget> The 32bit Version of Ubuntu 12.04 is recommended. Any rough guess how much more instability I should expect with ubuntu 12.04 64bit? Like, is this just 'a bit less well tested' or should I relly expect occasional problems?
[14:46] <Nvveen> ActionParsnip, about the extension: It's so I myself know it's a bash script
[14:46] <southern> hey guys
[14:46] <ActionParsnip> spm-Draget: its not about stability
[14:46] <Siebjee> jrib: your settings are the same as mine, it is kind of strange why it doesn't work.
[14:47] <RickZilla> But, I don't mind supporting Canonical, so that wouldn't be a bad idea when I need to get something from Amazon anyway
[14:47] <jrib> Siebjee: we're using different OS
[14:47] <xDesu> Nvveen you can also state in the script what you wish yo run it with (e.x. #!/usr/bin/env bash)
[14:47] <southern> I have an ubuntu server 10.04 and host lookup ignores the /etc/hosts file content
[14:47] <ActionParsnip> Nvveen: is the top line in the file:   #!/bin/bash     ?
[14:47] <Nvveen> -rwxr-xr-x 1 neal neal 179 Nov 29 01:19 build.sh
[14:48] <southern> the nsswitch.conf file seems to OK
[14:48] <KI4RO> My wife's system is still at 12.04.  Do I have to wake up something in the update manager to get her to 12.10 or will it eventually figure it out and take care of it itself?
[14:48] <southern> hosts:          files dns
[14:48] <Nvveen> ActionParsnip, yes. It's also not limited to just the bash script. The executable that is made in that build script (c++ compilation) isn't executable either
[14:49] <spm-Draget> ActionParsnip: I am aware of some propetarian drivers and 64bit issues etc. But as for stability, I should expect about the same experience as in 32bit? Okay, thanks.
[14:49] <zykotick9> KI4RO: by default LTS releases only update to other LTS releases, there is some way to change that... but i don't know it.
[14:49] <KI4RO> zykes-: Thanks for the info
[14:49] <Touhou11> RickZilla: Just need to be aware that anything you search for on your local computer gets sent to Amazon... hence the privacy concerns
[14:49] <ActionParsnip> spm-Draget: yes both are equally stable. proprietary drivers are also 64bit
[14:49] <KI4RO> zykotick9: Thanks
[14:49] <Siebjee> jrib: gonna try if i can reproduce it on 12.04.1
[14:49] <ActionParsnip> Nvveen: what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
[14:50] <media-centre>  a different problem
[14:50] <xDesu> KI4RO http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/10/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-12-04-to-ubuntu-12-10
[14:50] <KI4RO> xDesu: Thanks
[14:50] <Nvveen> ActionParsnip, quantal
[14:50] <RickZilla> Touhoull: Is nothing sacred anymore? I thought that was the point of FOSS
[14:50] <media-centre> 1394 firewire card
[14:50] <media-centre> same problem dosent come up
[14:50] <southern> PLS help
[14:50] <Touhou11> RickZilla: A lot of us agree, it's reduced Ubuntu to basically adware software. Can always use Linux Mint
[14:51] <Siebjee> jrib: same problem on 12.04.1
[14:51] <jrib> Siebjee: i'm on 12.10, but I can test on 12.04.  One sec
[14:51] <zykotick9> Touhou11: RickZilla and anything you type into Unity gets sent to canonical - who then shares it with facebooka and twitter :|
[14:51] <xDesu> KI4R
[14:51] <RickZilla> zykotick9: Even if I don't have an account there?
[14:52] <Siebjee> jrib: the pam settings are okay, and i added the '*       -       nofile  65335' line to the limits.conf
[14:52] <zykotick9> RickZilla: you have an account with canonical... if you use unity ;)
[14:52] <RickZilla> true
[14:52] <media-centre> so can any of you help with that instead
[14:52] <RickZilla> I do like the ubuntu layout, so I can't argue with that
[14:53] <jrib> Siebjee: did not seem to work on 12.04 :)
[14:53] <media-centre> so can any of you help with that
[14:53] <jrib> Siebjee: erm, one sec I made a typo
[14:54] <jrib> Siebjee: works now :/
[14:54] <opieng> Does Ubuntu work ok the Raspberry Pi?
[14:54] <b0ot> Anyone know of an easy to setup cluster based instant messenging server on a private network (no internet access). I want essentially there to be one global set of users for N number of servers. I want the system to be able to work no matter what servers are online or even if the servers were seperated into two LANS each LAN would still work (obviously couldn't talk across the LANS if they werent connected but they could still provide services within thei
[14:54] <b0ot> r own LAN)
[14:54] <southern> Why my /etc/hosts file is not working on my Ubuntu 10.04?
[14:54] <jrib> southern: be more specific
[14:54] <Touhou11> southern: One second, just putting on my magic hat
[14:54] <media-centre> none of you can help with my firewire problem
[14:55] <media-centre> instead of thhat webcam problem
[14:55] <Touhou11> media-centre: Never used firewire, isn't that only used on macs?
[14:55] <media-centre> no
[14:55] <media-centre> just more popular
[14:55] <Siebjee> jrib: strange... it couldn't be the sudo access for multiple users right ?
[14:55] <jrib> Siebjee: on your 12.04, does everything look the same: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1399800/
[14:56] <southern> issuing 'host dummydomain' command returns with Host dummydomain not found: 3 (NXDOMAIN)
[14:56] <edgy> Hi, I installed ubuntu and can't make my webcam work, I don't even have a /dev/video0 device
[14:57] <southern> in /etc/hosts file there is 127.0.0.1 dummydomain record
[14:57] <southern> in nsswitch.conf file there is hosts:          files dns line
[14:58] <southern> I can't figure out the situation...
[14:58] <jrib> Siebjee: I don't see how sudo would be related
[14:58] <southern> the system is ubuntu server 10.04
[14:58] <Nvveen> Oh for god's sake, now Nautilus keeps crashing when I open my Home-folder
[14:59] <RickZilla> besides, I can only imagine what info that M$ is keeping
[14:59] <Siebjee> jrib: you're output is kind of odd, and so it your grep statement
[14:59] <jrib> southern: maybe host is behaving correctly?  Can you check what its documentation says it does?
[14:59] <jrib> Siebjee: in what way?
[14:59] <edgy> southern: what's your problem?
