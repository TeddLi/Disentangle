[02:23] <BeOSMrX> i wont be needing it, so I won't install anything either
[02:23] <biloyp> FYI use amule instead of xmule
[02:23] <nbjayme> ACU, will it allow me to convert to other formats?
[02:23] <Jae686> BenC, its was a glitch from the nick completion feature from x-chat :P
[02:23] <warpzone> been using Ubuntu for a week and loving it. Just a couple things you need to adjust.
[02:24] <Jae686> well
[02:24] <Rob_Dude> It put the headers into /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.12-10 instead of into /usr/src/linux
[02:24] <rupan3> i've been using it for a short time too, about two weeks
[02:24] <Alexi5> doesn't xmule and amule do the same thing
[02:24] <wastrel> warpzone:  you probably removed yourself from the admin group
[02:24] <Jae686> i use it since last year

[04:00] <quicken> they dont got a linux version its in c+ coding
[04:01] <Mantice> How do you install a .run file
[04:01] <eob84> quicken, if you want binary packages you have to buy it... you can compile it your self

[04:19] <nitrox> Flannelking is it faster than VNC...?
[04:19] <eob84> I am trying to run a shell script
[04:19] <Crshman> bubba_: no, not that i'm aware of, i'm pretty sure it is enabled, unless i need to set somewhere acpi=on or whatnot
[04:19] <eob84> or I mean a .run file
[04:19] <sir_quicken> ah I gotta d/l right platform binary still damn it :p
[04:19] <FlannelKing> nitrox: if you're running putty, it's native windows.
[04:19] <eob84> and it just does nothing
[04:19] <_jason> eob84: what does it do?
[04:20] <ttread> graft, it's kded
[04:20] <biovore> eob84: ./script-name?
[04:20] <eob84> it says this
[04:20] <atoponce> nitrox, text is always faster than the gui
[04:20] <eob84> Uncompressing Unreal Tournament version 428 Linux installtrap: usage: trap [-lp]  [arg signal_spec ...]
[04:20] <eob84> ut-install-428.run
[04:20] <gopi> IdleOne: packagename is ?
[04:20] <biovore> yeah.. old UT99 installer
[04:20] <mikebot> FlannelKing: do you know about installing nvidia stuff in ubuntu?
[04:20] <bubba_> Crshman, acpi runs things like your battery monitor... check that out... i had issues with my acpi, and had to tweek  a bunch of things...
[04:20] <nitrox> Flannelking: I got a BSD box and dual display on windows and want to use on my screen to view my BSD box
[04:20] <biovore> eob84: try ./ut-install-428.run should just work
[04:20] <sir_quicken> Hey they got an unbuntu package YAY!!
[04:20] <IdleOne> gopi: sudo apt-get -f install mythtv
[04:20] <sir_quicken> whoot whoot
=== drgreborn is now known as drg_eat
[04:21] <FlannelKing> mikebot: um, beyond the nvidia package? nope sorry.  Theres a helper config program too, I know that.
[04:21] <Crshman> bubba_: do i need to specifically enable it? i can see percentages, but not time
[04:21] <eob84> biovore, tells me command not found
[04:21] <sir_quicken> ok thx 4 help all l8tr
[04:21] <mikebot> FlannelKing: what about when i get the error that says: "Failed to start the X server (your graphical interface). It is likely it is not set up correctly. Would you like to view the X server output to diagnose the problem?"

[04:21] <biovore> eob84: chmod +x ut-install-428.run adn try again
[04:21] <nitrox> Flannelking: I was wondering if I should just VNC into the BSD box or use Cygwin and Putty on my Windows Box and export the display to windows
[04:21] <gopi> IdleOne: I tried it but still same problem...
[04:22] <bubba_> Crshman, I dont know what you specificly have to do. I didnt, I had to specificly disable acpi, then re-enable it after I figured out how to fix my problem.
[04:22] <biovore> eob84: or sh ./ut-install-428.run
[04:22] <Crshman> bubba_: ahh ok, i'll try it, thnx
[04:22] <eob84> biovore, I did that
[04:22] <aslkzxmn> hello all
[04:22] <FlannelKing> nitrox: using what?  X tunneling? or what?  That'll be cygwin with the program "xwin", if youre doing it locally (on a LAN) you can use XDCMP (or acronym like that) straight in cygwin, but if it's outside of a LAN, you'll have problems (and have to use putty and other methods) becaues xwin uses UDP
[04:22] <IdleOne> gopi: can you paste the erro in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ , thanks
[04:22] <eob84> biovore, now it does what it was doing initially
[04:22] <gopi> IdleOne: ok sure
[04:22] <eob84> biovore, Uncompressing Unreal Tournament version 428 Linux installtrap: usage: trap [-lp]  [arg signal_spec ...]
[04:22] <ttread> mikebot, what does the X server error say?
[04:22] <FlannelKing> nitrox: I use cygwin, it's pretty snappy.  Never tried the VNC method though.

[04:23] <ttread> mikebot, so you answer y does it say anything more?
[04:23] <eob84> mikebot, does it say anything about a unsuable display?

[04:23] <mikebot> i'm not sure
[04:23] <biovore> eob84: intressting
[04:23] <mikebot> it gave me that error and i opened the diagnose file

[04:24] <mikebot> and it was very long--too long to write down on paper then type again here
[04:24] <eob84> mikebot, if so I am guessing you are using the nvidia drivers?

[04:24] <ttread> mikebot, what is your nvidia card?
[04:24] <mikebot> it ended with "The X server is now disabled. Restart GDM when it is configured."
[04:24] <mikebot> geforce 4
[04:24] <eob84> mikebot, is your monitor a off brand thing?
[04:24] <mikebot> eob84: dell
[04:24] <wastrel> eob84:  trap appears to be a bash command - seems like there's an error in a trap call in your install script
[04:24] <nitrox> Flannelking: I am using it within a LAN and when I am outside the LAN I VPN in.... So I CYGWIN AND XDMCP would be better than CYGWIN and PUTTY for a LAN right?
=== whaq|off [i=whaq@203.130.197.106]  has joined #ubuntu
[04:25] <eob84> wastrel, damn really... can I update trap or something
[04:25] <linux_user400354> http://sial.org/pbot/16070 <-- i am getting this error from vncviewer on ubuntu. as soon as i connect to the vnc server, it starts to load and i can see some of it then i get disconnected.
[04:25] <pomalley> hm... another person with video card problems?
[04:25] <eob84> mikebot, check out the log file
[04:25] <ttread> mikebot, you can try looking in var/log/Xorg.0.log
[04:25] <FlannelKing> nitrox: yeah, since you're not worried about the ssh tunnel, which just gives the overhead of encrypt/decrypt (unless you don't trust your LAN for whatever reason)
[04:25] <mikebot> well here's the thing
[04:25] <wastrel> eob84:  what shell is the script using ( first line of the script should have #!/some/shell )
[04:25] <mikebot> i don't know how to read the log file, cause i don't know what i'm looking for

[04:25] <mikebot> and i only can use commands when i run ubuntu because the X server is down
[04:26] <IdleOne> gopi:  sudo apt-get install mythtv-frontend && mythtv-backend see if that helps
[04:26] <mikebot> so i have to go to the log
[04:26] <mikebot> write it on paper
[04:26] <mikebot> restart into windows
[04:26] <mikebot> and come back here
[04:26] <FlannelKing> nitrox: I juts xwin -query [linux ip]  in cygwin
[04:26] <biovore> eob84: trap is a built in command on bash to repond to hardware signals
[04:26] <eob84> mikebot, and see if it says stuff about hsync out of range

[04:27] <wastrel> biovore:  still if they're calling bash with /bin/sh  shouldn't it be backward-compatible?
[04:27] <nitrox> Flannelking: Do I still have to enable SSH forwarding?

[04:27] <ttread> mikebot, you can save yourself a little trouble by using knoppix
[04:27] <biovore> eob84: Quake3/Quake4/Doom/Doom3
[04:27] <mikebot> knoppix?
[04:27] <FlannelKing> nitrox: no, putty is completely removed from the picture.  Just the XDMCP and cygwin (then xwin, internally in cygwin)
[04:27] <biovore> nitrox: RTCF
[04:27] <eob84> biovore, wouldn't it be great if they had CS:S for it
