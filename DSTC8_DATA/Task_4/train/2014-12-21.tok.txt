<s> is it fine to skip the " select and install software " step of the ubuntu mini.iso expert installer when doing a minimal installation ? will it prevent the system from being installed correctly ? </s>
<s> ! minimal | <user> </s>
<s> <user> : the minimal cd image is very small in size , and it downloads most packages from the internet during installation , allowing you to select only those you want . the installer is text based ( rather than graphical as used on the desktop dvd ). see URL/https:/ URL/help.ubuntu.com/ URL/community/installation/minimalcd/ </s>
<s> ! ppapurge | <user> </s>

<s> yikes , i do n't want to purge my ppas ! </s>
<s> i just went into software center and clicked the videolan ppa off and updated . works fine now ... i just think i will forget to toggle it back on after a few days when it might be back online so i was asking how to temporarily exclude a ppa from an update . i do n't think pinning is what i want , so maybe i do n't understand how to use it . </s>
