[08:50] <bluefox83> nubs0r, when i started using debian, i had to use 4 floppies because i didn't have a dvdrw to create my own installer cd..i had to download the iso, extract the installer floppies, and use an empty partition on my drive to store the iso's so the installer would detect it

[09:09] <ubotu> I guess linux is the kernel (core) of the Ubuntu operating system. Ubuntu is only one version of the GNU/Linux operating system. For more information on Linux in general, visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux
[09:09] <boa-chan> anyone here use 2.6.0 of xchat ?
[09:09] <bluefox83> actually, linux can be pronouced any way you want, linux travoldi gave a conference once and they asked him about it, he said he doesn't care how it's pronounced so long as ppl can figure out wtf you're talkin about :P

[09:50] <bluefox83> csb, that's probably gnome-terminal then..i dunno why it's saying that though...
[09:50] <soundray> bluefox83, if you hold Ctrl and mark text in Konsole, all of it gets copied to the clipboard *except* the newline characters. It would be great if I could do that in gnome-terminal.
[09:50] <csb> and is there any reason to install gnomebaker if i have the built in ubuntu burner
[09:50] <Coburn> how i can save the config in icewm when i exit?????
[09:50] <topyli> csb: settings are all over the place. there's .nautilus, and many apps keep their settings in their own dot-files. just look at your home directory

[10:38] <soundray> bamboozle, my strategy here would be to find out what module Mandriva loads, then to see if that module is in the stock Ubuntu kernel.
[10:38] <sean_> is there a way to log into the gui as SU?
[10:38] <B_166-ER-X> i start ktorrent, and it doesnt show up, and if i try 'ktorrent' by terminal, it says 'ktorrent is already running'     can someone point me or .. ?
[10:38] <topyli> idiot: then you could mount the shares from fstab and treat them like any directory
[10:38] <lisette> su startx
[10:38] <blue-frog> idiot, xp home or pro?
[10:38] <DShepherd> mediafly: I rob you of the fun of you figuring it out all by yourself

[10:38] <helo212> is there an app on ubuntu that will allow me to burn an iso?
[10:38] <idiot> pro
[10:38] <mediafly> DShepherd, ;)
[10:38] <soundray> bamboozle, if yes, it's a matter of chanting the right incantation during the installer boot.
[10:39] <mediafly> DShepherd, what you expect? Give me the command parameters?
[10:39] <blue-frog> idiot, ok then u can access your windows by doing...
[10:39] <theCore> mediafly: boot with the LiveCD, then enter the command 'dd if=/dev/[xxx]  of=/dev/[yyy] '
[10:39] <sean_> I'm trying to make it so I can edit fstab, but as Linux is new to me (Primary Win2k user here) I can't seem to get it.... God, I feel dumb
[10:39] <blue-frog> idiot, in nautilus   smb://windows_IP/c$
[10:39] <sean_> :((
[10:39] <idiot> Yes I do not use Nautilus.
[10:39] <DShepherd> mediafly: dd=if<what do you inputing> of=<the file you want to save it to>.iso

[10:39] <daved-> is there any way to make vlc use gtk or something not quite as fugly as wxwindows?
[10:39] <Fujitsu> idiot: mount -t smbfs -o username=<username> //<server>/<share> /mnt/<mountpoint>
[10:40] <soundray> bamboozle, if not, try installing to any old IDE PATA disk, try if SATA works with the 2.6.15 kernel, and if it does, copy the installation with the working kernel over to the SATA drive.
[10:40] <B_166-ER-X> i start ktorrent, and it doesnt show up, and if i try 'ktorrent' by terminal, it says 'ktorrent is already running'     can someone point me or .. ?

[10:42] <blue-frog> idiot,  to mount    mount -t smbfs //IP/c$ /mnt/test -o username=login_Windows
[10:42] <ardchoille> I am damned impressed with Ubuntu 5.10. I have spent an entire 24 hours trying to break it and I can't. I did manage to mess up a package, but that was due to IUS and not Ubuntu;s fault.
[10:42] <ardchoille> Any Ubuntu devs here?
[10:42] <bamboozle> soundray: thanks. ill look into it. goodnight. :)
[10:42] <blue-frog> idiot, for that u need smbfs installed

[10:43] <soundray> DShepherd, to make sure that dd doesn't try to write needed data past the end of the target disk.
[10:43] <DShepherd> soundray: ok
[10:43] <topyli> ardchoille: they are "around" :) mostly on #ubuntu-devel though
