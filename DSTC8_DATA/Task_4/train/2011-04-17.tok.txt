<s> <user> : ive tried both of those . inside virtualbox , with 3d acceleration , they dont know what to do so they basically take a blank picture . </s>
<s> well i did that the first time around and i messed up my original partition with vista , so my question is when ubuntu asked me to split the partitions i just say yes ??? </s>

<s> <user> : mhm . i did scrot -d 10 -c <unka._> , and positioned the cube how i wanted it . </s>

<s> could not load back into vista ... :-( </s>
<s> <user> : how would i confirm that ? </s>

<s> <user> why do n't u run unity , and then take a screenshot via windows ... if that 's possible </s>

<s> <user> : yes . </s>
<s> <user> : alright , lets see here . </s>
<s> <user> : uh , he did n't say he 's running unity . just compiz . </s>
<s> if i drag and drop my home folder to a new install , will the hidden files be copied as well , or do i need to use cli for that ? </s>
<s> so should i just reboot like i did the first time with ubuntu and just make sure i seperate the partitions and will it give me a boot menu ? </s>
<s> <user> : but the point still stands ; it may be as much of a pain to do it that way what with it being somewhat accelerated ... possibly </s>
