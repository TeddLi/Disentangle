[13:55] <Pici> Lardarse: they are enabled by default.
[13:55] <acateoN> dystopianray: nice, ill give it a try... thanks again

[13:59] <nick4> When ever I go into pure console mode (CTRL+ALT+F1), the color of the directories is deep blue instead of light purple (and accordingly the color of the archives is deep red instead of light red). Is there a way to turn them to the color that the rest of Linux distros (Debian for example) have them? (meaning light pruple and light red)
[13:59] <Mountaingod> Ok, I've got one more issue with Gutsy to resolve before it 'just works', and then I can get onto customising. It won't shut down. Restarts fine, but pretty much as soon as I click 'shut down', the screen turns off and it locks up.
[13:59] <baggins> hi
[13:59] <MikeDX> nick4: you can set them in .bashrc i think
[13:59] <baggins> i've lost DRI on ubuntu 7.10 when i log in. it seems to spawn a new X server when i log in and can't get a lock on the hardware because the login screen still has it.
[13:59] <dystopianray> Mountaingod: do you have ati graphics?
[13:59] <baggins> i am logged in on the terminal with startx at the moment.
[13:59] <stefg> Mountaingod, that looks like an acpi quirk
[14:00] <MikeDX> Mountaingod: do you have the same problem if you run the "halt" command from a terminal?
[14:00] <baggins> it seems to spawn a new X when i log in on GDM or something, because the Xorg.0.log says it's all ok. anyone know how to stop it from doing this? it wasn't until i upgraded to 7.10
[14:00] <last-ottom4n> hi
[14:00] <Mountaingod> MikeDX: Just type 'halt'? I'll have a look
[14:00] <MikeDX> yeah as root
[14:00] <Mountaingod> dystopianray: No idea, where would I look?
[14:00] <MikeDX> or sudo halt
[14:01] <dystopianray> Mountaingod: lspci would tell you
[14:01] <MikeDX> Mountaingod: lspci | grep ATI or check the hardware menu
[14:01] <Mountaingod> stefg: whatever that is, how can I fix it? On the forums it appears to be a widespread issue
[14:01] <nick4> MikeDX I have done it before but reconfiguring a package, but I have forgoten it's name. However I like better the idea of tweaking .bashrc. Tell me some keywords for this operating to search them in Google.
[14:02] <stefg> Mountaingod, that depends on your hardware. you might need to add bootparameters or edit some configfile to use e.g. apm for powerdown
[14:02] <stefg> !boot
[14:02] <ubotu> Boot options: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions - To add/remove startup services, you can use the package 'bum', or update-rc.d - To add your own startup scripts, use /etc/rc.local - See also !grub and !dualboot - Making a boot floppy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto/BootFloppy - Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto

[14:03] <MikeDX> try that
[14:03] <MikeDX> might be .bash_profile actually
[14:03] <MikeDX> enjoy exploring :)
[14:04] <taggig> i got the it to work now using the restricted driver thingie
[14:04] <stefg> r_rehashed, it's a convention that all drives under /media get a desktop icon. you can either switch off desktop icons altogether, or mount the drives in /mnt , so these don't get icons anymore
[14:04] <stefg> !icons
[14:04] <ubotu> Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)

[14:15] <esjay> Question:  I just read the links posted by the bot on backing Ubuntu up, but still have a question...Is it possible to "ghost" a linux install...i have my system exactly how i want it now and would love to be able to store the image so i never have to configure things again
[14:15] <PriceChild> [Milos], sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[14:15] <fiXXXerMet> Why is it that ubuntu doesn't have a /etc/inittab file?
[14:15] <Pici> !upstart | fiXXXerMet
[14:15] <ubotu> fiXXXerMet: Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[14:15] <pazsion> so how do i use the nvidia-xconfig tool?
[14:15] <dystopianray> fiXXXerMet: it uses upstart
[14:15] <fiXXXerMet> Thank you both.

[14:15] <DRuNKeN-MAsTEr> Can any1 help me with VMware and Ubuntu install process? After installing and restarting Ubuntu in VMware Worstation it tells me " Cannot Find Operating System " , Any ideas any1 ?
[14:15] <stefg> DaanU, you locked yoursel out, if you managed to drop admin rights on the only sudo-user (admin-member). you have to boot to recovery (will give you a root prompt) and procced from there
[14:16] <dystopianray> minimec: look within that directory

[14:17] <mudfly> DRuNKeN-MAsTEr, have you tried to contact VMware for support on workstation?
[14:17] <esjay> anyone on that ghosting question?
[14:17] <minimec> dystopianray: I t's a link. If I want to open it, it gives me an error

[14:17] <dystopianray> minimec: it is strange that you do not get the partition step, i am not sure how to solve that one
[14:17] <DRuNKeN-MAsTEr> mudfly, no
[14:18] <DaanU> Alright, thanks a lot stefg! Never thought of that, this will do the trick. Thanks again1
[14:18] <Zasch> Hello. I recently attempted to restore Ubuntu from a backup (There was some article on the Ubuntu wiki about backing up to TAR)...however, when I did this, it no longer boots. It tells me that some "root=UUID=<a bunch of numbers>" doesn't exist. What's wrong and how do I fix it?
[14:18] <DRuNKeN-MAsTEr> i am following their install guide and no luck so far
[14:18] <mudfly> DRuNKeN-MAsTEr, since that is a commercial product you should try their support.
[14:18] <minimec> dystopianray: It's the first time I have this problem... I am very surprised too...
[14:18] <ifree2> stefg: how do I perform a fresh reinstall CORRECTLY? due to experience, whenever i do reinstallation, all the mounting screwed up
[14:18] <Chamunks> genii, ok so i suppose a "sudo aptitude remove picard" would be in order before i try all this?
[14:18] <dystopianray> minimec: try the alternate installer
[14:19] <genii> Chamunks: If you used the package manager to install it, i'd say yeah
[14:19] <Downix> Can Ubuntu handle clustering?
[14:19] <minimec> dystopianray: How would I launch that one on the console?
[14:19] <stefg> ifree2, first get a backup of your existing installation, so you have all config files backed up as well
[14:19] <ifree2> yes, thanks. What should i do after that?
[14:19] <Zasch> Does anyone know how I can find the "real" (I guess) root=UUID= or whatever it is asking for?
[14:19] <jrib> !uuid > Zasch (read the private message from ubotu)
[14:20] <Chamunks> genii, thats what i did but unfortunately it doesent want to scan my media library container folder recursively so it kindof defeats the purpose of a mass tagger
[14:20] <pike_> Zasch: gksu gedit /etc/fstab  just remove the uid and replace with /dev/hda1 or whatever you see when sudo fdisk -l
[14:20] <DRuNKeN-MAsTEr> Downix read the docs on the server edition. It might have it. Not sure about the desktop verision
[14:20] <livingdaylight> Downix, you're making cluster bombs?
[14:20] <DRuNKeN-MAsTEr> *Laughs*
[14:20] <stefg> ifree2, and once you are reinstalling anyway, i would suggest to do some smarter partition layout, i.e. having /home and /boot on separte partitions
[14:20] <pazsion> do i need to give it a bus ID?
[14:20] <Downix> *laughs*
[14:20] <Downix> figuring out the best way to handle a server
[14:20] <ifree2> stefg: i have /home, but not /boot
[14:20] <dystopianray> minimec: you need to download the alternate installer iso
[14:20] <Anthology> did 7.10 come out of beta today?
[14:20] <Downix> I might just do LVM with an NFS system for the userdata and database
[14:20] <dgjones> Anthology, 18th October
[14:20] <jrib> Anthology: the 18th it did
[14:20] <dystopianray> Anthology: last week
[14:21] <Anthology> ah thanks
[14:21] <auowE> Abiword is making really big pdf files.  How can I tell it to make small pdfs?
[14:21] <Anthology> :P
[14:21] <pazsion> i hope it didn't leave beta.. still has issues
[14:21] <christoffer> When I try to launch steam with Wine I get a Permission denied error when it tries to load a file, can anyone help?
[14:21] <stefg> ifree2, that's fine. having /boot seperate has more benefit for heavy tinkerers like me
[14:21] <Anthology> pazsion, i thought it still had a few issues to be worked out too
[14:21] <pike_> auowE: dunno make ps instead and distill em? not sure
[14:21] <minimec> dystopianray: Well I will try to reboot that thing ;) THX for your help.
[14:21] <jrib> pazsion: paste the actual error on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and provide the channel with a link
[14:21] <stefg> ifree2, so you just tell the installer what your /home partition is (make sure to **not** format it).
[14:22] <auowE> can't I set the parameters with any configuration files?
[14:22] <Chamunks> genii, any particular reason why gutsy should be more similar to lenny than feisty?
[14:22] <pazsion> how do i install nvidia using nvidia-xconfig file?
[14:22] <pazsion> well right now, sound doesn't work after latest updates
[14:22] <pike_> pazsion: use the restricted manager
[14:22] <stefg> ifree2, but do a backup nevertheless. gutsy might be a nasty surprise for you, depending on your hardware
[14:22] <jrib> !nvidia > pazsion (read the private message from ubotu)
[14:22] <genii> Chamunks: Mostly kernel changes
[14:23] <pike_> auowE: sorry not that familiar with abi
[14:23] <ben--> heya
[14:23] <pazsion> restricted manager doesn't detet it and lst time i used restricted drivers x didn't want to load anymore
[14:23] <ifree2> stefg: thank you. Is that all? But then i cannot do any partition resize else the mounting messed up again
[14:23] <ben--> I've just used the Ubuntu 7 ISO to burn an installation CD...
[14:23] <pazsion> been there ubotu
[14:23] <ben--> I boot using that CD, the Ubuntu menu with a lot of options pops up
[14:23] <pazsion> faqs are no help at all
[14:23] <taggig> any1 know a good "dockapp" for 7.10?
[14:23] <tdeverell> Sorry...  I got an IM but lost it.
[14:23] <ben--> I've tried running the "Install Ubuntu" option
[14:24] <ben--> it says I/O Error
[14:24] <ben--> and reboots.
[14:24] <pike_> pazsion: do a google search for nvidia latest gutsy or somesuch id write or print th esteps out before proceeding with manual install if its your first time
[14:24] <tofukitty> grr, all these questions of installing ubuntu without a liveCD or USB boot capability, why oh why did nobody say Wibu? lol ^^
[14:24] <auowE> ok, is there any other word processory which is lightweight and having all the capabilities of abiword (not openoffice)
[14:24] <Chamunks> genii, ok thats what i assumed
[14:24] <christoffer> When I run steam with Ubuntu / Wine no text on the buttons or anything will show.
[14:24] <jrib> pazsion: your question is answered there.  Did you actually read the page?
[14:24] <christoffer> It's asif I have to install a font it needs
[14:24] <pazsion> even documentation that came with the linux nvidia drivers leave me hanging with exactly what to do.. yes this is pretty much my first go at this
[14:24] <ben--> tokukitty: cause wubi does not partition
[14:24] <ben--> which sucks.
[14:24] <tofukitty> !wibu
[14:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wibu - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi

[14:25] <taggig> ty GuTi-zz

[14:25] <surface> anyone install ubuntu-restrict-extras got problem of msttcorefonts ?
[14:25] <jrib> pazsion: you were linked directly to your answer
=== mars_ is now known as RobNyc
[14:25] <stefg> ifree2, you don't need to do any partition resizing. Choose 'manual' in the partitioning dialog, tell the insaller which partition to use for your / and format that (your current feisty partition), tell it waht to use as /home (NOT checking the format box) and the installer will automagically mount it right, and your files and settings are still there
[14:25] <pike_> pazsion: http://albertomilone.com/latest_nvidia_udsf_feisty.html#METHOD_2  but this is using nvidia installer and not packages youll need to rerun this when you do kernel upgrades
[14:25] <iGotRice> mv
[14:26] <slylock_> hmmm
[14:26] <iGotRice> mv file /home or something
[14:26] <slylock_> guys i asked this before
[14:26] <surface> anyone install ubuntu-restrict-extras got problem of msttcorefonts ? getting this line "Error parsing proxy URL http://:8080/: Invalid host name."
[14:26] <slylock_> but dont quite understand
[14:26] <tuntun> On the ubuntu alternate cd there is installation mode called "OEM Mode". What does it do?
[14:26] <jrib> iGotRice: mv file directory
[14:26] <slylock_> i am doing ssh to a remote machien to run an app
[14:26] <iGotRice> y cant we just drag it
[14:26] <az> hello, i am on macbook, dont feel like installing any hacks to make my right mouse working. is there any other way to add new icon on desktop and make it excuting script ?
[14:26] <pazsion> jrib that didn't work... and is pretty lacking in what needs to be done.. pikes... thank you
[14:26] <ben--> may I ask what's the diffrance between Ubuntu CD and Ubuntu LiveCD?
[14:26] <slylock_> when i kill terminal the app is killed
[14:26] <slylock_> someone here told me to use screen
[14:27] <ben--> is LiveCD like Knoppix? no installation, just runs off the CD?
[14:27] <stefg> ifree2, but i repeat: DO A BACKUP before upgrade. an upgrade is a one way ticket, and you might find you want to go back to feisty
[14:27] <iGotRice> isnt it the same
[14:27] <iGotRice> im using livecd
[14:27] <slylock_> is there anyother way to go about it
[14:27] <tuntun> ben--:yes
[14:27] <Spooons> Help!  BulletproofX in Gutsy refuses to give me resolutions over 800x600,and if I look in the xorg log it says it's because the virtual sceen size is set to 800x600.  Yet it's set to 1792x1344 in my xorg.conf
[14:27] <scguy318> ben--: yes
[14:27] <AyueLee> :)
[14:27] <iGotRice> took me hella long time to figure out the nvidia issue
[14:27] <jrib> pazsion: you asked how to use nvidia-xconfig and that page tells you, I'm not sure what else you want
[14:27] <ben--> umm ok, now another question

[14:29] <iGotRice> sometimes this new laptops
[14:29] <genii> Chamunks: I was thinking along the same lines. the documentation on their site sems a bit sparse
[14:29] <ben--> maybe my burner is screwed
[14:29] <scguy318> ben--: the MD5 of your ISO?
[14:29] <iGotRice> with widescreen
[14:29] <ben--> just wanted to know if there's another reason besides that...
[14:29] <iGotRice> all u need to do is change the vga format
[14:29] <ben--> checked the MD5 sums
[14:29] <thingummywut> any ideas why my screen appears all black during boot messages, and then xorg.conf is rewritten to only contain 640x480 resolution?

[14:29] <dgjones> ben, what speed are you burning at? its mostly recommended to burn at a slower speed to avoid problems with the cd
[14:29] <ben--> yea, Wubi
[14:29] <ben--> which doesn't partition
[14:29] <scguy318> ben--: theres more to it than Wubi
[14:29] <ben--> and the other one, which does partition but does not support vista
[14:30] <esjay> Question:  I just read the links posted by the bot on backing Ubuntu up, but still have a question...Is it possible to "ghost" a linux install...i have my system exactly how i want it now and would love to be able to store the image so i never have to configure things again
[14:30] <ben--> I don't want to manually touch the Vista boot loader...
[14:30] <Chamunks> genii, yeah i kinda wish i could find their irc room kus maybe then i could ask their devs or somethin
[14:30] <ben--> I just don't trust my computer skills are sufficent...
[14:30] <scguy318> ben--: what speed were you burning at?
[14:30] <taggig> GuTi-zz: how do i install it?
[14:30] <PriceChild> Chamunks, devs don't do support.
[14:30] <ben--> tried max at first, then changed to 10x, which should work
[14:30] <ben--> my cd is able to read it, I think
[14:30] <iGotRice> the cdlive
[14:30] <iGotRice> u dont install it
[14:30] <ben--> 10x is the lowest possible on this burner anyways...
[14:30] <johnn1> who in their right mind would use vista anyway...no pun intended.
[14:31] <LjL> esandeen: it's possible with "dd", type "man dd", but i couldn't give you exact instructions

[14:31] <iGotRice> woot
[14:31] <johnn1> run over it with ubuntu..and be happy.
[14:32] <PriceChild> tuntun, for people who build machines... it means they can install ubuntu, make modifications, then easily make it so the next time someone boots it, they get a wizard to create users etc.
[14:32] <ben--> scguy318: is there some sort of installation method which would let me keep my Vista and install Ubuntu without me having to manually touch the boot loader?
[14:32] <genii> Chamunks: np

[14:32] <scguy318> ben--: the installer does your boot loader for you

[14:37] <underwater> server nana.irc.gr
[14:38] <LjL> Shapeshifter: i don't think that's reasonably possible to do. the text cursor position is determined by the program that is using the terminal (ncurses, mostly, or it just won't matter)... think about the way 'vi' uses it. how could someone ever write a program that correctly simulates cursor key movement using the mouse, with such diversity of behaviors?

[14:44] <Mountaingod> Gutsy clean install will not shut down. It shuts down fine with 'sudo halt'. It has been suggested that X is the problem. I don't even really know what X is. Can anybody help me?
[14:45] <lumien> i know that there is a terminal services client in ubuntu 7.10 and it works great, but is there a way to "offer remote assistance" to a windows machine with ubuntu so that I can see the users screen while they are logged in? I do not want to use vnc.
[14:45] <zombie_monkey> I have two ubuntu PCs and a crossover cable, and I know how to make a local network using that. but how to copy files from one to the other?

[14:45] <navesrevart> hey...
[14:45] <navesrevart> my ubuntu won't boot
[14:45] <navesrevart> is teh such
[14:45] <nefoia> roar: such triviliaities should be treated in the 7.10 release
[14:45] <navesrevart> suck
[14:45] <genii> lumien: Maybe rdc
[14:46] <tech0007> zombie_monkey:   use nfs
[14:46] <lumien> genii: thanks for the clue. i will check it out
[14:46] <navesrevart> I updated and installed the nvidia-glx-new
[14:46] <raar> nefoia: ah cool, thanks
[14:46] <navesrevart> rebooted
[14:46] <navesrevart> and now nothing works
[14:46] <pike_> raar: a google search like:  site:ubuntuforums.org "/bin/sh: can't access tty"   shows a few threads about this in forums
[14:46] <johnn1> try re-installing it...i had to.
[14:46] <nefoia> navesrevart: then stop whining..
[14:46] <LjL> !ttyerror
[14:46] <ubotu> If you get an error on boot similar to <unconvertable> /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off <unconvertable> , you can try the fixes proposed at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TTYError
[14:46] <zombie_monkey> tech0007: I remember there was some simpler way involving the command line wherein I log in the other PC... nc or something?
[14:47] <tech0007> zombie_monkey: ssh?
[14:47] <fairway_> hi all, is xubuntu the fatest distro?
[14:47] <LapatiK> Ubuntu is the best thing i've ever seen....[this is a non commercial useless advertising]  I begin to like gnome
[14:47] <fairway_> fastest
[14:47] <martian> fairway_: fastest ubuntu distro?
[14:47] <tech0007> fairway_: the lightest to say the least, in terms of ram usage
[14:47] <zombie_monkey> it was a command to copy some stuff and it just propted me to provide a user name and password on the otehr pc
[14:47] <fairway_> macd: yes
[14:47] <Alan_> So, here's the question - does anybody know how to fix the Xorg resolution DPI bug on gutsy?
[14:47] <fairway_> i would also like to know how to change grub's default OS
[14:47] <johnn1> I threw my windows cd's away..my hd thanks me.
[14:47] <tech0007> zombie_monkey: oh its rcp
[14:47] <webreg> Hi everyone
[14:47] <fairway_> martian: yes
[14:47] <LjL> fairway_: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[14:48] <webreg> can i ask something
[14:48] <LjL> !ask
[14:48] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[14:48] <webreg> ehehe
[14:48] <webreg> lol
[14:48] <fairway_> LjL: I cant sudo
[14:48] <webreg> can i install the Macroemedia software in Ubuntu?
[14:48] <LjL> fairway_: why?
[14:48] <fairway_> LjL: does unbuntu come with a default pw admin?
[14:48] <johnn1> adobe flash
[14:48] <webreg> yeah
[14:48] <nefoia> macd: the web dev?
[14:48] <LjL> !root > fairway_    (fairway_, see the private message from Ubotu) no, you use sudo with your *own* password
[14:48] <martian> fairway_: then yeah... there are probably 'faster' linux distro's, but to get the awesomeness of ubuntu, that's probably the lightest... to change your default OS, edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst
[14:48] <johnn1> with Gnash..works well
[14:48] <fairway_> LjL: afai the installer did not ask for an admin pw
[14:49] <Mountaingod> Gutsy clean install will not shut down. It shuts down fine with 'sudo halt'. It has been suggested that X is the problem. I don't even really know what X is. Can anybody help me?
[14:49] <webreg> can work in ubuntu the adobe dreamwaver? and flash?
[14:49] <LjL> fairway_, it's the password that you type for your *own user*
[14:49] <zombie_monkey> tech0007: yes, I just found it myself, it's rcp, thanks :)
[14:49] <tech0007> zombie_monkey: welcome
[14:49] <LjL> webreg: dreamwaver, maybe under WINE, i don't know. flash, yes
[14:49] <LjL> !flash > webreg    (webreg, see the private message from Ubotu)
[14:49] <noelferreira> my keyboard layout changes to default (US) everytime i reboot. How can i have it starting in (pt)?

[14:49] <webreg> thanks
[14:50] <robertfisk> anyone using putty on their xchat here ? Im not able to connect to my localhost ... Is there any difference from windows except the port is / instead of : ?
[14:50] <martian> fairway_: but be careful, you can break things if you're not careful... you'll want to change the number next to 'default' to be the OS you want to start
[14:50] <nefoia> robertfisk: putty and xchat?
[14:50] <robertfisk> yes
[14:50] <robertfisk> Im running putty thru a bnc
[14:51] <nefoia> robertfisk: through*, and.. ?
[14:51] <martian> robertfisk: but putty is an ssh client, and xchat is a gui app...
[14:51] <noelferreira> my keyboard layout changes to default (US) everytime i reboot. How can i have it starting in (pt)?
=== wakko__ is now known as bushwakko
[14:51] <nefoia> robertfisk: there really is no relationship between putty and xchat
[14:51] <nefoia> please understand your question.
[14:52] <LjL> robertfisk, i can understand using Putty (or any SSH client) to log into, say, an irssi session. but what does it have to do with xchat?
[14:52] <robertfisk> if you dont know what i mean , then I guess you cant help me :) its the way to run bnc on irc
[14:52] <LjL> robertfisk: not really, i'm on a bouncer and not using putty.
[14:52] <Mountaingod> Gutsy clean install will not shut down. It shuts down fine with 'sudo halt'. It has been suggested that X is the problem. I don't even really know what X is. Can anybody help me?
[14:52] <LjL> or xchat
=== pbn_ is now known as pbn
[14:53] <robertfisk> my bouncer goes thru putty , but xchat doesnt want to connect to my localhost somehow . Ill ask the guy who gave me the bnc
[14:53] <nefoia> it apperas that gutsy was released eariler than it should've been..
[14:53] <martian> Mountaingod: does it freeze before showing the shutdown options?
[14:53] <Mountaingod> No, I click the top-right button, it comes up with all the options (hibernate, etc.), I click shut down, screen goes blank, and that's it. It restarts fine
[14:53] <vonderer> hallo there!
[14:54] <LjL> robertfisk: is the bouncer running on your *own* machine? (if not, then why would you connect to localhost? is it a reverse SSH tunnel?)
[14:54] <godzirra> Anyone have any issues with Gutsy since release?  After a few hours of working, my wireless network stops working and can't reconnect, I can't run anything with sudo, and opening a terminal window won't work.  It worked fine in Feisty, and jnc was positive that its my network, but i can't find anything wrong with it.  I've added a root user so I could see if I could log in to see whether it was a pam issue, and had no trouble logging
[14:54] <robertfisk> yes , its a tunnel
[14:54] <godzirra> I have no more ideas as to what to test or what is causing the problem.
[14:54] <zombie_monkey> godzirra: the only problem I've had is the Fn combos on my laptop keyboard stoped working except for num lock.
[14:54] <vonderer> got a problem: each time I reboot my computer I get fglrx.ko removed from /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/volatile
[14:54] <simplyubuntu> hey can anyone give me some tips on how NOT to screw up my gutsy install (again)?
[14:54] <LjL> robertfisk: does doing <unconvertable> telnet localhost portnumber <unconvertable> give you a connection refused?
[14:54] <robertfisk> yes
[14:55] <martian> simplyubuntu: don't do anything stupid :)
[14:55] <Mountaingod> martian:No, I click the top-right button, it comes up with all the options (hibernate, etc.), I click shut down, screen goes blank, and that's it. It restarts fine (if I select restart
[14:55] <vonderer> so the module does not load and I have to make a new copy or link from ../misc/fglrx.ko
[14:55] <godzirra> zombie_monkey: Yeah, mine just stpos working.  I can't use sudo, and I can't reconnect to my network, or open another terminal window in X;.
[14:55] <LjL> robertfisk: then your reverse SSH tunnel simply isn't *up*, it's not x-chat's fault
[14:55] <Lion31> how can I install the ntfs-config package... I have searcged for it in the synaptic package manager and havent found a thing
[14:55] <simplyubuntu> martian i tried that with feisty lol
[14:55] <robertfisk> ok . ill do some more checking . im new on ubuntu :)  thanks
[14:56] <johnn1> U may want to check the burn..try burning gutsy @ a slower speed to ensure validity.
[14:56] <auowE> I want to boost my system performance what are the services that I can disable? I turned of dbus and got into trouble, little help is needed.
[14:56] <Lion31> I need access to my ntfs and fat32 partitions
[14:56] <zombie_monkey> i guess it doesn't make much sense to upgrade early if you're not prepared to fix any problem that may come up
[14:56] <simplyubuntu> but the story is that i installed gutsy once perfectly (after a failed upgrade with the alternate cd) and screwed that up too...
[14:56] <jrib> !ntfs > Lion31 (read the private message from ubotu)
[14:56] <tech0007> Lion31: make sure your repos are complete
[14:56] <johnn1> loo
[14:56] <martian> simplyubuntu: try harder ;) ... no, really... here's a good idea. Next time you decide to reinstall the OS, make a separate partition that mounts to /home and that way IF you DO screw things up, your personal settings and files will not be gone
[14:56] <fairway_> what media player comes close to foobar2000 ?
[14:56] <vonderer> got a problem: each time I reboot my computer I get fglrx.ko removed from /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/volatile, so the module does not load and I have to make a new copy or link from ../misc/fglrx.ko
[14:56] <jamesfoster> Does fullscreen mode in OpenOffice.org Calc work for anyone in Gutsy? (window appears behind panels for me, just wondering whether the behaviour is specific to accelerated xorg or my hardware)
[14:57] <tuntun> simplyubuntu: how did you screw it up?
[14:57] <simplyubuntu> i know (that measure was already taken ;)... luckily)
[14:57] <jrib> jamesfoster: works here (just plain metacity)
[14:57] <tuntun> anyone had a netsplit lately?
[14:58] <simplyubuntu> tuntun what i did was that i copied my package selections list from feisty to gutsy... following !cloning on this channel
[14:58] <martian> fairway_: I've heard people really like 'listen', but amarok and others are similar I think
[14:58] <Lion31> hm... this pidgin is ok, couse I can do a lot of things... but this irc client ... lets  just say I have to get used to it :)
[14:58] <TheGateKeeper> has linux got anything like ghost that would let ghost a hdd, partitions and all?
[14:58] <zombie_monkey> fairway_: hah, i'm wondering about that myself and I hear this questiona ll the time... I just installed Quod Libet which is supposedly somewhat close
[14:58] <jrib> TheGateKeeper: partimage comes to mind
[14:58] <vonderer> got a problem: each time I reboot my computer I get fglrx.ko removed from /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/volatile, so the module does not load and I have to make a new copy or link from ../misc/fglrx.ko
[14:58] <jrib> TheGateKeeper: or dd I guess
[14:58] <tuntun> simplyubuntu: why not do a clean install?
[14:58] <simplyubuntu> but before i updated it and installed all my old pkgs, i copied all the debs from the old /var/cache/apt/archives to the new one...
[14:59] <fairway_> yes i know
[14:59] <TheGateKeeper> jrib: ok thanks, I have heard of both of them
[14:59] <fairway_> though mythbuntu looks interesting for a MCE
[14:59] <kkathman> whats the gnome config tool called ?
[14:59] <simplyubuntu> because its a pain for me to download all the packages again... which i would have had to do ANYWAY since im installing a new release
[14:59] <jrib> kkathman: config for what?
[14:59] <bmt2> hello to all
[14:59] <tuntun> kkatham:"gconf-editor"
[15:00] <simplyubuntu> lol apparently that didnt get through me thick head...
[15:00] <TheGateKeeper> jrib: I guess you need partimage on a live cd
[15:00] <kkathman> jrib - general gnome settings - i.e. icon padding, etc
[15:00] <tuntun> kkathman:"gconf-editor"
[15:00] <bmt2> how can i find out where my cdrom is located.....because i do not see it at /dev/cdrom or /dev/cdrom0
[15:00] <TheGateKeeper> jrib: anyway thanks :)
[15:00] <auowE> ok, I've another small doubt.  in the system monitor when I summed up all the processes memory it is nearly 40MB, but in resources it showing 200MB as used memory.  how can I recover the RAM?
[15:00] <kkathman> but isnt there a gnome-config  something also?
[15:00] <simplyubuntu> bmt2 are you trying to cd to those directories>
[15:00] <bmt2> simplyubuntu: yes
[15:01] <jrib> kkathman: gnome-control-center?
[15:01] <dcnstrct> I just did a fresh install of gutsy gibbon, installed rails, mongrel, mysql-server, and
[15:01] <dcnstrct> mysql-client.  I installed the msyql gem.  For some reason whenever I type rake db:migrate
[15:01] <dcnstrct> (or any other rails command that would use the db) I get this msg: Client does not support
[15:01] <kkathman> jrib ahh that might be it
[15:01] <dcnstrct> authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client  :  what causes this ? thnx
[15:02] <jrib> dcnstrct: try to keep what you say on a single line, or else the channel becomes too busy
[15:02] <vonderer> got a problem: each time I reboot my computer I get fglrx.ko removed from /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/volatile, so the module does not load and I have to make a new copy or link from ../misc/fglrx.ko
[15:02] <simplyubuntu> bmt2 thats not what youre supposed to do that... those are symbolic links to those devices (hence /dev) and they must be mounted to another directory before you can cd to them
[15:02] <DanielC> Will Gusty Gibbon run slower than Dapper Drake on a 2.6 Ghz computer with 1.4 Gb RAM?
[15:02] <simplyubuntu> try cd'ing to /cdrom

[15:02] <bmt2> simplyubuntu: ok
[15:02] <noelferreira> my keyboard layout changes to default (US) everytime i reboot. How can i have it starting in (pt)?
[15:02] <lumien> Its beginning to look like there isn't a "remote assistance" utility in linux to access a windows box
[15:02] <taggig> how do i remove the /media disks from my desktop
[15:02] <tuntun> DanielC: No, it more efficient actually.
[15:02] <tech0007> Do i need to install samba and smbfs if i want to access windows shares?
[15:03] <DanielC> tuntun: Great. Thanks.
[15:03] <simplyubuntu> tuntun now im on my third try... crossed fingers and all.. i usually learm my lesson by the third failiure :P
[15:03] <bmt2> simplyubuntu: i am getting nothing
[15:03] <fairway_> under ubuntu i would like to have a fullscreen application for playing music (flacs, mp3s) videos (avis) etc. for a media center pc
[15:03] <fairway_> what app is the way to go?
[15:03] <jrib> lumien: don't know much about it but is applications -> internet -> terminal server client not what you want?
[15:03] <godzirra> Anyone have any issues with Gutsy like this?  After a few hours of working, my wireless network stops working and can't reconnect, I can't run anything with sudo, and opening a terminal window in X won't work.  I had no issues with Feisty, and jnc was positive that its my network, but i can't find anything wrong with it.  I've added a root user so I could see if I could log in to see whether it was a pam issue, and had no trouble logg
[15:03] <DanielC> tuntun: Why is it faster? Gnome improvements?

[15:05] <simplyubuntu> i am... for the second time lol
[15:05] <bmt2> simplyubuntu: tell me that ' mount point /foo/moo does not exist'
[15:05] <fly> ubuntu
[15:05] <tuntun> simplyubuntu: so what goes wrong them?
[15:06] <Alp`> did anybody compare thunderbird and evolution? i wonder which one is better
[15:06] <simplyubuntu> you need to enter a valid dir instead of foo/moo... those are just variables
[15:06] <Lion31> jrib: I am not trying to guess the pass I already know it! I just want to acess the roo.. so I can enter my pass
[15:06] <PecisDarbs> what  is package name for that niffy Xorg configuration tool? displayconfig-gtk?
[15:06] <tech0007> Do i need to install samba and smbfs if i want to access windows shares?
[15:06] <jrib> Lion31: did you read the page that ubotu linked you to?  it tells you how
[15:06] <martian> Lion31: then do: su -
[15:06] <bmt2> simplyubuntu: so if i make a dir called 'test' at /...then i could mount /dev/cdrom to that (/test) ?

[15:09] <arcticblue> I turned on my PS3 today and to my surprise, my MythTV box showed up on it.  Well, recorded TV and stuff works, but I live in Japan so everything recorded is saved with a Japanese filename.  This causes the UPnP server some confusion and it sends garbled text to my PS3.  Anyway to get the UPnP server to send the Japanese characters?  (configuring utf-8 support maybe?)

[15:13] <Mountaingod> Please folks, every time I can't properly shut ubuntu down I can practically smell my hard drive getting a little more damaged. Why is it that so many people on the forum have such a fundamental problem but there are barely any posts suggesting fixes? I just want to be able to turn my computer off without 'sudo halt' or just cutting the power.
[15:13] <Pici> simplyubuntu: gives you an interactive sudo session, like you logged in as root in any other distro.
[15:13] <simplyubuntu> ah
[15:13] <tuntun> noelferreira: so is your problem solved?
[15:13] <xsacha> im running gutsy and would like all the packages required to build packages. is there a meta package for this? stuff like dpkg-dev and debhelper
[15:13] <martian> Lion31: this is all described in the page that Pici linked you to. It's nice if people read what they are linked when they have questions, because it saves others many keystrokes

[15:14] <arcticblue> I turned on my PS3 today and to my surprise, my MythTV box showed up on it.  Well, recorded TV and stuff works, but I live in Japan so everything recorded is saved with a Japanese filename.  This causes the UPnP server some confusion and it sends garbled text to my PS3.  Anyway to get the UPnP server to send the Japanese characters?  (configuring utf-8 support maybe?)
[15:14] <Alp`> Mountaingod: i dont know the problem, but do you have a clean install or an upgrade?
[15:14] <bulmer> simplyubuntu-> you can login as root, only once you establish a password for root..
[15:14] <noelferreira> ok
[15:15] <simplyubuntu> but is that possible on ubuntu?
[15:15] <jean-claude> jaurais besoin aide svp cest nouveau pour moi
[15:15] <bulmer> yes
[15:15] <Vlet> simplyubuntu: security. If YOU can't login as root, then no one else can too. Also, by having to type sudo in front of a command, it helps you to think twice about what you're doing.

[15:45] <bmt2> ampex: no
[15:45] <ampex> Intangir: what type of nvidia card do you have?
[15:45] <Vlet> Seems to me that if you can't figure out how to su into root, you shouldn't :)
[15:45] <Gentleman> Ok awesome ! I got the driver enabled need restart. :)
[15:46] <KNY> n4p1, sounds like you're missing some Java libs (what jre version?)
[15:46] <Pici> Diafic: I might be remembering this wrong, but I think that you need gnome-compiz-dectorator, it provides compiz-dectorator.
[15:46] <Gentleman> Thank you.

[15:48] <DShepherd> paulcooperorama, sudo -i
[15:48] <bmt2> ampex: it is telling that block device /dev/cdrom is write protected, mounting read-only and that i must specify the filesystem type
[15:48] <ampex> how does running "sudo -" differ from "sudo -i"
[15:48] <ampex> ?

[15:48] <taggig> Vlet, ely?
[15:48] <taggig> rly*
[15:48] <KNY> DeFirence, basically have a script check if `ps -A | grep daemonName` is null and, if so, restart the daemon

[15:50] <simplyubuntu> ampex i already told bmt2 that

[15:51] <pazsion> ok, nvida card must work, i have settings in apps/system tool  for nvidia now
[15:51] <bmt2> ampex: mount: block device /dev/cdrom is write-protected, mounting read-only
[15:51] <bmt2> mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/cdrom, missing codepage or other error In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try dmesg | tail  or so
[15:51] <pack> I boot root off raid1. Update to gutsy hangs waiting for raid. Older installed kernel finds raid correctly. update-initramfs -k all -v -c broke all my kernels (they all hang looking for raid now).  I booted off a live cd and compiled a vanilla kernel with my raid/sata drivers built in and it boots correctly. Should I be putting in a bug report for something like this? Or is root on raid an unsupported config?
[15:52] <ampex> bmt2:  are you sure the disc is working elsewhere?
[15:52] <bmt2> ampex: all i know is when i put a CD in the drive....my laptop sees it because it puts a icon on my desktop
[15:52] <keitherz> when i installed my ubuntu the GRUB installation didn't detected my windows partition
[15:53] <ampex> bmt2: but the icon doesn't work?
[15:53] <lardarse> how do you take a screenshot that includes the mouse pointer?
[15:53] <bmt2> ampex: icon works
[15:53] <ampex> bmt2: then what's your problem?
[15:54] <bmt2> i can cd to the CD to see the contents
[15:54] <keitherz> how to unmount with sudo

[15:54] <ampex> bmt2: so you can access the contents of the CD through the icon on your desktop, but not from the command line?

[15:55] <bmt2> ampex: correct
[15:55] <quittt> hello
[15:55] <taggig> can i reinstall uzureus using a sudo command?
[15:55] <ampex> bmt2: if it's accessible on the desktop it has to be mounted
[15:55] <taggig> azureus*
[15:55] <quittt> I downloaded the text basic CD
[15:55] <gypsymauro> sometimes it happens that friends takes off usb-pen without unmounting them so the next time they try to mount it it fails and they dunno why, the question is..if they reboot the pc letting the pen inside, the cfdisk will check the fat/vfat fs automatically?
[15:55] <Le-Chuck_ITA> Hi all
[15:55] <ampex> bmt2: can you privmsg me the output of running "mount" with no parameters?
[15:55] <quittt> without the live cd... but I'm having problems with it

[15:56] <Le-Chuck_ITA> problems with undefined symbols and dpkg --configure -a quitting
[15:56] <quittt> what is that?
[15:56] <Le-Chuck_ITA> I don't seem to be able to recover my system
[15:56] <Le-Chuck_ITA> dpkg --configure -a says there are too many unconfigured packages
[15:57] <Le-Chuck_ITA> and quits for that reason
[15:57] <ampex> Le-Chuck_ITA: I've heard of update issues, and that people have had better luck with fresh installs
[15:57] <Le-Chuck_ITA> I know but I didn't expect such a great breakage
[15:57] <Vlet> Le-Chuck_ITA: oh, updated... yeah, there have been a lot of problems with the upgrade. You might be better off just backing up and reinstalling

[16:16] <gaw> After updating to gutsy my dns some times resolves addresses to (1.0.0.0) any ideas?
[16:16] <dotjay> i get this massage when i try to install a vm in v box i need to add new user http://img230.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot1pa1.png
[16:16] <Le-Chuck_ITA> DShepherd: this makes me feel better too since the upgrade path is not that broken but
[16:16] <stefg> boris__, http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html
[16:17] <Le-Chuck_ITA> ALL developers here should think about checking /usr/local/lib before upgrading, and warning users
[16:17] <Le-Chuck_ITA> it's so easy
[16:17] <CapaH> Is there a way that whenever I restart my computer, I can have ALL of my applications appear, exactly as I have them, in exactly the same windows and workspaces as I have them?
[16:17] <Le-Chuck_ITA> if there are libs in /usr/local/lib, tell the user and eventually rename /usr/local to something else during upgrade
[16:17] <Vlet> dotjay: yeah, I saw the message. It looks to me like (the commands you posted above) you're creating a new group called vboxdrv. Why? The message is telling you to add yourself to the group called 'vboxusers' and then log out/in
[16:17] <DShepherd> Le-Chuck_ITA, well maybe the should. maybe not. I think its more about packaging though.
[16:17] <Pici> CapaH: I believe there is a setting in gnome session to save your session when you logout/exit

[16:19] <ubotu> fairway: ntfs is To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions .  For NTFS write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse
[16:19] <kousotu> how would I go about doing that?
[16:19] <fevel> hey guys, i have a little problem...when I installed gutsy, I had an sd card plugged in. Now its on my fstab and I cant unmount it...can someone please help me fix this issue?

[16:19] <fairway> !fuse
[16:19] <ubotu> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is a !kernel driver that allows non-root users to create their own filesystems. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace for more on FUSE.  Some examples of filesystems that use FUSE are !ntfs-3g, sshfs and isofs. A full list of Filesystems that use FUSE is here:  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems
[16:20] <Pici> jacquesmerde: Just doing a few things at the same time :)

[16:21] <paulcooperorama> how can I get this channel  on a windows machine
[16:21] <brianves> I'm sorry for interrupting any conversations and also at such a long post,  but here goesWell I looked all over the place and it seems I have a unique issue. I just got an ultra generic mp3 player (small for jogging) coby MP-C893 2G flash. No screen.
[16:21] <brianves> I'm trying organize my files on the player in a very specific way. so I started numbering them in the order I wanted. It took alot of messing around to get even remotely close to playing the order that was displayed on my computer. I even did away with #s to see if alphabetical would work. that was worse.
[16:21] <brianves> OK my problem... My mp3s are separated by about 15 folders... all the folders play backwards i.e. largest number to smallest. About 3 of the folders' files play forward. I renamed all the backwards playing files... well backwards in hope that they would then play forward. well guess what they still play backwards.
[16:21] <rob_> even though i put my proxy in through System -> Network -> Proxy
[16:21] <brianves> What am I doing wrong? Is it the player? Is it something about Ubuntu organization vs. NTFS? I'm absolutely losing my mind, please help
