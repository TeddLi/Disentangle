[00:07] <v1ru5> now i booted, no errors
[00:07] <v1ru5> BUT
[00:07] <skyhawker> HappyFool, oh crap. that's how simple it is???
[00:07] <Seveas> xophEr, run hdparm as root
[00:07] <v1ru5> how do i launch up x and some WM manually????
[00:08] <v1ru5> startx doesn't work.
[00:08] <thoreauputic> xophEr: sudo
[00:08] <xophEr> yes, I did run it as root
[00:08] <Seveas> v1ru5, is startx won't work, it does not work :)
[00:08] <holycow> startx from where?

[00:08] <xophEr> oh
[00:08] <Chalma|ZzZ> well I'm about dead I will try tomorrow
[00:08] <v1ru5> i am really getting tired of this ubuntu shit
[00:08] <Chalma|ZzZ> gnight

[00:09] <v1ru5> Seveas: yep
[00:09] <HappyFool> skyhawker: maybe someone else knows about '32-bit chrooting', or something, which may help you; unfortunately I'm not familiar with that
[00:09] <v1ru5> and now i am thinking of the 16th
[00:09] <Seveas> v1ru5, that does not install X :)
[00:09] <thoreauputic> xophEr: yes, the space was wrong I think - sorry
[00:09] <v1ru5> Seveas: oh, lol
[00:09] <xophEr> thoreauputic, still didnt work :)
[00:09] <xophEr> same error
[00:09] <v1ru5> so another install
[00:09] <v1ru5> lol
[00:09] <v1ru5> brb
[00:09] <thoreauputic> xophEr: hmm
[00:09] <Seveas> v1ru5, no
[00:09] <v1ru5> O_o
[00:09] <holycow> v1ru5, well lets see, you are trying to install dual boot but you don't have the skills to pull it off ... :)
=== spiral [~spiral@84.4.161.184]  has joined #ubuntu
[00:09] <Seveas> v1ru5, which window manager do you want? gnome/kde/xfce?
[00:09] <holycow> v1ru5, try getting a separate hd and install it on that
[00:09] <skyhawker> HappyFool, hm ok. damn......um, is there another program I can use....or should I take the time to format and install the 32-bit version..
[00:09] <v1ru5> Seveas: gnome
[00:09] <holycow> that way you can boot into what you need and you get to still play with ubuntu
[00:10] <skyhawker> HappyFool, could I install 32-bit?
[00:10] <Seveas> v1ru5, in the console, simply type: sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
[00:10] <v1ru5> holycow: actually, i've only had problems with the boot loader, not the os's itself
[00:10] <HappyFool> skyhawker: as far as i know, you can install 32-bit x86 ubuntu on an amd64
[00:10] <skyhawker> HappyFool, would this be my best option?
[00:10] <thoreauputic> xophEr: are you sure the drive is hda ?
[00:10] <Seveas> v1ru5, then wait a while and reboot
[00:10] <HappyFool> skyhawker: i don't know; have you googled on 'amd64 wine' ?
[00:10] <holycow> v1ru5, *nod*, just for the record, i understand your frustration, i'm just trying to linup the cause and effect properly
[00:11] <xophEr> thoreauputic, positive..

[00:12] <thoreauputic> *status
[00:12] <srivest> xophEr: it's possible that the controller doesn't let you do that dynamically .. on the web they talk abour recompiling the kernel with DMA "on"
[00:12] <v1ru5> holycow: yep well, for some reason the MBR is busted
[00:12] <v1ru5> and i don't know how to fix MBR's
[00:12] <HappyFool> skyhawker: i'm not sure what this means, but it doesn't sound promising re wine on amd64 (in 64-bit mode): http://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64/2005/02/msg00341.html

[00:12] <holycow> do i what? dual boot?
[00:12] <v1ru5> Seveas: ok, but what's the password? O_o
[00:12] <v1ru5> Seveas: for the sudo
[00:12] <HappyFool> skyhawker: so i guess your best bet is 32-bit mode if you really need wine
[00:12] <Seveas> v1ru5, your own
[00:12] <holycow> no, dual booting is stupid considering how cheap hd's are
[00:12] <v1ru5> holycow: can you fix broken sectors on HD's
[00:12] <holycow> i use removable hd trays and usb hd's
[00:12] <Seveas> the one you log in with
[00:12] <Bola> v1ru5: haha what a nick :)
[00:13] <skyhawker> HappyFool, yeah I just googled it, there's a lot of questions, but no answers

[00:13] <srivest> xophEr: I've just tried myself and I get: HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Invalid argument
[00:13] <HappyFool> skyhawker: what do you need wine for?
[00:13] <holycow> ah no, i never learned about mbr because there is no point :/
[00:13] <v1ru5> Seveas: "user xxxxxxxx" is not on sudo list ..
[00:13] <holycow> wish i could be more helpfull

[00:13] <holycow> used what for 10 years?
[00:14] <v1ru5> this nick
[00:14] <skyhawker> HappyFool, I'm still trying to get my head around Linux really, but there's a few little games and programs I'd still like to be able to use..
[00:14] <holycow> oh, haha!
[00:14] <v1ru5> O_o
[00:14] <holycow> sorry thought you were talking about linux, nm
[00:14] <v1ru5> :D
[00:14] <v1ru5> i wish
[00:14] <v1ru5> anyhow, how do i add people to sudo list?
[00:14] <HappyFool> skyhawker: well, despite the opinion of others here ;) i'd considering have a dual-boot system
[00:14] <HappyFool> v1ru5: do you have a root password? did you enter one during install?
[00:14] <v1ru5> cause when i give sudo my pass it just says that my login is not in the sudo list
[00:14] <v1ru5> yeah i have it
[00:14] <v1ru5> but sudo apparently doesn't want it
[00:15] <HappyFool> v1ru5: then use 'su -c <command>' instead
[00:15] <v1ru5> just says that wrong password byebye
[00:15] <HappyFool> v1ru5: entering the root password
[00:15] <srivest> anyone using skype ?
[00:15] <v1ru5> can't i just change to root and run aptitude without the sudo
[00:15] <v1ru5> ?
[00:15] <thoreauputic> v1ru5: because sudo wants your user passwd
[00:15] <HappyFool> v1ru5: you can add yourself to the sudo list by doing something like 'EDITOR=gedit su -c visudo /etc/sudoers'
[00:15] <rem_> Hey just a simple question how do you open a tgz.gpg file ?
[00:15] <skyhawker> HappyFool, ha I've had that before and don't particularly like that method, I did have Fedora Core 4 installed on a VMWare virtual drive when I was on XP, but I'm trying to stay away from the windows installation
[00:16] <holycow> http://www.newsforge.com/articles/05/07/19/1824234.shtml?tid=149  <-- heh, love that article
[00:16] <HappyFool> skyhawker: i didn't mean vmware, but actual dual-booting. anyway, if you're happy with 32-bit linux, go for it. i'd first check that whether your apps work with wine or not

[00:17] <HappyFool> v1ru5: yeah, you can do 'su -c aptitude' to, but ubuntu gnome admin apps (and most people here) will assume you have sudo setup

[00:18] <v1ru5> i changed to root, ran the aptitude..
[00:18] <medrakil> is there any way to find out what's keeping my cdrom from ejecting?
[00:18] <Samuar> google for an old trial of vmware on someones anon ftp and you will find one. i sent an email to vmware noticing one once, and they just told me it was perfectly legal - even tho the keygen was sitting next to it. so with their blessing, i used it...

[00:19] <thoreauputic> medrakil: try sudo eject /dev/cdrom
[00:19] <HappyFool> medrakil: maybe 'lsof /dev/cdrom' ?

[00:25] <sylvan> Hi all. How come I can only read my mounted windows partition using "sudo".. It says that the owner is "root" and chmod'ing it doesn't work...
[00:25] <darkmatter> HappyFool: same here
[00:26] <HappyFool> i'm not complaining ;) this is just the way linux (or ubuntu) currently works
[00:26] <medrakil> sylvan: specify another owner in fstab
[00:26] <medrakil> sylvan: can't remeber how you do that thoufg
[00:26] <sylvan> how? /dev/sdb5	/mnt/winxp_scratch	ntfs	rw,auto,user 0 0
[00:26] <medrakil> *though
[00:26] <HappyFool> sylvan: add a umask=000 option
[00:26] <sylvan> ok, will try
[00:26] <HappyFool> sylvan: so 'rw,auto,umask=000'
[00:26] <Seveas> HappyFool, ro
[00:27] <darkmatter> I'm not complaining either. Maybe I'm just weird, but I actually like it that way:D
[00:27] <HappyFool> on ntfs?
[00:27] <Seveas> ntfs writing is not possible :)
[00:27] <HappyFool> is ro anyway *shrug*
[00:27] <HappyFool> oh
[00:27] <HappyFool> right, sorry
[00:27] <Seveas> yeah :)
[00:27] <HappyFool> more thinking, less typing
[00:27] <Seveas> no matter what you do, write bits won't be set :)
[00:27] <sylvan> what does "user 0 0" do?
[00:28] <HappyFool> i think 'user' means any normal user can mount the device
[00:28] <nikkia> sylvan: user says anyone can mount/unmount it, and the 0 0 are the fsck sequencing, since ntfs isn't fsck'ed, its 0 0
[00:28] <sylvan> hmm..  well that's strange since that's precisely what doesn't happen =) I can not reach it as "sylvan" but I can reach if I sudo
[00:28] <Seveas> sylvan, it talks about *mounting* not about reading from it...
[00:28] <HappyFool> sylvan: but it's mounted for you on boot, by root
[00:29] <Seveas> auto,ro,umask=0000 will make it readable by anyone
[00:29] <sylvan> ah.. so umask=000 sets read permissions?

[00:29] <sylvan> one more question, uid=1000 and gid=1000 appears on another mounted disk, what does that mean?
[00:29] <thoreauputic> FWIW
[00:30] <sylvan> 022?
[00:30] <Seveas> sylvan, that means that uid 1000 will be listed as owner
[00:30] <sylvan> meanin?
[00:30] <thoreauputic> sylvan: because it's read-only
[00:30] <Seveas> and 022 is effectively the same as 000 on ntfs
[00:30] <sylvan> ok
[00:30] <HappyFool> uid 1000 (user id 1000) is probably you

[00:40] <pvanhoof> bob2, what has to be done to get it working (in case I'm highly experienced)
[00:40] <Seveas> bob2, k, thanks anyway :)
=== nnach1 [~shaohui@shaohui.kawo2.RWTH-Aachen.DE]  has left #ubuntu []
[00:40] <iZoom> hallo
[00:40] <bob2> pvanhoof: reading the various bug reports and ubuntu-devel archives
[00:41] <nikkia> vladuz976: for example, say i use ftp to create a symlink from ~/public_html/passwd to /etc/shadow   normally, while that would 'work', i wouldn't be able to read the file, but if i then use cpanel to access the filesystem, i could potentially view /etc/shadow
[00:41] <vladuz976> nikkia: probably big hassle to change everything since, it's set up already for a while
[00:41] <bob2> clearly you're not, tho, so it's kinda moot
[00:41] <iZoom> warum geht mein modem nicht mit ubunto?
[00:41] <Seveas> iZoom, #ubuntu-de fuer deutschsprachige hilfe..
[00:41] <pvanhoof> bob2, clearly I've probably been developing/contributing on most of the applications that you're working with atm.
[00:41] <pvanhoof> however, whether or not I'm experienced doesn't really matter
[00:41] <pvanhoof> right?
[00:42] <pvanhoof> which bugs are the most important ones?
[00:42] <bob2> I'm not trying to be an ass, sorry
=== iZoom [nobody@p54B3401B.dip.t-dialin.net]  has left #ubuntu ["Client]
[00:42] <bob2> but breezy is really quite fucked
[00:42] <nikkia> vladuz976: worse, because apache/cpanel is running as root, i could perhaps even overwrite /etc/shadow with my own contents, and thus gain complete access to the system :)
[00:42] <bob2> daniel basically told everyone to leave him alone until next week when he can fix it
[00:42] <Seveas> without X, breezy is reasonably fine :)
[00:42] <Seveas> nikkia, apache running as root..?
[00:42] <bob2> pvanhoof: I don't know the specific bug #s, sorry
[00:42] <Seveas> that's stupid...
[00:43] <pvanhoof> ok np
[00:43] <nikkia> Seveas: that's what vladuz976 said it is configured as
[00:43] <vladuz976> nikkia: that doesn't sound very good
[00:43] <pvanhoof> I'll mainly search for bugs related to X
[00:43] <cyphase> anyone having problems with DNS?
[00:43] <vladuz976> Seveas: yes
[00:43] <Seveas> apache running as root is a major security error
[00:43] <nikkia> Seveas: i can't remember if apache chroot's tho, i don't think it does...
[00:43] <Seveas> cyphase, only in firfox :)
[00:43] <bob2> apche doesn't chroot
[00:43] <cyphase> yea..
[00:44] <Seveas> cyphase: Open firefox and go to about:config. Now search for network.dns.disableIPV6 and set that value to true. Restart Firefox to see the effect.
[00:44] <cyphase> it's not just firefox
[00:44] <cyphase> wget isn't working either
[00:44] <nikkia> bob, didn't think so, it'd make handling ~/public_html very difficult unless you start a new thread/process for each URL and chroot after determining where to chroot to
[00:44] <Seveas> cyphase, disable ipv6 completely then, that might help
[00:45] <bob2> pvanhoof: #ubuntu-devel might be a better place to ask, but I don't htink anyone in the know is around atm
[00:45] <cyphase> Seveas, it was working a minute ago..
[00:45] <bob2> nikkia: hah, yeah
[00:45] <pvanhoof> ok
[00:45] <Seveas> cyphase, ah ok
[00:45] <Seveas> then your dns server may simply be b0rking a bit
[00:46] <thoreauputic> cyphase: maybe look for a public dns server and change /etc/resolv.conf ?
[00:46] <Seveas> cyphase, try: dig @82.148.208.131 freenode.net
=== _Tsukasa is now known as Tsukasa
[00:47] <Seveas> cyphase, if that works, your normal dns server is having a hickup
[00:47] <nikkia> thoreauputic: i've found that on some ISPs, you're simply better setting up a caching DNS locally that goes straight to the root servers

[00:50] <cyphase> ah

[00:50] <darkmatter> vladuz976: Debian
[00:50] <Seveas> and I still use red hat/solaris/windows at work
[00:50] <cyphase> for the network
[00:50] <thoreauputic> vladuz976: Ubuntu is less hassle ;)
[00:50] <pvanhoof> in what package can mkfontdir be found (on breezy?)
[00:50] <vladuz976> Seveas: where do you work, that they give you all that
[00:50] <bob2> I still use both
[00:51] <bob2> pvanhoof: it may not be in any package yet

[00:51] <nikkia> thoreauputic: the mcc is the real veteran one :P
[00:51] <Seveas> vladuz976, but I try to stay clear of all these OS'es and am installing Ubuntu wherever I can :)
[00:51] <thoreauputic> nikkia: :)
[00:51] <vladuz976> thoreauputic: yeah, see i am thinking since ubuntu is less hassle that will keep me from learning some basic stuff

[00:52] <thoreauputic> vladuz976: not really - Ubuntu is mostly like Debian

[01:05] <vladuz976> thoreauputic: shoot something wrong then here
[01:05] <pvanhoof> I do agree there' s some package issues. mkfontdir isn' t in a package
[01:05] <thoreauputic> vladuz976: nah, he's away now
[01:05] <pvanhoof> going to reboot to test the new kernel (in a few minutes, first making sure everything is set correctly)
[01:05] <Seveas> vladuz976, a control panel should not be integrated into apache but be its own web server...
[01:06] <vladuz976> Seveas: so as long as not integrated into apache its ok?
[01:06] <darkmatter> pvanhoof, how'd you fix X? II've been having a heck of a time getting it going in breezy.
[01:07] <Seveas> vladuz976, well, I still don't like these kind off applications, they are major security risks....
[01:07] <Seveas> server admins should be able to edit config files :)
[01:07] <pvanhoof> darkmatter, you basically need to get a mkfontdir binary installed (in your PATH and in /usr/X11/bin also -- symlink it --), and then dkpg-reconfigure xfonts-base
=== pho [~pho@H2db8.h.pppool.de]  has joined #ubuntu
[01:07] <darkmatter> pvanhoof, thanks:)
[01:07] <vladuz976> Seveas: yeah they probably should, but this guy knows less than me about linux and is runnning fedora on his server
[01:08] <thoreauputic> vladuz976: just /msg ed you the output
[01:08] <pvanhoof> darkmatter, it basically fails to install mkfontdir .. and some scripts/etcetera's still have it pointed to /usr/X11/..
[01:08] <Seveas> darkmatter, pvanhoof that just fixes it until daniels breaks something else :)
[01:08] <pho> it still hasnt the permissions to write, the line looks like that:
[01:08] <pho> /dev/hda8       /media/windows_i vfat auto,umask=0111,dmask=0222,fmask=0333 0 0
[01:08] <pvanhoof> Seveas, yep :). So I'm going to be careful when upgrading
[01:08] <vladuz976> thoreauputic: got it thanks
[01:08] <darkmatter> pvanhoof, lol
[01:08] <Seveas> pho, remove the umask bit, and the dmask bit is faulty
[01:09] <Seveas> pho, for an easy solution: remove it completely and download and run http://ubuntu-nl.org/files/winmac-fstab

[01:28] <Seveas> zukalk, what happens is that you send an X message to XMMS which is handled by its main loop. This has no equivalent in a simple shell command because that would simply be impossible

[01:41] <banskuz> Windblows have one good feature: 1) You can unistall it!
[01:41] <sataere> Because I had some problems when I was running Gentoo, everything would get unbearably slow while it was writing to the hdd, but when I configured it for SATA, it worked perfectly.  I'm having some really bad slowing down now that I'm updating my packages, and it reminds me of the same problem.
[01:41] <zukalk> lordfreak, i don't like the Skype's version for Linux
[01:41] <thoreauputic> zwnj: well, "make" is GNU make (I assume that's gmake) See apt-cache show make
[01:42] <lordfreak> No much
[01:42] <zukalk> banskuz, never knew that :P

[01:42] <Seveas> and then retry configure
[01:43] <zwnj> thoreauputic: i symlinked gmake to make, but it's not good that GNU Make package doesn't have gmake which many applications' build system depends on
[01:43] <Jugan> i installed a new version of OpenOffice, and I wanted to delete the old one which was installed with ubuntu...how do i do this?
[01:43] <lordfreak> Zukalk do you know why my fonts in Linux Version of Skype are so Huge ?
[01:44] <zukalk> lordfreak, Skype uses QT, maybe that's what causing it
[01:44] <sataere> Eesh, I used to be able to get answers within seconds on this channel, now it's like I'm invisible.  :(
[01:44] <zukalk> lordfreak, try the command 'qtconfig'
[01:44] <lordfreak> zukalk .... Hummmm 1 second Im trying
[01:44] <Seveas> zukalk, lordfreak, that is in the qt3-qtconfig package (FYI)
[01:45] <thoreauputic> zwnj: anyone writing for linux who doesn't know that "make" is gmake is ... *cough* in some alternative universe, IMO
[01:45] <zukalk> ah, thanks for clearing that up, Seveas, i couldn't remember where i got it
[01:45] <zwnj> mozilla people doesn't write just for linux
[01:45] <lordfreak> zukalk .... qtconfig doesn't runs nothing
[01:46] <zwnj> btw, gmake is available in many systems
[01:46] <zwnj> so mozilla needs gmake, not linux
[01:46] <sataere> Does anyone know if I could add SATA support to my hot plugs?
[01:47] <lordfreak> seveas thanks
[01:47] <zukalk> Seveas, should he install qt3-qtconfig?
[01:47] <thoreauputic> zwnj: I think you missed my point - why would you assume gmake is available in linux, when commonly it is invoked with "make" and is *the same thing* ?
[01:47] <Seveas> zukalk, well, to run qtconfig that would be neccessary
[01:47] <snowman1000> could anyone tell me how to run fdisk?
[01:48] <Seveas> snowman1000, run it in a terminal
[01:48] <Seveas> snowman1000, what are you trying to accomplish?
[01:48] <zukalk> Seveas, no, but what he needs is too make the fonts smaller. is there another way of doing so?

[01:52] <sataere> Seveas, Okay that gives me back a listing of eight pretty mundane looking variables.  Nothing to do with SATA or IDE.
[01:52] <thoreauputic> zwnj: yes, i think they should send a bug report upstream - any linux user knows "make"- but gmake is kind of obscure if you aren't on unix

[02:11] <sataere> Seveas, as far as I know the instructions are to download the million and three codecs before you compile mplayer, so it can link to them.
[02:11] <Seveas> Jugan, or the w32codecs package from the backports repo
[02:11] <skyhawker> thoreauputic, ok I got ...I feel really stupid now :)
[02:11] <Seveas> sataere, that is not trye

[02:12] <v1ru5> bob2: bliss?
[02:12] <sataere> bob2, There have been viruses for linux, they just can't do much with the security as it is.
[02:12] <bob2> v1ru5: url to media coverage of it affecting users?
[02:12] <skyhawker> and when I run this file, will these mounts be availavble on startup?
[02:12] <sataere> Seveas, I may be mistaken.
[02:12] <bob2> sataere: I know how viruses and linux work
[02:12] <v1ru5> hey, can i give someone a remote access to my box so they could fix it?

[02:13] <bob2> giving strangers root access on your machine is highly highly silly
[02:13] <Hajuu> Hey uhm.. I've been trying to follow the ubuntu wiki guide for fixing an ubuntu install after you've installed windows. Anyone familiar with this?
[02:13] <v1ru5> coz your crap ubuntu won't work

[02:14] <bob2> v1ru5: please stop being silly
[02:14] <Seveas> v1ru5, that's because you made an error. The thing that happened to you is not Ubuntus fault...
[02:14] <leroj> how would i remove kubuntu?
[02:14] <Seveas> leroj, what do you wnat instead?
[02:14] <v1ru5> bob2: sorry, but i am really, really really, REALLY FUCKING PISSED here.

[02:14] <qt2> amd the new sun stuff \o/ ;)
[02:14] <leroj> i installed kubuntu on top of ubuntu
[02:14] <bob2> v1ru5: go and have a cup of tea or go for a walk or something
[02:14] <Seveas> v1ru5, go and be frustrated somewhere else, this is a help channel and we don't need the noise
[02:14] <qt2> ande ven the new k3b \o/
[02:14] <qt2> busy day, eh ;)
[02:14] <v1ru5> Seveas: all i did was installed it and started my machine. now where did i make the error? on the machine starting part?
[02:15] <leroj> i don't want it anymore
[02:15] <Seveas> leroj, use debfoster to prune kubuntu-desktop
[02:15] <bob2> Hajuu: best to just ask about the bit you're having trouble with
[02:15] <thenuke> and bliss is from -97 :) I bet that it havent affected anyone in past 5 years
[02:15] <Seveas> v1ru5, no during install you must have done something funky...
[02:15] <v1ru5> i would just want my linux to work, but the install doesn't work properly, at least on this machine.
[02:15] <v1ru5> Seveas: no i didn't.
[02:15] <sataere> Seveas, http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML-single/en/MPlayer.html#id2823089 please note under win32, "put the codecs in /usr/local/lib/codecs  BEFORE compiling MPlayer, otherwise no Win32 support will be compiled"
[02:15] <v1ru5> and that's what's so bitchy about it
[02:15] <leroj> debfoster?
[02:15] <v1ru5> coz i knew i didn't do anything wrong
[02:16] <Seveas> v1ru5, then your error report is bullshit, you should have said that during install funky things happened...
[02:16] <v1ru5> and it doesn't work
[02:16] <bob2> you "knew"? how?
[02:16] <ubuntudigger> i have finaly found a correct driver for my printer, downloaded to my desktop, but when i try to install my new driver in printer driver , it says: can only install ppd files an my driver is not an ppd
[02:16] <bob2> 9/10 times install problems are bad cds
[02:16] <thenuke> whoa :D bliss had commandline option --bliss-uninfect-files-please  which worked :D
[02:16] <Seveas> leroj, it's a program you run from the terminal. read its manpage for more info (package debfoster)
[02:16] <v1ru5> because you can't do much errors in the default install .. or at least i didn't
[02:16] <bob2> v1ru5: have you verified the cd yet?
[02:16] <thoreauputic> sataere: but there's no need for that since mplayer is available in the multiverse repo and w32codecs from hoary extras

[02:17] <v1ru5> yeah well, i tried to verify it, but ubuntu doesn't detect the cd's @ cdrom
[02:17] <v1ru5> :/
[02:17] <Seveas> you can verify it under windows...
[02:17] <v1ru5> can i do it from windoz?
[02:17] <v1ru5> how?
[02:17] <Seveas> verify the iso before burnign it and the cd after burning it
[02:18] <Seveas> v1ru5, download the MD5SUMS from releases.ubuntu.com/hoary/ and use an md5sum checker
[02:18] <Seveas> (search download.com for one)
[02:18] <sataere> thoreauputic, perhaps, but last time I installed it (admittedly a long time ago) it refused to work.  And the point is, the codecs are necessary before compiling to work, contrary to Seveas
[02:18] <Hajuu> bob2: Well the problem is that when I try to reinstall grub as my boot manager by running grub and typing "root (hd0,2)" then it says something about how it cannot mount the filesystem or something.. And im not sure why. Running grub-install /dev/hda results in more or less the same result.
[02:18] <ubuntudigger> the drivers named: brscan-0.0.12-0.i386.deb,

[02:19] <lsuactiafner> just compile the mplayer cvs like i'm doing atm..

[02:21] <Seveas> Whistler, unix is an OS created by AT&T and a registered trademark. Linux is a kernel created by Linus Torvalds that aims to be compatible with Unix
[02:21] <bob2> ubuntudigger: it's fairly unlikely that you need this

[02:22] <hondje> I'm still confused on that...cups and sane are drivers, usbstore is a module, right?
[02:22] <lsuactiafner> windows created a broken tcp/ip stack also to be more 'secure' tho bsd and linux implements it and they are secure.
[02:22] <ubuntudigger> yes, i am sure cant find the proper driver in the system
[02:22] <bob2> usbstore is a kernel module, I'd guess
[02:22] <exhu> lsuactiafner, thanks.
[02:22] <bob2> which is in some sense a driver
[02:22] <Seveas> sataere, so funny: why does the ubuntu package works *perfectly* without having ubuntu codecs anywhere near while being compiled....
[02:23] <bob2> printers don't need to be handles by the kernel, though
[02:23] <skyhawker> why don't most things add themselves to the menus when they are installed...

[02:39] <lsuactiafner> and DO NOT run fsck on your own
[02:39] <hondje> bob2: I know about (and have used) acls, but it seems to me that there 'should' be some sort of medium
[02:39] <bob2> chrissturm: most FS programmers I know use vim or emacs
[02:39] <lsuactiafner> or you kill your disk easily..

[02:39] <MonsieurBon> hello
[02:39] <nikkia> Seveas: TOG made it so that anyone can apply to call their system 'UNIX'
[02:39] <Seveas> and there is the 'Singel Unix Specification' that is sort of an extended posix
[02:40] <bob2> and SUS is freely avilable, unlike POSIX
[02:40] <nikkia> Seveas: basically, you need to adhere to to the specifications for the UNX95/2000 whatever specs
[02:40] <sexcopter8000m> hi, i'm in windows at the mo. i had an empty ntfs partition, have deleted it and want to make it fat so i can share files between ubuntu and windows, but when i go through the format process, ntfs is the only option. can anyone help?
[02:40] <Seveas> nikkia, ah, url to more info please :)
=== ztonzy [~ztonzy@ztonzy.artist.blender]  has joined #ubuntu
[02:40] <bob2> sexcopter8000m: you might be better off just formatting it from ubuntu then
[02:40] <nikkia> seveas, its on TOG's website somewhere, i forget the URL
[02:40] <chrissturm> bob2: i was thinking more in the direction of something like kdevelop
[02:40] <nikkia> seveas, there was talk about IBM paying for linux to be UNIX2000 certified
[02:40] <sorush20> guys a number of times I have had to reinstall Ubuntu due to an error that occurs and an scan process starts but terminates and is unable to fix anything... It searches for nodes and it returns that it can not be read and do you want to force overwrite... this goes on for ever... does any one have any suggestions if this happens again...
[02:40] <bob2> chrissturm: there's monodevelop, but it's only for C#
[02:40] <bob2> eclipse is apparently nice for Java

[02:41] <sexcopter8000m> ok, if i boot into ubuntu now, i'll brb and then someone can kindly point me in the right direction :)
[02:41] <lsuactiafner> sorush20 : runs ext3
[02:41] <lsuactiafner> not ext2
[02:41] <Seveas> hondje, and that's exactly what happend: kiddies writing KDE crap
[02:41] <Seveas> :0
[02:41] <Seveas> ;)
[02:41] <bob2> sorush20: why are you having so much disk corruption?
[02:41] <MonsieurBon> I want to do the following: There are 1295 files in a directory, I'd like to download with wget. Can I use a for-thing to do that? or do I have to download all the files manually? the files are named 1.txt to 1295.txt
[02:41] <lsuactiafner> and learn fsck -a -y /dev/bleh next time youhave an ext2 error
[02:41] <nikkia> seveas, when IBM has finally killed AIX, they will probably want to be able to claim their linux systems as 'UNIX[tm] ' so it would make sense for them to do it
[02:41] <lsuactiafner> MonsieurBon : i'll paste you a line to do that
[02:42] <sorush20> bob2 I don't have any when windows is running...
[02:42] <hondje> Seveas: that's a good thing in my book
[02:42] <oliwer> monsieurBon ?
[02:42] <hondje> more crap the merrier, people like crap :)
[02:42] <bob2> sorush20: are you just turning your computer off without shutting down or something?
=== Psystorm [~psystorm@p54966258.dip.t-dialin.net]  has left #ubuntu ["Verlassend"]
[02:43] <hondje> once you get a kid writing nonsense like I do with qtdeveloper, they're more likely to stick around making linux apps, that can only be good
[02:43] <nikkia> Seveas: http://www.theopengroup.org/certification/unix-home.html
[02:43] <sorush20> no.. its been left on and after a few hours it  seems to happen... and I don't know what has happend... or anything..
[02:43] <sorush20> bob2,
[02:43] <nikkia> seveas, basically, you pays yer money, you makes yer OS adhere to the 'single unix specification' and you get to call it UNIX :)
[02:44] <sorush20> does any one here have an antivirus running...
[02:44] <Seveas> nikkia, I see
[02:44] <bob2> you don't need antivirus software on ubuntu
[02:44] <leroj> woo
[02:44] <nikkia> seveas, interestingly, i note there is a 'UNIX03' now
[02:44] <sorush20> okay... how about firewall..
[02:44] <thoreauputic> nikkia: I expect IBM will wait until the lawyers have wiped the floor with SCO ;)
[02:44] <bob2> sorush20: so, what exactly is happening to your system?
[02:44] <bob2> sorush20: it just randomly crashes?
[02:44] <nikkia> thoreauputic: probably
[02:44] <oliwer> guarddog is a nice firewall

[02:46] <sorush20> bob2, yes.. it seems to randomly crash and all I see is the boot loader failing... it seems to be scanning the disk... then it fails and asks me to scan manually with the command fsck, I do this and it finds unreadable nodes and just keeps on prompting me to force overwrite..
[02:46] <hondje> shows how much I pay attention :)

[02:47] <bob2> that's screwed up, you need to fix that first
[02:48] <sexcopter8000m> well, it was a logical drive on an extended partition, so i wondered if that restricted it to ntfs, so i deleted it and it made no difference

[02:48] <sexcopter8000m> oh =(

[02:49] <sexcopter8000m> windows says you can have up to 4
[02:49] <bob2> that's fine
[02:49] <bob2> Nard: what do you want to do in it?
[02:49] <sexcopter8000m> ok, back soon! :)
[02:49] <Seveas> Nard, by installing samba...
[02:50] <Nard> bob2, i want to transfer files from one to another

[02:50] <Nard> is there a better way then what i was thinking

[03:24] <Crembo> hey all! I've just downloaded and burned the Ubuntu combo installer+live+large fries DVD. after booting with it, how do I select which route to take? (currently, I'm a windows user with zero linux knowledge).
[03:25] <TD> Seveas: where?
[03:25] <Seveas> Crembo, when you boot from it, you select install-or-live

[03:25] <pcharky> Crembo: which route?
[03:25] <sexcopter8000m> i've only changed the ntfs to vfat in the line - now reads "/dev/sda2       /media/D        vfat    umask=0222      0       0". Ok?
[03:25] <Crembo> Live CD.

[03:26] <Crembo> I've been searching around the forums and documentation to figure out the exact series of steps I need to take in order to dual-boot with my XP. unfortunately, all I've come across so far was jumbled, not quite clear and/or conflicting.

[03:26] <bob2> Crembo: install ubuntu.  enjoy automatically setup dual-boot-ability.
[03:26] <pcharky> Crembo: Do you mean how you can boot the livecd?

[03:28] <TD> Seveas: they seem incomplete. i can't find libgtkmm-2.4-dev on there
[03:28] <TD> http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/libg/
[03:28] <TD> in fact even libgtk is missing
[03:28] <Crembo> the thing that made me uneasy was reading - repeatedly - that installing a linux bootloader where it belongs (the MBR) will royally bad_word my windows install.
[03:28] <bob2> presumably they're in g/gtk/
[03:28] <bob2> or g/gtk2.0/ or something
[03:28] <TD> oh, i see
[03:28] <TD> yeah
[03:28] <TD> not named consistently
[03:28] <bob2> Crembo: it will absolutely nuke the windows boot loaders and replace it with grub
[03:28] <bob2> grub will be setup with options to boot windows or ubuntu
[03:29] <pcharky> Crembo: You can boot windows from grub.
[03:29] <Crembo> hoary does all that automatically during install?

[03:29] <Crembo> I got the impression from the forums and wiki you had to do a complex series of steps to get it to work.
[03:29] <bob2> no
[03:29] <bob2> the forums people sometimes seem to enjoy making things ridiculously complicated
[03:29] <bob2> if grub doesn't come up with options for windows and ubuntu, you've found a bug
[03:30] <pcharky> Crembo: SO you want to install ubuntu.. right?
[03:30] <Crembo> as a matter of fact, this is the page that got me started on my journey: https://wiki.ubuntu.com//WindowsDualBootHowTo
[03:31] <pcharky> Crembo: Because you started out asking a question about the livecd.
[03:31] <Crembo> pcharky: trying to learn linux, as part of the "onoes Longhorn DRM MS sucks better bail" bandwagon. not noble, but hey, it's something to tinker with in my free time.

[03:32] <Belutz> hai all....
[03:32] <Belutz> why there is no php5 package in synaptic?
[03:32] <Seveas> Crembo, dual boot with windows requires no special steps at all, it will be taken care off automatically
[03:33] <Dr_Melectaus> Is the help site with info on how to run games on ubuntu ubuntuguide.org
