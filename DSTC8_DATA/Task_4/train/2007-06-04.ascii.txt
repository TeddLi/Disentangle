[09:35] <malmen> hell
[09:35] <LjL> schigh: a hard link is simply a redundant reference to a file. every file, as you know, is referenced by a filename; a hardlink simply gives it another filename.
[09:35] <unimatrix9> :P
[09:35] <malmen> anyone here use php-gtk ?
[09:35] <Baubal> LjL: cp -a directory /blah without *'s.  excellent - will give that a shot, thank you kindly
[09:35] <unimatrix9> but i am sure all will be helpfull here...
[09:35] <dgt84> schigh: "Unlike a hard link, a symbolic link does not point directly to data, but merely contains a symbolic path which an operating system uses to identify a hard link (or another symbolic link). Thus, when a user removes a symbolic link, the file to which it pointed remains unaffected. (In contrast, the removal of a hard link will result in the removal of the file if that file has no other hard links.)" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link

=== aubade_ [n=aubade@oh-67-77-30-90.dyn.embarqhsd.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[09:36] <LjL> schigh: when you create a hardlink, a counter for the file is incremented. when you remove one, it's decremented. this way, when you "rm" a file, the filesystem knows that the space should only be marked as free if there are no more links left

[09:36] <LjL> schigh: with symbolic links, on the other hand, the filesystem couldn't care less. if you remove the file the symlink pointed to, the symlink will point to nothing anymore. if you remove the symlink, only the symlink is removed.

[09:45] <vIkSiT> an apt-cache search gets me nothing
[09:45] <unimatrix9> This because, GAIM comes in standard with Ubuntu, so while uninstalling GAIM, it would find a dependency on ubuntu-desktop and would ask that you remove that too. Although it is perfectly alrite to remove ubuntu-desktop as it is only a meta package, you would enter a dependency hell, if and ever you tried to upgrade later.
[09:45] <Jowi> jburd, if you are dist-upgrading (changing from current version of ubuntu to the next one) then it will not matter much

[09:49] <Anton99> gaim sounds better ;)
[09:49] <aquafina> yeah it does
[09:49] <aquafina> but there was some kind of trouble with aol
[09:49] <Jowi> Anton99, some issues with AOL
[09:49] <kuroaisu> it's the result of a lawsuit
[09:49] <jburd> AOL threatened to sue Sean and folks for using "AIM" in their name.
[09:49] <aquafina> stupid aol...
[09:49] <unimatrix9> i see there are deb files of pidgin around on the net too
[09:49] <Anton99> it is registred trademark AIM?
=== keios [n=kashif@122.162.107.33]  has joined #ubuntu
[09:49] <jburd> No. AOL didn't have a problem earlier.  However, Gaim had been getting decent popularity.
[09:50] <kuroaisu> yah, stupid aol, trying to protect their trademark as required under US law..
[09:50] <Corvinis-V> is there a nice apache/php/mysql package for linux like xampp that's safe for production usage?
[09:50] <jburd> AOL couldn't take it.

[09:50] <jburd> By the way, Google employed Gaim's lead developer.
[09:50] <Paddy_EIRE> could someone tell me why when I go to ntfs configuration tool it loads up nicely and shows that I have "/dev/sda2" which is a vista install, then when I tick the box to enable support and add a mount point such as "/media/windows" it gives me this error "/media/windows" contains an invalid character please choose a name not a directory

[09:53] <OhMyAudi> LjL: I heard that kde that ships with (k)ubuntu is not very stable
[09:53] <LjL> !debian | Anton99
[09:53] <ubotu> Anton99: Ubuntu and Debian are closely related. Ubuntu builds on the foundations of Debian architecture and infrastructure, with a different community and release process. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationship - Remember, !repositories meant for Debian should NOT be used on Ubuntu!
[09:53] <skathirgamu> I have HP LaserJet 4050 Series printer on the network .. when i configure the printer its always send to the tray 1 .. even i configure to send to the tray 2 .. does anybody know why .. and the tray 1 is the testing tray so i am not able to print it. could somebody help ?
[09:53] <OhMyAudi> LjL: I was also under the impressions that the kubuntu guys were on their own team separate from the ubuntu people
[09:53] <Corvinis-V> so now for my question.... did someone have an answer? about the apache/php/mysql combo ?
[09:53] <Anton99> !rpm
[09:53] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu uses !APT, not RPM. RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
=== geoaxis [n=hatim@unaffiliated/geoaxis]  has joined #ubuntu
[09:53] <LjL> OhMyAudi: ?! even if that were the case, what's the reasoning behind installing kde-core instead? it's not a *different* kde, it's the same packages. just a more restricted set of them.
[09:53] <OhMyAudi> LjL: That's why I was wondering if the kde-core was direct from the kde repositories or the same a kubuntu without all the junk

[09:54] <LjL> OhMyAudi, teams may be separate, but there is nothing else separate. the Ubuntu repositories are the same as the Kubuntu repositories. Kubuntu is just Ubuntu with KDE (and a selection of KDE apps) installed instead of GNOME.

[09:56] <pietro10> !vmware
[09:56] <ubotu> VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository (package "vmware-player"), and http://www.easyvmx.com/easyvmx.shtml can create VMs for it. For VMWare Server, instructions can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware - See also !virtualizers

[10:09] <LjL> lauriexxx: anyway, that line (if there is only that line) would seem to indicate that no backup was made. so dpkg-reconfigure again and try to make it work. select the "vesa" driver for failsafe X startup. if you have an nvidia card, you can try selecting "nv", and if you have ati, i think it's "ati" ("nv" and "ati" as opposed to the proprietary drivers)

[10:18] <aricz> Hi, trying again.. I have 1 CDROM and 1 CD-/DVDROM.. the dvdrom I'm pretty sure still works, but, because of hardwareproblems, I can't open it anymore.. so I have to access my CDROM instead.. but where? and how? Do I have to uninstall the CD-/DVDROM first?

[10:27] <phil56> Scunizi: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=464233 The thread I started
[10:27] <Jowi> arch_, the reason you need to do this is because most programs use /dev/dvd as default, but the problem is that only one drive can be linked to /dev/dvd. so you must specify the device in mplayer.
[10:28] <Scunizi> phil56, k... I'll look at it.

[10:49] <eetfuk> Jowi, thanks it worked
[10:49] <NeuraL> ubuntu rocks!
[10:49] <hjmills> Central, what graphics card do you have?
[10:49] <arch_> Jowi: wow, the following command works: "mplayer -dvd-device /dev/hdc dvd://" thanks.

[10:49] <LjL> Eleaf, we're running in circles. your hardware clock obviously does NOT work fine since it's off by 13 hours after booting.
[10:49] <oooc> im fairly new to ubuntu
[10:49] <NeuraL> ;-)
[10:49] <Jowi> eetfuk, you're welcome
[10:49] <Eleaf> thanks LjL , I'll see if it syncs now.
[10:49] <Central> How do I check? It's a Gforce 7900GS or something.
[10:50] <LjL> Eleaf: *after* the system has booted, the hardware clock is *not* used anymore
[10:50] <Jowi> arch_, you're welcome too :)
[10:50] <ryanakca> is there a way to make certain apps take just a certain amount of system ressources?
[10:50] <hjmills> Central, then its Nvidia?
[10:50] <LjL> Eleaf: when the system is running, Linux keeps a *software* clock.
[10:50] <EADG> Ropechoborra: You will have to port forward on the lan's router then connect with ssh i.p.addy -p 1234
[10:50] <oooc> i dont understand what is process
[10:50] <Central> yeah
[10:50] <lauriexxx> oooc: what processor do you have, or which wireless card do you have?
[10:50] <Eleaf> LjL, I see.  I think it also gets out of sync when the computer is sleeping.
[10:50] <Spec> Central: lspci -v |grep -i force
[10:50] <Jowi> Central, didn't you just order from shipit yesterday!? :D
[10:50] <hjmills> Central, ok, if you go to System>Preferences>Desktop Effects
[10:50] <kitche> LjL: my bios clock was setup to GMT time lol couldn't fiugre it out hwy my time was always wrong in linux until I looked at my bios
[10:50] <Central> yes I did, but my friend gave me a CD
[10:50] <oooc> ok. i have a intel p4 3.ghz and a belkin g usb wifi
[10:50] <NeuraL> I have just attached my bluetooth dongle and it works perfectly
[10:50] <LjL> kitche: but that only goes if you dual boot.

[10:50] <aricz> Hullu, how do I get my CD-ROM working? I have 1.storage_model_TSSTcorpCD/DVDW_TS_H552B and 2.storage_model_SONY_CD_RW_CRX160E.. both are symlinked (?) in /etc/fstab .. but there's nothing in /media/cdrom0 and /media/cdrom1 .. can anyone please help me?
[10:51] <hjmills> Central, it should say something about needing to install the nvidia driver - say yes and give it your password
[10:51] <Ropechoborra> EADG Thanks, if i dont have access to the router, is there other way ?
[10:51] <Scunizi> phil56, I got it.. So you're hosting and would like someone else to come in securely?
[10:51] <lauriexxx> oooc: have you tried downloading wifi-radar??
[10:51] <phil56> yes
[10:51] <oooc> im not sure what model my belkin stick is. also my processor is like a duo or something.
[10:51] <phil56> me actually
[10:51] <Central> It did not ask a password
[10:51] <kitche> LjL: well I fixed my bios clock and now my time reads correctly all the time if I use a installed system

[10:52] <phil56> Scunizi: I want this to happen over ssh.simple idea
[10:52] <Scunizi> Is the html for the page run on apache?  (probably a dumb question)
[10:52] <Central> should I reboot now? and come back?
[10:52] <LjL> kitche: there's nothing wrong with the BIOS clock being set to GMT, unless one dual boots with systems that want it set to something else. actually, i think it's the default.
[10:52] <oooc> no its a P4 3.Ghz BUT ITS DOWN TWICE
[10:52] <sonictwin> whats the name of the audio burning app?
[10:52] <oooc> didnt mean to shout
[10:52] <oooc> sorry
[10:52] <Scunizi> phil56, see my post right after your last one.
[10:52] <hjmills> Central, yes, thats fine, go ahead and reboot then come back here - you dont really need desktop effects but it makes the driver installation easier
