<s> <user> doesnt know what a capitalist is </s>
<s> hey , did anyone here see microsofts attempts to take down linux ? </s>
<s> by saying it costs more etc etc ? </s>

<s> ( cedega ) </s>
<s> <user> , ok </s>
<s> okay , i missed something during the installation </s>
<s> <user> , also on the amd64 then ? </s>
<s> <user> , i have been reading that site , and i still ca n't get anything happening </s>
<s> because my first user is not in the sudoers </s>
<s> <user> : yeah </s>
<s> cool :) </s>
<s> <unka> , ye u prob need no cd crack </s>
<s> <user> , ye u prob need no cd crack </s>
<s> it would probably also work better if you actually bought the game </s>
<s> should i have to reinstall ? or is there any solution without running installation again </s>
<s> <user> , did u check DIR/etc/ DIR/fstab/ and dmesg </s>
<s> <user> , this has changed in hoary </s>
<s> its already cracked <user> </s>
<s> oh ? </s>
<s> and is ur usb working <user> </s>
<s> <user> , ok </s>
<s> i just run it , and it tries to init , and then dies </s>
<s> <user> , dmesg says that it found a removable scsi disk sda at <unk#a> </s>
<s> could the fact that im running it on ro filesystem affect it ? </s>
<s> <user> , thats a good thing , wat about fstab </s>
<s> does n't say anything about it </s>
<s> <user> , ye i read up on that at some places for diablo2 </s>
<s> not sure if its related </s>
<s> mmm </s>
<s> is captive-ntfs supposed to support r/w </s>
<s> <user> , no entry for it in fstab </s>
<s> <user> , well ye u prob need that in there first </s>
<s> and install some of those tools and start up k3b after that </s>
<s> ca n't i had my first user to sudoers ? </s>
<s> your first user ( the one you create on install ) is in sudoers </s>
<s> that is the problem </s>
<s> u dont want it in sudoers ? </s>
<s> my first user , the one i created during install doesnt appear in sudoers file </s>
<s> oh <unka> </s>
<s> sorry , user <user> may not run sudo on </s>
<s> hey is there anyway i can possibly force an unmount of a cd drive ? </s>
<s> heh </s>
<s> good one jeff </s>
<s> umount -f DIR/mnt/ DIR/cdrom0/ </s>
<s> -f forces </s>
<s> from the terminal ofcourse </s>
<s> <user> <unka[_~> <unk#a-.@]_> has joined #ubuntu </s>
<s> argh linux seems to pussy foot around the fact of unmounting cd drives </s>
<s> if its mounted and semi in use </s>
<s> you cant eject it </s>
<s> i never seem to have a problem </s>
<s> why can windows do this so easily ? </s>
<s> no , im in the middle of a raven shield install </s>
<s> i ran cedega setup.exe </s>
<s> could you paste your file DIR/etc/ DIR/sudoers/ please ? </s>
<s> windows doesnt take control of the cdrom </s>
<s> linux appears to take control of it at a more hardware level </s>
<s> but ... whats the benefit of that ? </s>
<s> nfi , it just works for me </s>
<s> and why ca n't i just say " i really need that cd , emergency eject " </s>
<s> the only rare case i use umount -f is when i incorrectly burn a cd </s>
<s> yeh </s>
<s> but i got an install running off the cd </s>
<s> and it wont take it </s>
<s> ok i think that it works </s>
<s> how can i config the pass for sudo ? </s>
<s> cuz he does n't ask me the password </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a[_~> <unka.@]_> has joined #ubuntu </s>
<s> if anyone could paste his file DIR/etc/ DIR/sudoers/ , i think it would help me </s>
<s> <user> , what do you mean ? not asking for password ? </s>
<s> have you entered it within the last 15 minutes ? </s>
<s> <user> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> my first user was n't in sudoers file </s>
<s> <user> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> so i wrote ( with visudo ) <user> all=(all ) all </s>
<s> so the pass isnt needed </s>
<s> as for root account . </s>
<s> i just want that when i want to change something in system configuration or anything else , it asks me a password </s>
