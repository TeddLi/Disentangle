[16:49] <ftpvk> IS THERE AN AVANT WINDOWS EXPERT HERE
[16:49] <luc|f3r> its done
[16:49] <jamesm> crickey  -- he left
[16:49] <luc|f3r> gonna reboot
[16:49] <bod_> bazhang, yer
[16:49] <Nulo> stelt, in htat case what you need is to mount it properly, not re-partition it.
[16:49] <bod_> maximilion, right click on an mp3 file
[16:49] <VOiCi> Anyone know a tool to extract data from .swf on linux
[16:49] <bod_> maximilion, properties, theres a tab caled open with,m.,. change default in there
[16:49] <k0p> Hi. a macbook santa rosa works with ubuntu 32 bits? I install and I have a troubles with wireless. do u know something about it?
[16:50] <lolfrenz> VOiCi, flasm
[16:50] <eth01> k0p, incompatible.
[16:50] <bazhang> bod_: but the main issue is how much you allow for upload at one time--not how long you seed for
[16:50] <bod_> !SHOUT | ftpvk
[16:50] <ubotu> ftpvk: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[16:50] <stelt> Nulo, i know, but mount says it's not ntfs (while cfdisk says it is)
[16:50] <k0p> eth01: so.. only with ubuntu 64bits?
[16:50] <VOiCi> lolfrenz, thanks :)
[16:50] <eth01> ftpvk, #windows
[16:50] <ftpvk> okay okay
[16:50] <maximilion> bod_: Lovely! Thanks.
[16:50] <luc|f3r> how do i boot it?
[16:51] <eth01> k0p, you think that'll make a difference?
[16:51] <luc|f3r> do i need to reboot?
[16:51] <ftpvk> so is there
[16:51] <jamesm> VOiCi: what are you trying to extract from the file -- data and code or pics ?
[16:51] <oboy03> finally
[16:51] <eth01> ftpvk, ?
[16:51] <Nulo> stelt, in that case i'm afraid i can't help you.
[16:51] <bod_> bazhang, you misunderstand me,. 10 seeders, 5 leechers = 20% capacity per leecher,. if you upload speed is at unlimited and someone else is at 1kbps the torrent program will give you some of there % because you are seeding more then them
[16:51] <VOiCi> jamesm, text
[16:51] <bazhang> luc|f3r: you got the livecd burned to disk? then just reboot with it in the cd drive--though you may have to point the bios to look for it first
[16:51] <bod_> maximilion, no probs
[16:51] <k0p> eth01: I don't know.. Time ago there aren't some software to ubuntu 64bits. am I right?
[16:52] <ftpvk> anyone??
[16:52] <maximilion> bod_: What do you use for torrents?
[16:52] <k0p> eth01: like w32codecs..
[16:52] <ftpvk> anyone??
[16:52] <bod_> maximilion, i use deluge, but i might change to transmission,.,.;~)

[16:53] <sveakex> is there a lithuanian ubuntu channel?
[16:53] <oboy03> now i got a broken package oclock
[16:53] <oboy03> :(
[16:53] <sveakex> bod_: he meant awn
[16:53] <bod_> !lithuania
[16:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lithuania - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[16:53] <bazhang> whoaitsphil: that sounds serious--could you try the install process from the beginning again?
[16:53] <bod_> sveakex, oops,.,. i dont know what an awn is,.,.lol,.,ty
[16:54] <whoaitsphil> when i do i have to go through the partition options again and the HDD space is missing...30gb that i allocated to the first install
[16:54] <sveakex> bod_: awant windows navigator i think
[16:54] <sveakex> bod_: avant*
[16:54] <bod_> sveakex, ok,.ty
[16:54] <sveakex> ^^
[16:54] <bazhang> maximilion: transmission goes through port 80 so no port forward or firewall hassle at all
[16:54] <bod_> whoaitsphil, i have a solution
[16:54] <stelt> how do i format a ntfs partition?
=== Veinor|ZzZ is now known as Veinor
[16:55] <oboy03> what should i do with oclock as broken package?
[16:55] <whoaitsphil> yes, bod?
[16:55] <Catachan> any one know how to change the color of the screen that pops up right after you log in to gnome?
[16:55] <bazhang> oboy03: what is oclock
[16:55] <bod_> whoaitsphil, put your xp cd in and begin an install, dw, were not gonna reinstall it,. it will get to a partition manager thing,. delete the partition given for ubuntu, then create a new empty partition, then power off
[16:55] <whoaitsphil> ahhh yes
[16:55] <bod_> ;~)
[16:55] <whoaitsphil> great idea
[16:55] <whoaitsphil> gonna try it now
[16:56] <bod_> kk,.lemme no how it goes
[16:56] <oboy03> i dunno it says i have a broken package oclock
[16:56] <whoaitsphil> k thanks
[16:56] <bod_> np
[16:56] <oboy03> should i remove it?
[16:56] <middayc> which linux distro supports widest array of hardware? I am trying to install multiple variations of debian and ubuntu on compaq w6000 workstation since yesterday without any luck
[16:56] <bod_> bazhang, why is it, when i come in for a question, i end up staying answering loads more?,.,.lol,.,. i dont mind though,.,.:~)
[16:56] <iari_> Does anyone know why my Laptop doesn't come out of hibernate/Suspend mode ?
[16:57] <sveakex> middayc: probably none if ubuntu won't go
[16:57] <oboy03> ubuntu is frustrating :(
[16:57] <bod_> iari_, check power settings in your system bios
[16:57] <bazhang> oboy03: sounds like there are either internet connection problems on your end or server issues--you might want to try another server and see if that helps out
[16:57] <bod_> oboy03, only when you dont know how to fix it
[16:57] <oboy03> hope i can just inject all the info in my head :)
[16:57] <maximilion> bazhang: ok, will try an apt-get
[16:57] <iari_> bod_: What should I be looking for?
[16:57] <oboy03> yeah
[16:57] <bazhang> bod_: hahaha
[16:57] <oboy03> ok
[16:57] <oboy03> i'll try those
[16:58] <RainCT> Hi
[16:58] <oboy03> i'll reboot my pc and modem
[16:58] <bod_> iari_, -->power settings--> anythiong to do with hibernation/sleep,
[16:58] <bazhang> middayc: ubuntu--but we have to say that in #ubuntu ;]
[16:58] <ftpvk> is there a good mathematics-plotting software for linux?
[16:58] <iari_> bod_: Thank you I'll try..
[16:59] <RainCT> Do you know if there's any program to freeze an account (so that any change the users do will be reverted on reboot)?
[16:59] <bod_> middayc, we are biased in here,.,.;~)
[16:59] <jrib> ftpvk: gnuplot?
[16:59] <bod_> iari_np
[16:59] <ftpvk> anything else
[16:59] <maximilion> oh, never mind :) Opera's bittorrent is running at 280KB/s :D
[16:59] <ftpvk> can you do it with octave
[16:59] <bazhang> hehe
[16:59] <maximilion> Must have tried a dead torrent before
[16:59] <sveakex> maximilion: why not use rtorrent? :P
[16:59] <jrib> ftpvk: yes
[17:00] <ftpvk> which is better, you think
[17:00] <dimedo> hi there, can anyone help me cross-compiling a library for i386 arch on my ubuntu amd64 machine?
[17:00] <bod_> RainCT, i seem to remember something about *nix systems keeping a log of every command done, wether threw terminal or gui,.,. research it??maybe??
[17:00] <jrib> ftpvk: they've both done what I've needed them to do.  Why not just try both?
[17:01] <jrib> ftpvk: octave apparently uses gnuplot anyway: http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/textbooks/octave/octave_15.html
[17:01] <maximilion> Well, I've always been an Opera fan, and since 9.2 when it works with every single banking, security, etc page on the net I've become an Opera fan-atic :D If Opera had WebDev plugin and Firebug I'd delete Firefox as I have IE ;)
[17:01] <spike> hi, is anybody using postit?
[17:01] <bod_> notes!
[17:01] <bod_> no sorry
[17:01] <maximilion> As I have _deleted_ IE (clarification)
[17:01] <oboy03> im back

[17:02] <bod_> brb,. nature calls
[17:02] <helyo> hello, anyone installed E17 from Elbuntu repos?? Cause I have questions please.
[17:02] <oboy03> what do u usually do with broken packages? completely remove?
[17:02] <ftpvk> jrib: which one do you find more user friendly
[17:02] <Jouva> Is there a way I can get the gdm login screen's monitor resolution to match that of what I use for my desktop session? For one thing it gets a little annoying when it has to switch between the resolutions after login, and secondly, the gdm screen looks squished
[17:02] <maximilion> OK, 1240KB/s now :P
[17:03] <hieppo> does anyone know how I can set up my apc ups?
[17:03] <jrib> ftpvk: they're the same, you need to make this decision based on *your* ideas of what makes something user-friendly
[17:03] <hieppo> it is a usb version?  I don't know if ubuntu automatically install the driver
[17:03] <ftpvk> jrib:ok, thanks!
[17:04] <jrib> ftpvk: np
[17:04] <RainCT> bod_: I was thinking on something simpler (like keeping a compressed copy of the home dir and then removing /home/<user> on startup and restoring it from the copy).. Actually, I already started a script for this, but if a program for this already existed it would save me some work
[17:04] <RainCT> well, another question then.. how can I disable the beep that the terminal does (including in tty's, not only gnome-terminal)?
[17:04] <hieppo> any help is appreciated.
[17:05] <jburd> Why the heck on Earth am I dealing with a stupid mount problem in 2008?
[17:05] <ePax> I have dualboot ubuntu ant vista... how do i remove ubuntu... i have to return my comp? anyone?
=== simon__ is now known as Zicks
[17:05] <bod_> RainCT, if you want a script that replaces /home    cant that be done with 1 command,.,. sudo cp /path/to/backup /home      (and force yes to all questions)
[17:05] <bazhang> ePax: remove ubuntu? in #ubuntu ? perhaps not the right place to ask ;]
[17:05] <hon> ePax: they usually reinstall the OS on return computers.
[17:05] <bod_> RainCT, its a modprobe,. 1 sec
[17:05] <oboy03> i am now completely removing oclock broken package
[17:06] <RainCT> bod_: indeed, but with simple I didn't mean *that* simple :)
[17:06] <unstable> I want to burn 8 gigs, onto a dual layer dvd. it's lots and lots of files and directories, can I just burn these as is... or do I need to wrap them up?
[17:06] <helyo> hello, anyone installed E17 from Elbuntu repos?? Cause I have questions please.
[17:06] <sveakex> ePax: you can edit your partitions in vista i think, there is a software built in for it. however i do not know how it will affect your MBR so you might have to overwrite that, in XP you boot with the xp cd and rewrite it
[17:06] <ePax> bazhang: Pleae save me dumb comment... as i said... im returning my comp and changing to another one... wich in that case means that anothe rone will run ubuntu
[17:06] <geoaxis> if i have my mail stored in mbox format at a place
[17:07] <bod_> RainCT, third post down : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=531781 ,.,. and what will your script be doing exactly?
[17:07] <ePax> sveakex: thank you very much
[17:07] <oboy03> anyway
[17:07] <whoaitsphil> bod, i went in the XP setup cd but when i got to the partition screen it froze...which is weird i've never had that freeze before...but i had 30gb NTFS with 15gb used...had to be my XP partition...then 1800mb unknown and 43gb unknown...so it might actually be working right i'm gonna have to go into the ubuntu partition installer again and probably do manual?
[17:07] <geoaxis> how can i retrieve it to a new location in maildir format
[17:07] <oboy03> bazhang thanks for the help
[17:07] <geoaxis> ( i am migrating my services)
[17:07] <bazhang> ePax: again--no idea about ##windows
[17:07] <oboy03> seems i got more problems now
[17:07] <enzo> ali_ is that you ali1234 ?
[17:07] <sveakex> ePax: google around for more about the MBR issues with vista. :)
[17:07] <sveakex> ePax: and how to partition it within vista
[17:07] <oboy03> i mean its not because you helped me
[17:07] <oboy03> anyway
[17:07] <RainCT> bod_: thanks
[17:07] <Pici> ePax: or ask in ##windows
[17:07] <bod_> whoaitsphil, how many os's or partitions do you have/need    ??
[17:08] <whoaitsphil> i only have XP installed
[17:08] <whoaitsphil> and i want ubuntu installed as well
[17:08] <whoaitsphil> simple dual boot
[17:08] <bod_> RainCT, your script? what exactly do you want it to do?
[17:08] <whoaitsphil> i've done it many times before...but i got screwed up cause of a cd rom read error this time on install
[17:08] <ePax> sveakex: i hade problem with mbr and i kinda solved it... cos vista would boot... not that i use vista much... but i kinda payed for it
[17:08] <eagle-101> whoaitsphil, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot
[17:09] <oboy03> aahahahah
[17:09] <KenSentMe> Is the uuid in /etc/fstab unique for a certain hd? If i put in a certain disk and mount it to /media/disk_a and have another line in fstab for a second hd that i want to be mounted in /media/disk_b, will the uuid make sure the different drives are mounted to the proper folder, even if they are both for example /dev/sdb1?
[17:09] <bod_> whoaitsphil, firstly id do it cean,.,. meaning remove all partitions except the xp, then use the ubuntu cd,.,. but you right click on my computer, theres a choice called 'manage'  in there you can remove partitions
[17:09] <oboy03> now even the terminal is messed up
[17:09] <sveakex> ePax: if you know hot to solve the mbr issue then it is only the removing partitions one left (within vista) ;)
[17:09] <oboy03> another child process problem
[17:09] <whoaitsphil> ok...well i was doing it clean...i only had XP installed and then i was installing ubuntu
[17:09] <eagle-101> KenSentMe, what do you mean by uid?
[17:09] <whoaitsphil> ubuntu just booted again by cd..im gonna see what i can do
[17:09] <KenSentMe> eagle-101, there is a uuid in /etc/fstab for every partition
[17:09] <sveakex> ePax: my vista got unusable after 6 months until i went over to ubuntu and then to arch linux
[17:10] <bod_> whoaitsphil, you said you had unexplained/unneeded partitions,.,. start again with just the 1
[17:10] <Assid> heya
[17:10] <eagle-101> KenSentMe, under proc? my fstab does not mention uid at all
[17:10] <BabyDoll> hey guys its me luc|f3r
[17:10] <bod_> hi
[17:10] <ePax> sveakex: i got bluescreen 2 hours after i started vista
[17:10] <ePax> :D
[17:10] <whoaitsphil> well i had a bad partition because ubuntu only half installed on it
[17:10] <KenSentMe> eagle-101, mine does
[17:10] <BabyDoll> so im on the livecd and it sees the card but it wont connect
[17:10] <whoaitsphil> thats the one i gotta get rid of and redo
[17:10] <Assid> ePax: i just formatted xp to get on hardy alpha
[17:10] <eagle-101> KenSentMe, here is mine http://rafb.net/p/m2ZduX85.html
[17:10] <bod_> whoaitsphil, do it in the 'manage' thing i told you about
[17:10] <sveakex> ePax: hehe, stick to ubuntu or any other linux distro is my advice, but do what you want to do ;)
[17:10] <Assid> decided xp makes good for gaming.. and lets just keep it there if possible
[17:11] <oboy03> i guess reformatting will easily solve my problems
[17:11] <eagle-101> whoaitsphil, ah, ok, open up fdisk, find the bad partition and delete it
[17:11] <sveakex> Assid: Wintendo 32bit XP Edition ;)
[17:11] <KenSentMe> eagle-101, the uuid is at the beginning of the lines in my fstab
[17:11] <BabyDoll> what i do to get my wiresless card working right?
[17:11] <eagle-101> KenSentMe, wanna pastebin yours?
[17:11] <RainCT> bod_: get the settings from a configuration file, have a command to gain root permission without being in the admin group (still have to look how to do this) and take a new copy of the home directory set in the config file, and restore it from there on boot (and on the way empty the printer jobs queue). isn't really much, but I asked as if there's something like this with GUI it would indeed be better
[17:11] <sveakex> Assid: or even better, Wintendo32 XP Edition, haha XD
[17:11] <Assid> sveakex: more like XPot 32 edition

[17:22] <^Elfboy> read the http://www.pastebin.ca/895189
[17:22] <bazhang> heh
[17:22] <Bodsda> ^Elfboy, i did
[17:23] <Bodsda> ^Elfboy, it tells you what to do to fix it,.,??
[17:23] <^Elfboy> umm then i did not understan it :)
[17:24] <Bodsda> ^Elfboy,  get the ncurses library
[17:24] <^Elfboy> kk
[17:24] <^Elfboy> just apt-get http://www.pastebin.ca/895189
[17:24] <^Elfboy> ops
[17:24] <Bodsda> bazhang, do you ever find yourself fixing people problems, with commen sense and logic, even if you dont really no what your doing?
[17:24] <stupid> On the installation live-cd, how do i reach the terminal if i cannot get into X ?
[17:24] <^Elfboy> just apt-get ncurses library
[17:25] <Bodsda> ^Elfboy, synaptic search the word        ncurses
[17:25] <Bodsda> stupid, recovery mode from grub,.,. or i think its like ctrl+F1     not sure though
[17:26] <mocoloco> >stupid, just hit crt+alt+F2 and you'll be at a terminal
[17:26] <Bodsda> mocoloco, ty,. il remember that,.,.:~)
[17:26] <mocoloco> ctrl+alt+F1-6 are all terminals in fact, and ctrl+alt+F7 is your first graphical login (when X is working of course)
[17:27] <Bodsda> mocoloco, are they run levels?
[17:27] <^Elfboy> sorry to sound stupid but this is my frist time with ubuntu so how do i  synaptic search ncurses
[17:27] <^Elfboy> im use to portage :)
[17:27] <mocoloco> not sure bodsda, I never really learned what that means :)
[17:27] <Jouva> Bodsda: F1-F6? No they're just virtual terminals
[17:28] <Bodsda> ^Elfboy, System-->Admin-->Synaptic    when there click the search button, then type    ncurses    then click search,.,.sorry i didnt realise you were a new user
[17:28] <^Elfboy> umm
[17:28] <bazhang> Bodsda: hehe dont tell others ;]
[17:28] <^Elfboy> no x
[17:28] <Bodsda> Jouva, ok,.,.ty,.,.virtual?
[17:28] <^Elfboy> its a server
[17:28] <Bodsda> ^Elfboy, ah,.,.hang on,. il find the exact package name for you
[17:28] <Jouva> Bodsda: As opposed to physical :)
[17:28] <RainCT> Bodsda: let it get the configuration from /etc/freeze.conf (which could be for example something like http://paste.ubuntu.com/4309/, but doesn't need to be exactly like that), let the save option take the name of which's users home you want to re-copy (also allow "all" to copy them all again, or try to detect if the user who is running the command is in the config file and use that one if no other one is indicated;
[17:28] <RainCT> Bodsda:  the script should become $admin and from there gain sudo powers to copy the dir), and the 'start' part should be run for all users in the config file. I think I had thought of something more but I can't remember now..
[17:28] <RichiH> ^Elfboy: aptitude search ncurses
[17:28] <^Elfboy> ok thanks Bodsda thanks
[17:29] <RichiH> ^Elfboy: or apt-cache search, if you prefer
[17:29] <RichiH> ^Elfboy: both work on cli
[17:29] <mocoloco> elfboy, do sudo aptitude.  it's not too tough to search in there.  Ctrl-T will open the menu, from there you can figure it out fairly easily
[17:30] <Bodsda> RainCT, i thought you just wanted to make sure any changes done by a certain user (eg 1 person) was reverted on reboot?
[17:30] <Bodsda> ^Elfboy, i cant find that package in my synaptic, might be a server thing,.,. sorry not to sure
[17:31] <^Elfboy> ok
[17:31] <^Elfboy> thanks
[17:31] <Bodsda> Jouva, as opposed to physical,. i believe that nothing on my screen i can phsically minipulate because its all virtual?
[17:31] <RainCT> Bodsda: yes..
[17:31] <BabyDoll> ...
[17:31] <RichiH> ^Elfboy: did you read what i wrote?
[17:31] <Jouva> Bodsda: 6 terminals as opposed to 6 physical monitors :P
[17:32] <Bodsda> RainCT, if you just want to revert changes on one account, i think your overcomplicating things
[17:32] <Jouva> err
[17:32] <Jouva> Bodsda: 6 "virtual" terminals as opposed to 6 physical monitors :P
[17:32] <Bodsda> Jouva, right, got ya
[17:32] <Bodsda> ty
[17:32] <Bodsda> :~)
[17:32] <Catachan> any one know how to change the color of the screen that pops up right after you log in to gnome?
[17:32] <Jouva> Bodsda: Essentially the runlevel includes information on how many terminals to create and what daemons to run on startup. And the default one for Ubuntu desktop includes running GNOME Display Manager
[17:33] <bXi> anyone here with a dell xps m1730?
[17:33] <Jouva> Catachan: System -> Preferences -> Appearance
[17:33] <whoaitsphil> bod i got a problem...
[17:33] <Bodsda> ?
[17:33] <RainCT> Bodsda: atm it's only one account but it might become more (and I'm planning to improve it in the future, like also creating a GUI for it)
[17:33] <Bodsda> oh,.ok
[17:33] <whoaitsphil> i've deleted the old partition of the failed ubuntu install
[17:33] <Drakaen> Question... how can I access my Linux Drive while in windows?
[17:33] <helyo> Hello anyone has installed E17 on Gutsy?
[17:33] <Bodsda> whoaitsphil, so?
[17:33] <^Elfboy> RichiH: sorry i did not see what u ssaid
[17:34] <RainCT> Bodsda: anyway, if you see anything you can improve on what I send you please feel free to do so :)
[17:34] <mocoloco> Catachan, that's a bug that causes it to be brown, even when you change the color in the login screen settings.  Let me find you a link to the fix...
[17:34] <Bodsda> RainCT, ah ok,.,. im not as good at scripting as you,.,.:~)
[17:34] <Catachan> Jouva, that seems to only affect the desktop color and the login screen's color. Between the log in screen and the fully loaded desk top I get that orangish color on my monitor
[17:34] <whoaitsphil> so right now under my manual parition editor in ubuntu it has sda1 32gb NTFS...sda2 45gb ext3...and sda5 1990mb swap
[17:34] <Catachan> mocoloco, that would be appreciated
[17:34] <whoaitsphil> the 32gb ntfs is my window.s..i really dont wanna lose anything on that
[17:34] <Catachan> thank you
[17:34] <Jouva> Drakaen: That's a big 100% definite absolute... maybe. You essentially need drivers in windows that support the particular file system used. Overall, don't expect full working support :)
[17:35] <iari> My laptop doesn't go into hibernation / Suspend mode. When I try switching to hibernate the screen goes black and there's a blinking '_' like DOS mode... I can't type or do anything except shutting down using the power button..
[17:35] <whoaitsphil> sda2 has been deleted and created again but when i try to install ubuntu on it, it says there is an error and cant do it
[17:35] <Bodsda> whoaitsphil, what error?
[17:35] <RichiH> ^Elfboy: use apt-cache search and/or aptitude search to look for ncurses packages
[17:35] <mocoloco> Here's the GDM background color fix http://bapoumba.wordpress.com/2007/10/24/change-gdm-background-color-to-match-your-gdm-theme-applies-to-xfce/
[17:35] <Drakaen> i am just looking at passing files back and forth like u can do the other way (linux able to open the windows drive
[17:36] <^Elfboy> RichiH:  thansk it list a lot fo file
[17:36] <Catachan> whoaitsphil, did you make sure to format sda2 as an ext2 or preferably ext3?
[17:36] <Jouva> Drakaen: Write access may be MUCH harder to come across than read access at all
[17:36] <whoaitsphil> all i did was delete it
[17:36] <Drakaen> ahh
[17:36] <whoaitsphil> then go back and do the guided
[17:36] <mocoloco> just noticed it says xfce, but it works for anything using gdm, ie gnome
[17:36] <whoaitsphil> and it says
[17:36] <Jouva> Drakaen: If you went with defaults, I believe the default is ext3. So you'll need to find something that lets you mount ext3 within windows
[17:36] <corvus>  join #ubuntu-fr
[17:36] <Riddell> ** if anyone is using gutsy and flashplugin-nonfree please ping me
[17:37] <danbhfive> Riddell: pong
[17:37] <Drakaen> any ideas what can be used... one person said samba but im not sure it will work
[17:37] <Jouva> Drakaen: http://www.fs-driver.org/  seems to be a potential good start
[17:37] <whoaitsphil> The test of the file system with type ext3 in partition #2 of SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) found uncorrected errors.   If you do not go back to the partitioning menu and correct these errors, the partition will be used as is.
[17:37] <RichiH> ^Elfboy: yah, you need to decide which to use, now
[17:37] <Invisible_Ubunti> I'm trying to find out how to install the GNOME theme manager where it shows up under System -> Preferences
[17:37] <LjL> Riddell: i've been trying
[17:37] <thatoldchestnut> hey. I'm trying to create a partition on my PC using gparted having booted off the ubuntu live cd, but each time I try to create it and it reaches the point where it says 'real resize', my PC freezes. any ideas?
[17:37] <bazhang> Riddell: same here
[17:37] <Riddell> danbhfive: what's your output for `md5sum /var/cache/flashplugin-nonfree/install_flash_player_9_linux.tar.gz`
[17:37] <whoaitsphil> and i click continue ayways and it says "AN error occured whil writing the changes to the storage devices. The resize operation is aborted.
[17:37] <Riddell> LjL, bazhang ^^
[17:38] <PriceChild> Riddell, 93b7c48eaa492237b807a3ae1de65cf9
[17:38] <Jouva> Drakaen: Well, let me double check something :) Are you speaking of a Linux partition on an HD that is in the same system as the windows machine?
[17:38] <danbhfive> Riddell: 93b7c48eaa492237b807a3ae1de65cf9  /var/cache/flashplugin-nonfree/install_flash_player_9_linux.tar.gz
[17:38] <drpcken> is there a way to backup my ubuntu install?  in case i re-install or something?  that way i don't have to reconfigure/redownload everything?
[17:38] <whoaitsphil> should i try changing it to ext2?
[17:38] <LjL> Riddell: 93b7c48eaa492237b807a3ae1de65cf9  /var/cache/flashplugin-nonfree/install_flash_player_9_linux.tar.gz

[17:39] <Riddell> bazhang: ah hah
[17:39] <danbhfive> !clono | drpcken
[17:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about clono - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[17:39] <LjL> Riddell: that's after manually removing the cached file, though
[17:39] <bazhang> uh oh
[17:39] <bobbob1016> I can't click anything in my system tray, or notification area.  I see the icons there, but if I right click one, the panel just acts as though it is blank space.  If I logout then back in, it works.  Any ideas?
[17:39] <PriceChild> drpcken, copy your /home to disk, and /msg ubotu clone
[17:39] <Catachan> mocoloco, thank you very much!
[17:39] <danbhfive> !clone | drpcken
[17:39] <ubotu> drpcken: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type <unconvertable> dpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages <unconvertable> , move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type <unconvertable> sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade <unconvertable> - See also !automate
[17:39] <PriceChild> Riddell, mine was after a fresh install.
[17:39] <Riddell> thanks others bazhang has what I'm looking for
[17:39] <mocoloco> np Catachan, that was driving me nuts for the longest time!
[17:40] <blackv1> Is anyone else having problems with flash after the last update?
[17:40] <drpcken> awesome!
[17:41] <blackv1> cause I can't view flash now
[17:41] <whoaitsphil> ok i have the partition editor up and all i have now is 32gb of windows XP on NTFS sda1...and then 47gb of unused space...how do i go about installing ubuntu on the rest of the 47 unused space in the manual partition editor?

[17:41] <dgjones> bazhang, I get the same 821cc.. as you
[17:41] <whoaitsphil> do i make it logical or primary, beginning or end?
[17:41] <shaz> hi
[17:41] <bazhang> dgjones: aha mine is now broken ;[
[17:42] <Jouva> Drakaen: Basically, if the Linux HD is in another system that can be booted while you're in Windows on another machine, then yes, use Samba or SCP/SFTP. If it's NOT then you CAN'T use samba because you can't boot both OSes at the same time without some sort of special software. In this case just use the ext2/ext3 driver
[17:42] <danbhfive> blackv1: whats the output of this command: ls ~/.mozilla/plugins
[17:42] <blackv1>  No such file or directory
[17:42] <thatoldchestnut> sorry to repeat myself. I'm trying to create a partition on my PC using gparted having booted off the ubuntu live cd (so that I can dual boot), but each time I try to create it and it reaches the point where it says 'real resize', my PC freezes. any ideas?
[17:43] <kercyr> I'm looking for advice about wireless adapter for an 7.10 install.  Searching seems to indicate it's a pretty spotty part in Linux's hardware support.   Are there any sure bets?
[17:43] <blackv1> worked fine until I ran an update for flash this morning
[17:43] <danbhfive> blackv1: how about this command: locate libflashplayer.so
[17:43] <dgjones> Riddell, I also have 821cc72359a937caef85bb4cc74ef5cd  /var/cache/flashplugin-nonfree/install_flash_player_9_linux.tar.gz
[17:43] <blackv1> now it says it's not installed?
[17:43] <Fratm> Anyone notice the latest 7.10 updates broke flash?
[17:43] <kercyr> I had some problems with flash this mroning too.
[17:43] <Invisible_Ubunti> I'm trying to find out how to install the GNOME theme manager where it shows up under System -> Preferences
[17:43] <Fratm> (i guess so)
[17:44] <kercyr> but removing and reinstalling fixed it.
[17:44] <blackv1> danbhfive: nothing
[17:44] <LjL> Fratm, blackv1: i think you should try <unconvertable> sudo apt-get --purge remove flashplugin-nonfree ; sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree <unconvertable>
[17:44] <mocoloco> blackv1, is it maybe related to this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3929669
[17:45] <whoaitsphil> i'm dual booting XP and ubuntu...on the manual partition setup for ubuntu should i make the partition primary or logical and beginning or end and what should i set as mount point? i already have XP installed
[17:45] <bobbob1016> thatoldchestnut: Is it resizing an NTFS drive?  If so, did you shut down Windows correctly?  NTFS-3G, which gparted uses to the best of my knowledge, requires a clean shut-down.
[17:45] <mocoloco> Invisible_Ubunti, you can change themes under System -> Preferences -> Appearance.  Does that have what you need?
[17:46] <NoOneImportant> how do I use ladspa?
[17:46] <Fratm> LjL, that worked.
[17:46] <bwf> whoaitsphil: make one partition for ubuntu your primary partition and define the mount point as root, then have a logical partition as your swap
[17:46] <AnAnt> Hello, how can I edit the Applications menu ?
[17:46] <Invisible_Ubunti> mocoloco, Yes, all the pages i've read tell me to do it the other way
[17:47] <thatoldchestnut> bobbob1016: yes, it's NTFS, which I understand linux doesn't like very much anyway. as far as I know windows shut down correctly, I restarted my computer properly and made it boot off the CD in the BIOS
[17:47] <whoaitsphil> should i set them both at the end of the partition?
=== Veinor is now known as Veinor|away
[17:47] <LjL> !away > Veinor|away    (Veinor|away, see the private message from Ubotu)
[17:47] <AnAnt> I find launchers that don't exist in /usr/share/applications/
[17:47] <bastid_raZor> are there any issues with ntfs-3g ? aptitude put the latest release on hold for some reason
[17:47] <blackv1> LjL: thanks! that fixed it :)
[17:47] <mocoloco> Invisible, that's probably because the appearance section is new in ubuntu 7.10
[17:47] <bobbob1016> whoaitsphil: That depends on a number of things.  I'll explain the difference, and you can figure out what you want.  To the best of my knowledge, there can only be 4 primary partitions, a logical acts as one primary, but can have many partitions inside it.
[17:48] <BabyDoll> my livecd doesnt wanna boot anymore :( wtf
[17:48] <LjL> bobbob1016: no, an *extended* acts as a primary, and an extended can contain logical partitions
[17:48] <bwf> whoaitsphil: the primary partion should not be part of any other partition but stand alone.
[17:48] <bobbob1016> thatoldchestnut: That is all I can help with, I don't know what would cause your issue, apart from not having a clean shutdown.
[17:48] <mocoloco> AnAnt, just right-click on applications and click "Edit Menus"
[17:48] <thatoldchestnut> rightio. don't worry, no one else seems to know either haha
[17:49] <sixstorm> why does linux have to suck with the newest hardware?
[17:49] <bobbob1016> whoaitsphil: Sorry, I was mistaken, Ljl corrected me, replace logical with extended in my response.  Sorry, I'm in class atm.
[17:50] <mocoloco> sixstrom, the answer is it doesn't have to :)  if companies made linux drivers as quickly as for Windows there wouldn't be issues
=== bwf is now known as Nuclear
[17:50] <bobbob1016> sixstorm: Depends on what new hardware you mean.  But the answer would be that companies don't make drivers for new things, and the drivers have to be made by outside people for linux.
[17:50] <whoaitsphil> thanks...i think i've got it working...i think my windows xp partition might be screwed up though
[17:50] <sixstorm> mocoloco:  yeah i understand that.  ubuntu just doesn't wanna fully work with my 8800GT
[17:51] <bastid_raZor> whoaitsphil; everytime i've done any tweaking of a primary partition with windows i've 'always' had to put the windows cd in and do a restore.. windows tosses system files all over a partition

[17:51] <hon> sixstorm: you stepped on the "nvidia driver can of worms". you can keep checking phoronix and such
[17:51] <whoaitsphil> do a restore? or a repair?
[17:51] <sixstorm> hon:  ;)
[17:51] <bastid_raZor> whoaitsphil; repair..
[17:52] <whoaitsphil> ah ok
[17:52] <kercyr> If you have any advice about wireless adapters (pci or usb) on ubuntu, please let me know.  Thanks.  I'm going to go work on other things...
[17:52] <whoaitsphil> so i will still have everything?
[17:52] <bobbob1016> sixstorm: The better phrasing would be your 8800GT doesn't want to work with Ubuntu.  nvidia drivers are usually good though, once they support the hardware with their driver.
[17:52] <bastid_raZor> whoaitsphil; basically all it done was remove the system files at the end of the partition. everything worked fine just had to put those files back on the partition
[17:52] <whoaitsphil> cool, thanks
[17:53] <sixstorm> bobbob:  yeah, i know.  i just remember having a slighty older PC and ubuntu would just FLY and be 100% functional
[17:53] <Nuclear> whoaitsphil: you will have to reinstall your applications as your registry will be reset to its original state
[17:53] <sixstorm> but with a Q6600 and 8800GT, it's just not all that fantastic
[17:53] <Nuclear> whoaitsphil: but the data on the partition should remain intact
[17:53] <bobbob1016> sixstorm: Yeah, that is because the drivers have to be made by hand basically.
[17:53] <whoaitsphil> k...will i be able to copy stuff from my windows partition to my ubuntu?
[17:53] <AnAnt> mocoloco: thans
[17:53] <bastid_raZor> Nuclear; whoaitsphil i've not seen it to extent.
[17:53] <hon> sixstorm: good news is that there is an nvidia driver being written paid by novell.
[17:53] <AnAnt> mocoloco: thanks
[17:53] <^punisher> sup?
[17:53] <^punisher> good
[17:53] <bastid_raZor> that
[17:54] <sixstorm> hon:  sweet!
[17:54] <BabyDoll> how can i get my dell wireless 1390 card to work
[17:54] <hon> once that lands, well, things won't suck so much.
[17:54] <Nuclear> bastid_raZor: pardon?
[17:54] <bazhang> BabyDoll: open up a terminal and type lspci
[17:55] <[revamped]> how to get special effects more than default ones ?
[17:55] <bastid_raZor> Nuclear; i've done several computers that way and have never had to reinstall apps after doing a repair.
[17:55] <bazhang> install ccsm [revamped]
[17:55] <TtyS2> trying to alter fstab to mount a share on my lan, whats wrong  //172.16.200.100/W	/mnt/w	smb	user,rw,auto,exec	0	0
[17:55] <BabyDoll> k next?
[17:55] <bardyr> how can i do a speed test on a raid?
[17:55] <bazhang> BabyDoll: that meant for me?
[17:55] <BabyDoll> ya
[17:55] <[revamped]> bazhang are you sure its for desktop effects ?
[17:56] <bazhang> [revamped]: heh, yeah pretty sure ;]
[17:56] <TKingdom> So I used Envy to install the latest ATI drivers, but in the Restricted Drivers Manager it says "In use" but Enabled isn't clicked.  This is normal, correct?
[17:56] <[revamped]> okay bazhang , any command line ? :$
[17:56] <thatoldchestnut> is EXT3 the best option use when installing ubuntu? as opposed to NTFS.
[17:56] <Nuclear> bastid_raZor: I see, I've noticed that it restores the registry to a previous point before. Nevermind then ;-)
[17:57] <sp> thatoldchestnut: installing GNU/Linux (which includes Ubuntu) on NTFS is not going to work out, believe me
[17:57] <thatoldchestnut> haha
[17:57] <thatoldchestnut> right
[17:57] <thatoldchestnut> maybe that's why it freezes when I try to do the partition
[17:57] <sp> thatoldchestnut: you could use reiserfs or xfs, but ext3 is the de-facto standard
[17:57] <bazhang> [revamped]: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-gnome (emerald if you wish as well)
[17:57] <bastid_raZor> Nuclear; possibly i hadn't installed any new apps in windows to the previous registry point it restored to. i'm sure it isn't impossible to happen with windows
[17:57] <[revamped]> thanks bazhang
[17:58] <sp> thatoldchestnut: should not be the reason for that, really, sounds like a bug, but installing on NTFS is not going to work as I said
[17:58] <thatoldchestnut> mind you, I did try to make the unallocated space into EXT3 when I was trying to make the partition then, and it still froze up
[17:58] <Zodiac`> a friend of mine can have both output and input in ALSA, and it works nice.. but Wine only shows output.. (means he cant talk in mic while using alsa, and OSS isnt an option when playing)
[17:58] <Nuclear> bastid_raZor: nothing is...
[17:58] <bazhang> [revamped]: no worries ;]
[17:58] <BabyDoll> at the very end i see network controller: broadcom Corporation BMC94311MCG wlan
[17:58] <TKingdom> bazhang: any idea why Compiz stopped working after I did 'dist-upgrade' and restarted?
[17:58] <BabyDoll> but im running off livecd to see if it would see my card
[17:59] <thatoldchestnut> sp: a bug with my computer, or with the software? I heard there's an 'alternate' version of ubuntu I can try to download instead, I don't know whether that's wrong or not
[17:59] <Aloha> what would cause my wireless connection to hang for awhile and then start going again after awhile?
[17:59] <bazhang> TKingdom: that was from feisty?
[17:59] <TKingdom> gutsy
[17:59] <sp> thatoldchestnut: maybe a software bug, but why do you want to create a NTFS partition anyways?
[18:00] <sp> thatoldchestnut: if you plan on creating a dual-boot environment you should install the other operating system first anyways
[18:00] <bazhang> BabyDoll: if you want to get someone's attention best to use their nickname--you can type the first three or so letters and then hit the tab key
[18:00] <bazhang> TKingdom: gutsy to hardy?
[18:00] <thatoldchestnut> sp: well my drive is NTFS to begin with and I run win xp on here, I only recently found out that linux doesn't get along with NTFS
[18:00] <BabyDoll> sorry bazhang
[18:00] <BabyDoll> bazhang at the very end i see network controller: broadcom Corporation BMC94311MCG wlan
[18:01] <thatoldchestnut> sp: so the other OS (windows) has already been installed
[18:01] <merike_> Hello, what could cause CUPS to stop working? It simply states that the job is complete even though it doesn't print.
[18:01] <TKingdom> bazhang:  A friend of mine told me to run 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade', I guess I'm not familiar with what that does exactly.  But compiz was working fine until I ran that and then restarted..
[18:01] <sp> thatoldchestnut: well, you cannot install (or should not) GNU/Linux on an NTFS partition, however, reading and writing should work fine
[18:01] <bazhang> BabyDoll: though I dont have that card--there are two options that both work for ubuntu and that card the broadcom fw cutter iirc
[18:01] <white_eagle> !flash
[18:01] <ubotu> To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash (for !Dapper and !Edgy, a recent version is available in !backports) - See also !Restricted and !Gnash
[18:01] <white_eagle> is the flash problem fixed for sure?
[18:02] <sp> thatoldchestnut: if you are trying to resize an NTFS partition make sure you defragmented that partition first
[18:02] <white_eagle> !flashissues
[18:02] <ubotu> The Flash plugin installation has been broken for some time. A fix has been released now, although it might not have yet reached all mirrors. If the update fails to install Flash, try <unconvertable> sudo apt-get --purge remove flashplugin-nonfree ; sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree <unconvertable>

[18:02] <neverblue> guys, having an issue with postfix-doc, when I do my morning updates, it seems to give me an error, I have tried to do aptitude remove, yet I get the error: ' Removing postfix-doc ...postconf: fatal: open /etc/postfix/main.cf for reading: No such file or directory dpkg: error processing postfix-doc (--remove): subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit status 1' what can I do resolve this ?
[18:02] <white_eagle> thank god!!
[18:02] <sunseeker888> HI guys need some advice. I am planning to buy a 500 GB external drive to back up my files on from windows. Can I partition, it, so that i can back up ubuntu documents
[18:02] <white_eagle> I was bored with gnash
[18:02] <BabyDoll> bazhang: when i try to enable the firmware it said something about that cutter lol
[18:02] <TKingdom> sunseeker888:  Try Gparted
[18:02] <BabyDoll> bazhang: where can i get it so i can install ubuntu on my lappy?
[18:03] <Zodiac`> a friend of mine can have both output and input in ALSA, and it works nice.. but Wine only shows output.. (means he cant talk in mic while using alsa, and OSS isnt an option when playing)
[18:03] <sunseeker888> Thanks Tkingdom, can ubuntu see my files mp3 on usb, do i need to use same?
[18:03] <sunseeker888> samba
[18:03] <Ketsuban> Does anyone have any experience with kasumi (dictionary for use with SCIM and Anthy) not adding words to the dictionary when converting to kanji?
[18:04] <whoaitsphil> sweet, got ubuntu installed and windows xp is still working fine...thanks everyone
[18:04] <danbhfive> TKingdom: lsb_release -a                 what's that say?
[18:04] <psycholvlan> are ubuntu's d/l servers down
[18:05] <white_eagle> psycholvlan, why that?
[18:05] <rfu> :o
[18:05] <bazhang> BabyDoll: that would be in the restricted drivers--piece of cake really
[18:05] <genii> psycholvlan: Nope, I just did an apt-get update to see
[18:05] <psycholvlan> trying to get some programs and can't connect to us.archive.ubuntu.com
[18:05] <thatoldchestnut> sp: yep, so last night I downloaded a stand-alone version of gparted and booted off that, and was able to set it so that the half of my HDD with windows was NTFS, and the half I intended to install ubuntu on was EXT3. it got me a little further than before, but crashed once again
[18:05] <bobbob1016> My notification area seems broken, I can't bring up any menu's on it.  For example, I can't click the "update" icon on it.  Any ideas on a fix?
[18:05] <BabyDoll> bazhang: i tried to enable it and it wouldnt let me
[18:06] <TKingdom> danbhfive: sorry, couldn't tell ya
[18:06] <sp> thatoldchestnut: when exactly does the installer crash? you shouldn't touch the NTFS partition at all from within the installer
[18:06] <bazhang> BabyDoll: this is in the livecd?
[18:06] <genii> psycholvlan: Though I am using canadian repo not US
[18:06] <BabyDoll> yes bazhang
[18:06] <BabyDoll> want me to install first?
=== a3p is now known as a7p
[18:06] <white_eagle> my friend has problems with his usb flash drive 4 gigs, it doesn't get recognized on ubuntu
[18:06] <psycholvlan> that could be the case
[18:06] <white_eagle> it is an JetFlashV30
[18:07] <danbhfive> TKingdom: why not?  whast the codename?
[18:07] <psycholvlan> just did the sudo apt-get update and it went through all the servers but stopped at the us.archive.ubuntu.com
[18:07] <white_eagle> he just hops it in and it doesn't get recognized
[18:07] <bazhang> Ketsuban: not sure about that though I do use kanji scim
[18:07] <TKingdom> danbhfive: Any particular reason you want to know?
[18:07] <ibou> I tryed to install compiz. i lost my windows borders although i installed emerald and executed emerald --replace. Here is the console message after a compiz --replace : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55110/
[18:07] <white_eagle> it is ofcourse recognisable in windows
[18:07] <sp> white_eagle: that sounds weird... USB flash drives usually work in a very specific way that is the same for all flash drives, so you should not be experiencing this problem
[18:07] <danbhfive> TKingdom: because of your earlier question
[18:07] <Itaku> i need help getting my sound working
[18:08] <white_eagle> it is my friend sp
[18:08] <danbhfive> TKingdom: if you don't need help still, then nvm
[18:08] <sp> white_eagle: any chance it does have some sort of encryption support or anything else "non-standard"?
[18:08] <TKingdom> Haha sorry, it's early.
[18:08] <neverblue> Itaku, did you try 'alsamixer', its a terminal command ?
[18:08] <thatoldchestnut> sp: it crashed after I'd manually selected in the installer which 'half' (the EXT3 half) I wanted ubuntu to go on. I pressed forward to start it, and it froze after about five or ten seconds
[18:08] <Ketsuban> bazhang: do you have any words in the Kasumi dictionary?
[18:08] <sp> white_eagle: also, what does the output of "lsusb -v" tell you about that drive?
[18:08] <TKingdom> lsb_release -a
[18:08] <bazhang> BabyDoll: well the main thing is that your card is fairly well supported under ubuntu--the fact that there are drivers and it is recognized are big steps--getting it work will require a little work though
[18:08] <TKingdom> oops..
[18:08] <Itaku> no
[18:08] <TKingdom> danbhfive:
[18:08] <sp> thatoldchestnut: okay, you might want to download the alternative install CD
[18:09] <bazhang> Ketsuban: is that from the repos? the kasumi dictionary?
[18:09] <Cpudan80> Hey
[18:09] <TKingdom> No LSB modules are available.
[18:09] <Cpudan80> Is there something wrong with Flash?

[18:09] <bazhang> Cpudan80: no more!

[18:09] <Cpudan80> bazhang: Hrm -- but it wont work in Firefox...
[18:09] <BabyDoll> hey bazhang: im installing now
[18:09] <Ketsuban> bazhang: yes.
[18:09] <danbhfive> TKingdom: ok ok, well, it looks like you are still running gutsy
[18:09] <psycholvlan> it there a way to connect to other servers... like canada's?

[18:09] <ubotu> Itaku: As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say (use !tab), or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
[18:10] <bazhang> Cpudan80: right same here---though now the issue is well on its way to your mirror--I mean the fix not the issue haha
[18:10] <Itaku> .
[18:10] <merike_> someone willing to help with CUPS?
[18:10] <Itaku> it was at you...
[18:10] <Pici> me?
[18:10] <bazhang> Ketsuban: just a moment let me install it
[18:10] <genii> psycholvlan: just chang us.archive.ubuntu.com in the sources.list to ca.archive.ubuntu.com
[18:10] <danbhfive> TKingdom: Here is a command to check your installation, that you can try,  it shouldn't hurt anything, unless you are really custom with your install
[18:10] <thatoldchestnut> sp: rightio, cool. that's not the LTS one, is it? or the one for serves?
[18:10] <Itaku> neverblue i dont know what my sound cord is though
[18:10] <PanzerMKZ_> psycholvlan what you mean connect to other servers?
[18:10] <psycholvlan> where i find the sources list
[18:10] <danbhfive> TKingdom: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^
[18:10] <neverblue> Itaku, use alsamixer
[18:10] <psycholvlan> i'm new to linux
[18:10] <Itaku> i did
=== Kwitschibo_ is now known as Kwitschibo
[18:11] <thatoldchestnut> sorry, typo. sp: rightio, cool. that's not the LTS one, is it? or the one for servers?*
[18:11] <Itaku> neverblue i dont know which one my speakers are
[18:11] <psycholvlan> i mean connect to other servers... my us.archive.ubuntu.com is down for me
[18:11] <sp> thatoldchestnut: there should be an alternate install CD for the LTS version too iirc
[18:11] <neverblue> Itaku, try each of them then
[18:11] <sp> thatoldchestnut: but no, that is not the server version
[18:11] <TKingdom> danbhfive: Don't I already have that/
[18:11] <Pici> psycholvlan: System>Administration>Software Sources, pick a different mirror
[18:11] <psycholvlan> ok thanks
[18:11] <genii> psycholvlan: You need to edit the file with admin privelege.So:  alt-f2   then:  gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[18:11] <Cpudan80> Pici bazhang -- Fix from ubotu works great, thanks
[18:11] <neverblue> Itaku, does your hardware work, the sound card, the speakers, headphones, etc ?
[18:11] <danbhfive> TKingdom: the ^ changes it, make sure to include the ^
[18:12] <genii> psycholvlan: Or use Pici's suggestion :)
[18:12] <TKingdom> Okay, its going
[18:12] <Itaku> neverblue it does
[18:12] <neverblue> Itaku, then change settings in alsamixer should fix your issues
[18:12] <cellofellow> I got a new version of flash in update-manager. Is this one safe?
[18:12] <bazhang> Cpudan80: yes! no problem ;]
[18:12] <D0pamine> does anyone know if there is an alsaconf in a package somewhere
[18:12] <Itaku> again
[18:12] <Itaku> neverblue i dont know which one my speakers are
[18:12] <D0pamine> i got a soundcard that needs re-configuring
[18:13] <Itaku> i tried al of them
[18:13] <bazhang> Ketsuban: it works here--what exactly is the error you get?
[18:13] <Ketsuban> bazhang: no error, just that I don't get more than one entry in the dictionary added to the list when entering something.
[18:13] <Itaku> neverblu do i need to be in reltek or NVidia?
[18:13] <neverblue> Itaku, as I said before, try all the settings
[18:13] <TKingdom> danbhfive:  Now I know why you mentioned custom install.  It's reinstalling stuff like Evolution, Totem and Rhythmbox
[18:13] <marx2k_> D0pamine: try alsa-utils
[18:14] <TKingdom> What now?
[18:14] <Ketsuban> bazhang: add <unconvertable> = <unconvertable> and <unconvertable> = <unconvertable> to the dictionary, then try and type them.
[18:14] <marx2k_> !alsa-utils
[18:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about alsa-utils - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi

[18:14] <pteague> is the flash plugin really fixed?
[18:14] <glguy> I gave a friend running Ubuntu some fonts to add to his ~/.fonts, but his computer doesn't see the bitmapped fonts after restart (it does see the ttf ones). He has to manually type xset +fp ~/.fonts
[18:14] <Itaku> how do i change that setting?
[18:14] <neverblue> Itaku, lspci will tell you which audio card you have (* do NOT paste the output from that command in the channel*)
[18:14]  * cellofellow has same question as pteauge
[18:14] <danbhfive> TKingdom: That command goes through and double checks that everything from ubuntu-desktop is actually installed
[18:14] <glguy> What do you set so  that yo udon't have to manually add those fonts to the path every time??
[18:14] <D0pamine> thanks marx2k_
[18:14] <thatoldchestnut> sp: is the alternate version of ubuntu essentially the same as the normal one? I can't quite seem to see a link anywhere to download it
[18:14] <maximilion> Hmm, vlc worked perfectly for a while, now won't play a single movie file! (perfect audio, pink garbage instead of video)

[18:15] <danbhfive> TKingdom: I figured that it might help ya, that if you had the full install, maybe it will fix something

[18:21] <cellofellow> pteague: I just upgraded and it broke. :(
[18:21] <pteague> doh
[18:21] <BabyDoll> bazhang: copying files 27% done
[18:21] <maximilion> tuxfusion: Aha. Well, this is the Ubuntu channel, so I assumed you meant Gnome in Ubuntu :)
[18:21] <bazhang> cellofellow: it broke for me earlier today as well--the mirrors have the new fix now though!
[18:22] <cellofellow> bazhang: but, I just installed the newest version. :/
[18:22] <bazhang> cellofellow: or will shortly ;]
[18:22] <thatoldchestnut> does anyone know whether the alternate version of ubuntu for the desktop PC follows the same procedure when installing as the normal one, and is it unable to do anything the normal one can?
[18:22] <cellofellow> bazhang: should I meander over to archive.ubuntu.com instead of using the easynews mirror for now?
[18:22] <bazhang> cellofellow: I did as well--the broken and fixed versions two hours apart haha
[18:22] <pteague> cellofellow> last time i ended up just downloading the file & running the installer... i think the problem is adobe keeps changing the file breaking the md5sum
[18:23] <tuxfusion> maximilion, yes strange there is no GNOME channel nor a openbox channel , fluxbox guy are freaks the yscred me away , and cause i think itz some basic GNOME/GTK thing ( i t looks like th standard meatacitya ani) i thougt id finally find a solution =)
[18:23] <DRebellion> thatoldchestnut: the alternate installer uses a text only install method (no install gui). However, the installed distrubution is just as capable as the normal livecd installed.

[18:26] <TKingdom> thatoldchestnut:  I used the alternate version it has the proper options for you to easily get through the installation.
[18:26] <DRebellion> dan__: yes. set up the folder as 'shared' (on windows) and mount the share on linux.
[18:26] <thatoldchestnut> cool, thanks. I shall give it a go
[18:26] <thatoldchestnut> thanks all for your help
[18:26] <bazhang> BabyDoll: what did you do after it hung at 27%?
[18:27] <BabyDoll> it gave me an error then stopped
[18:27] <stephans> does anyone know why sound in (microphone) would wver stop working?
[18:27] <bobbob1016> My notification area seems broken, I can't bring up any menu's on it.  For example, I can't click the "update" icon on it.  Any ideas on a fix?
[18:27] <orochi_> stephans: I have no idea, but I have an intel hda based chipset and in 7.10 the volume on the microphone goes down on every boot
[18:28] <MrBL> my perfect laptop installation doesn't suspend after closing screen since I"m
[18:28] <orochi_> To get it to work I have to switch the microphone source from line in, then back to microphone :>
[18:28] <bazhang> BabyDoll: is this adsl?
[18:28] <MrBL> (I'm using 2.6.22-14-generic)
[18:28] <BabyDoll> ya bell is dsl
[18:28] <Pici> bobbob1016: Have you tried removing and re-adding the notification area?
[18:28] <gtt> i'm getting a new hard drive today, and it out-spec's the hard drive currently holding my OS. Assuming it would be a performance improvement to move the OS to the new drive, what is the best way to copy the entire OS entact to the new drive with the minimum amount of time and labor?
[18:29] <bobbob1016> Pici: Yeah, a few times
[18:29] <bazhang> BabyDoll: well you can try again with the livecd, or try the alternate cd if that chokes again
[18:29] <Pici> bobbob1016: Does anything else on the notification area work?
[18:29] <gtt> MrBL: I just solved that problem (2 hours ago) by using Envy to upgrade my ndivida drivers.
[18:29] <sidelil> Excuse me, I have a dual boot machine, ubuntu + vista. Is it possible to run the installed vista in a virtual machine under ubuntu? Thank you.
[18:29] <maximilion> Is there a Mac Panther type theme?
[18:30] <BabyDoll> bazhang: the alt cd? what u mean lol
[18:30] <x1sc0> how can I install pygtk in ubuntu ?
[18:30] <Pici> !themes > maximilion (Please see the private messsage from ubotu)
[18:30] <gtt> MrBL: see bug 180907 at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/180907
[18:30] <bobbob1016> Pici: No, programs in the notification area don't, my battery percentage isn't shown, and network-manager doesn't list wifi available.  I can change the volume, and see the calendar though.
[18:30] <danbhfive> gtt: maybe you could do a fresh install, then copy over /home, and take a look at /msg ubotu !clone
[18:30] <MrBL> gtt: didn't think that NVidia would screw up. I'll give it a try right now, thx!
[18:30] <bobbob1016> Pici: The shutdown button works too.
[18:30] <maximilion> Pici: Lovely, thanks! :)
[18:31] <bazhang> BabyDoll: first lets try the livecd once more then we can discuss other options ;]
[18:31] <Deeppact> Hello everyone
[18:31] <BabyDoll> bazhang: im already trying it lol
[18:31] <JoshJ> wow this is ridiculous, i'm having some weird issue trying to install on a comp with an ATI radeon HD 2400
[18:31] <gtt> danbhfive: i forgot to mention, reinstalling the OS was my least favorite option (my /home is on a separate partition, so it's not that bad of an ordeal) because i just did it a week ago.
[18:31] <BabyDoll> its scanning files
[18:31] <JoshJ> basically it defaulted to 1024x768 resolution, i tried to change it to 1440 x 900 but it's glitching out and now i can't even get into X :/
[18:31] <gtt> it might be the quickest option for me though.
[18:32] <bazhang> BabyDoll: new to linux?
[18:32] <JoshJ> is there a way to reset my desktop settings?
[18:32] <zlaja> uhm im new on my linux
[18:32] <bobbob1016> Pici: The battery icon changes as I unplug/plug in the power cord, and the Update Manager tells me if I have to reboot, after installing updates via synaptic.
[18:32] <BabyDoll> bazhang: just ubuntu lol im use to gentoo and freebsd lol
[18:33] <zlaja> dont know how to use it :S

[18:33] <dan__> i am able to navigate to music files in file browser, but i am having trouble reading those files from the music playre itself
[18:34] <JoshJ> it WAS working a minute ago until i tried to  change resolution
[18:34] <bobbob1016> JoshJ: Did you install the ATI driver?  I think you need it for ATI X1xxx and up.  How did you change your resolution, via gui or terminal?
[18:34] <JoshJ> i just need to know how to reset the resolution via command line
[18:34] <dan__> do i need ot have an entry in fstab for the smb share?
[18:34] <JoshJ> via gui
[18:34] <bazhang> BabyDoll: then it might be an issue with the cd itself--either the iso is corrupted, the media is faulty. or the burn speed was too fast
[18:34] <BabyDoll> bazhang: it stopped again lol
[18:34] <tuxfusion> cellofellow,maximilion it was an OpenBox animation , disabled it with obconfig , thx guys !
[18:34] <BabyDoll> i burned it probally too fast lol
[18:34] <JoshJ> system-administration-graphics and screen or something
[18:34] <bobbob1016> Pici: What do you mean?  If I click n-m, it used to show me available wifi, it won't anymore, that is what is happening with everything there.
[18:34] <Dimitree> Why when i completely remove a package from Synaptic and then try to install a newer version of the same app, it says that an older version is detected in a channel ??? how to completely remove apps ?
[18:35] <bazhang> BabyDoll: you should first check the md5 sum to be sure the iso is not corrupted, also try burning at a very slow speed
[18:35] <pepperjack> JoshJ: gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf  scroll to near the bottom usually its the depth 24 settings it will try them from greatest to least

[18:35] <JoshJ> k thanks
[18:35] <Pici> bobbob1016: What version of Ubuntu are you running?
[18:35] <gtt> JoshJ: which monitor is it?
[18:35] <JoshJ> though i guess it'll be nano instead :P
[18:35] <JoshJ> gtt: some dell monitor
[18:36] <JoshJ> i have like 20 modelines, could that be the problem?
[18:36] <Arelis> Hi all. I have a rar file here i'd like to extract, and it is passworded and i know the password, but every time at the end of the extraction it deletes the file and asks me the password again, after it copies the file all over again! Can anybody help me solve this?
[18:36] <gtt> the sheer number of modelines is unlikely a problem
[18:37] <bobbob1016> JoshJ: Open a terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal) and type "cd /etc/X11/" then type "ls" without the quotes, if you see "xorg.conf" with a date or backup or something behind it, it should mean you have a backup, if you just copy the backup over the current one, it should bring you back to what it was at.
[18:37] <JoshJ> ah, Dell SE198WF is what xorg.conf has
[18:37] <bobbob1016> Pici: Gutsy
[18:37] <JoshJ> bobbob1016: k, lemme check for a backup
[18:37] <maximilion> !flash
[18:37] <ubotu> To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash (for !Dapper and !Edgy, a recent version is available in !backports) - See also !Restricted and !Gnash
[18:37] <JoshJ> yeah
[18:37] <gtt> I've also had ok luck with renaming it, and letting xorg generate a new one.. if you're on gutsy or higher it should work
[18:37] <maximilion> !gnash
[18:37] <ubotu> An open source flash replacement.  It is still beta software. For current status or for more info http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/
[18:38] <gtt> and since xorg's able to identify your monitor, that's a good shot too.
[18:38] <bullgard4> "detlef@MD97600:~$ LANG=C apropos recurse; recurse: nothing appropriate." Where can one find a manpage for this Samba command?
[18:38] <JoshJ> gtt: fair enough, but the default install it didn't get widescreen :/
[18:38] <white_eagle> hey what was that command for the usb again?
[18:38] <bobbob1016> JoshJ: You should still use envy as suggested above.  If that doesn't work, do "cd /etc/X11/" then "mv xorg.conf xorg.conf-broken" then "mv xorg.conf(most recent backup) xorg.conf"
[18:39] <white_eagle> please repeat it
[18:39] <white_eagle> whoever said it to me
[18:39] <smultron> has anyone gotten Pidgin to connect to iChat Server running on Mac OS X Server?
[18:39] <JoshJ> bobbob1016: hang on, i'm going to restart, give me the envy thing when i get back ok?
[18:39] <bobbob1016> JoshJ: You might need to do "sudo" before the last two commands, not sure.
[18:39] <bobbob1016> JoshJ I won't be here
[18:39] <JoshJ> since i just tried to reset the X stuff
[18:39] <bazhang> smultron: probably the wrong channel for that
[18:39] <Arelis> Hi all. I have a rar file here i'd like to extract, and it is passworded and i know the password, but every time at the end of the extraction it deletes the file and asks me the password again, after it copies the file all over again! Can anybody help me solve this?
[18:39] <JoshJ> yeah, i did the xorg.conf stuff in tty2 already
[18:39] <JoshJ> brb
[18:40] <smultron> bazhang: already tried #pidgin

[18:40] <white_eagle> my friend has problems with his usb flash drive 4 gigs, it doesn't get recognized on ubuntu
[18:40] <gtt> JoshJ: probably true...I experienced something similar on my va1912wb, after you enable the restricted driver (or use envy) your proper display mode should return
[18:40] <gtt> dangit
[18:40] <white_eagle> please repeat that command
[18:40] <white_eagle> someone told it to me, and I haven't wrote it somewhere

[18:42] <NoOneImportant> is ubuntu-minimal a meta package?
[18:42] <JoshJ> right, it's working now in that i have a nonwidescreen GUI now
[18:42] <vicky_> can some tell me how to delete a installation of ubuntu
[18:42] <bobbob1016> JoshJ: Someone will show you how to get envy, I have to go now.
[18:42] <LjL> vicky_: just overwrite it with something else.
[18:42] <JoshJ> system-administration-screens and graphics; now what do i set this monitor as?
[18:42] <JoshJ> or do i actually *need* envy to get widescreen?
[18:42] <vicky_> i try that
[18:43] <Pici> JoshJ: Envy isn't supported here, so I dont think anyone is going to be helping you get it.
[18:43] <vicky_> it did not work
[18:43] <gtt> you dont have to have envy for widescreen
[18:43] <LjL> !doesn't work | vicky_
[18:43] <ubotu> vicky_: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.

[18:45] <vicky_> ubuntu 7.10, metest86*
[18:45] <LjL> vicky_, if you have two installations in two different partitions, and you want to get rid of one of them, and free the space, that won't be easy. you will certainly need to backup your data.
[18:46] <LjL> !gparted > vicky_    (vicky_, see the private message from Ubotu)
[18:46] <gtt> white_eagle,sidelil:  the trick is to convert the vista partition into a vmware virtual machine using the vmware convertor
[18:46] <vicky_> i know that for sure
[18:47] <vicky_> tell how i can format my hard drive and i just reload it
[18:47] <tobias_> Hey ubuntu people. I'm following this howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox , but on "sudo module-assistant auto-install virtualbox-ose" I get the error message saying "Bad luck, your kernel headers were not found" or something like that. I try to follow the hints in that message, but without succes. What could I do?
[18:47] <gtt> it'll take time and hard drive space, but it worked very well for me.
[18:47] <LjL> vicky_: format the whole drive? the Ubuntu installer will give you that option.
[18:47] <bob__> hi, i'm looking for a C or C++ IDE
[18:47] <sidelil> gtt: ok. I use VirtualBox, but I can install vmware if needed. Can you suggest me a guide or something like this? Is it something difficult?
[18:48] <vicky_> i did that. that how come i end up like this
[18:48] <gtt> i used a separate FAT32 partition to store the created vmware image
[18:48] <vicky_> i try it once more
[18:48] <vicky_> hope it work
[18:48] <bob__> hi, i'm looking for a C or C++ IDE, anyone knows a good one with all the essential tools?
[18:48] <vicky_> i dont know what i was doing wrong
[18:49] <CSABA> im having trouble installing the gtk developer libraries, can somebody help me?
[18:49] <bazhang> sidelil: vmware-server is in the gutsy canonical partner repos and is very easy to install--once you have downloaded it you need to go to vmware.com and get the free key
[18:49] <maximilion> Anyone got Gnash working in Youtube etc on their AMD64 PC?
[18:49] <vicky_> anyway i try once more
[18:49] <CSABA> i need to install pango, but pango requires libpng
[18:49] <LjL> tobias_: try <unconvertable> sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) <unconvertable>
[18:49] <gtt> sidelil: virtual box should work too, but if it doesnt have a convertor of its own (dont remember seeing one) you can use the vmware convertor... there's a guide on howtoforge for using the convertor.
[18:49] <CSABA> and libpng cannot be compiled because it has errors
[18:49] <CSABA> so what to do?
[18:49] <rinaldi_> hi why is it that with some fullscreen games I can still see the top and bottom menu bars?
[18:49] <tobias_> LjL, it says there is no installable candidate
[18:49] <bazhang> maximilion: not sure about gnash--but flash is working once again--should be in a mirror near you soon
[18:49] <vicky_> also can i set up a remote access VPN with ubuntu
[18:49] <bob__> hi, i'm looking for a C or C++ IDE, anyone knows a good one with all the essential tools?
[18:50] <maximilion> OK, worth waiting for then?
[18:50] <CSABA> bob: eclipse?
[18:50] <LjL> CSABA: why would you need to *compile* libpng?
[18:50] <sidelil> bazhang, gtt: thank you both!
[18:50] <bazhang> maximilion: yesh!
[18:50] <macogw> bob__: eclipse can do c and c++

[18:50] <bazhang> np
[18:50] <macogw> bob__: written in java but has plugins for tons others

[18:50] <LjL> CSABA: sudo apt-get install libpng3 libpng12-0?
[18:50] <maximilion> And why is Ubufox needed?
[18:51] <bob__> so i can just get it trough synaptic or apt-get?
[18:51] <CSABA> thanks ill try that
[18:51] <cellofellow> maximilion: just exta features

[18:51] <maximilion> ah.

[18:51] <LjL> tobias_: the package name being?
[18:51] <Flatulento_joe> or
[18:51] <bazhang> maximilion: sooper sekrit partnership with ubuntu (sshhh!)
=== Flatulento_joe is now known as Loco_aullador
[18:51] <tobias> tobias_: yo :)
[18:51] <gtt> sidelil : unfortunately i know of know thorough guide...though you will probably be able to figure it out... free up a bunch of space and remove everything you can from the vista install. shrink your vista partition as small as you can. create a separate fat32 partition that's big enough to accomodate the vmware image, and then use the vmware convertor.
[18:51] <bob__> eclipse and its c plugin is available trough synapstic or apt-get?
[18:52] <tobias_> LjL, linux-headers-2.6.20-15-386
[18:52] <CSABA> bob: no download it from eclipse's site, search on google
[18:52] <LjL> tobias_: uh, what ubuntu version are you on
[18:52] <tobias_> LjL: feisty
[18:52] <bob__> so it's a tar.gz archive?
[18:53] <maximilion> So I won't need Ubufox when the proper Flash plugin comes?
[18:53] <CSABA> bob: yes but if you unpack it you can just double-click on the eclipse file and it will start
[18:53] <LjL> tobias_: why do you have the 386 kernel installed rather than the generic?
[18:53] <CSABA> and then download the c++ plugin and copy it into the eclipse directory
[18:53] <tobias_> LjL, no idea, I do choose generic in grub
[18:53] <gtt> have you considered Kdevelop instead?
[18:53] <gtt> of Eclipse?
[18:53] <LjL> tobias_: well but if uname -r says 386, it means it's 386 that is running. anyway, pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list please
[18:53] <bob__> oh ok
[18:54] <tobias_> LjL, right, on it
[18:54] <bob__> kdevelop? never heard of it

[18:54] <d90_> hey guys all my devices attached to usbs are not working (external hd, scaner, printer, bluetooth, cardreader, camrea, same when I attach memory stick)

[19:06] <maximilion> OK, I have Ubuntu running with nvidia (6800 generic) drivers. HW accel is there, and only a few bugs (exiting a 3D game makes the resolution 1024x768, Blender always starts fullscreen despite me starting it windowed, that kind of thing...)

[19:06] <Tailsfan> Because I heard it was free and legal
[19:06] <nemilar> Nuclear: 7.10 comes with compiz-fusion installed
[19:06] <taz> i found it
[19:06] <bazhang> taz that is the nv driver or the nvidia driver
[19:06] <maximilion> Should I bother to install drivers from nvidia.com, or am I asking for trouble? :)
[19:07] <tobias_> LjL, okay, im back now starting it
[19:07] <Nuclear> nemilar: how do I enable it? I can start the configuration and set the options, but it just doesn't 'load'
[19:07] <taz> with ctrl and alt  then click arrow it show
[19:07] <LjL> maximilion: the latter
[19:07] <taz> it work now

[19:22] <Slart> taz: what mail-client do you use?
[19:22] <LiraNuna> theacolyte: I run 650i, works out of the box
[19:22] <usr13> taz: What email client are you using?
[19:22] <bazhang> maximilion: for compiz, or just generally?
[19:22] <LucidDr34m3r> Anybody able to give me a hand with my laptop battery issue? It was working after install...
[19:22] <taz> home.. just normal
[19:22] <CVD-PR> Dante is this what you want? Dante
[19:22] <protcront> java channel doesnt exist at all or why i cannot be able to connect it
[19:22] <CVD-PR> http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=5303
[19:23] <Tobias92> LjL, hey, its me again, im in .22 and its fine as far as I can tell
[19:23] <Slart> taz: normal? thunderbird? evolution?
[19:23] <theacolyte> LiraNuna: interesting, although the 780 chipset is a little different -- I went to install ubuntu last night x64 7.10 on my new build and the disk boots into a blank screen
[19:23] <Dante> I think so
[19:23] <taz> firefox
[19:23] <LjL> Tobias92: now try again installing the headers, <unconvertable> sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) <unconvertable> , then go on with the vbox setup. you can remove the old kernels, if the new one works - <unconvertable> dpkg -l | grep linux-image <unconvertable> , and remove everything except for 2.6.22-14-generic
[19:23] <usr13> taz: Are you using web based mail server?
[19:23] <LiraNuna> theacolyte, let me guess, 8800GT?
[19:23] <Dante> I just write install 'compizconfig-settings-manager?
[19:23] <taz> what do u mean?
[19:23] <theacolyte> LiraNuna: heh, yeah, in SLI
[19:23] <usr13> taz: Using your web browser to access mail?
[19:23] <Slart> taz: firefox is a browser.. are you using webmail of some kind? hotmail?
[19:23] <maximilion> I can manage without all effects -it's stylish with smaller icons that I'm after. Main thing is I don't install a bunch of graphical "tasks" that might mess up my not-perfect nvidia driver :)
[19:23] <Tobias92> LjL, thanks :)
[19:23] <theacolyte> LiraNuna: to be honest I didn't have any time to troubleshoot at all, any ideas?
[19:23] <maximilion> Hm, that was directed to bazhang.
[19:23] <LiraNuna> theacolyte, use the laternate CD - 8800GT is too new
[19:23] <taz> att/sbc
[19:24] <usr13> taz: What email software on your PC?
[19:24] <LiraNuna> theacolyte, or use alt-F1 during splash to run in VESA
[19:24] <bazhang> dante prefaced with sudo apt-get install of course--and add compiz-gnome and emerald if you wish
[19:24] <taz> pop
[19:24] <theacolyte> LiraNuna: nice, thanks a bunch... so I install it via the alternate, Im assuming it uses some sort of VESA Mode and then I install NVIDIA's drivers?
[19:24] <usr13> taz: Are you using Thunderbird?
[19:24] <LiraNuna> theacolyte, I got 8800GT running in SLI too, the drivers are too old to recognize 8800GT
[19:24] <maximilion> But I'm open minded if you can give me an example of must-have compiz effects bazhang :)
[19:24] <taz> evloution mail
[19:24] <bastid_raZor> any current issues with ntfs-3g? aptitude has it held back.
[19:24] <xalastras> my router keeps on updating my dns and erases my isp's dns.. how can i block my router from doing that or.. keep my isp's dns always on?
[19:25] <maximilion> Blow me away!
[19:25] <LiraNuna> theacolyte, VESA is a VGA driver - noo HW accel
[19:25] <michalski> i have gnome right now as the desktop environment, if i install KDE (kde-desktop) will i be able to remove it if i dont like it? and how would i?
[19:25] <Dante> Bazhang: I have both of those already I see. But when I try to take something other than None it says "Composite extension is not available"
[19:25] <theacolyte> LiraNuna: so the process is install alternate w/ VESA, install official NVIDIA drivers?
[19:25] <usr13> taz:  Very good.  Now if someone here has experience with evolution, they should be able to help you.
[19:25] <bazhang> maximilion: there are tons at gnome look dot org (com?)
[19:25] <JoshJ> michalski: you could? just sudo apt-get remove kde-desktop
[19:25] <usr13> taz: What is your language?
[19:25] <debasys> i am trying to configure a wireless data card...at the end after editing wvdial.conf and making sudo wvdial it says 'modem is busy'
[19:25] <bazhang> dante then it is the driver that needs to be 3d
[19:25] <JoshJ> michalski: you can choose which one you want on boot anyway
[19:25] <taz> american
[19:25] <LiraNuna> theacolyte, or use the normal liveCD and press Alt+F1 during splash to switch to VESA
[19:25] <LucidDr34m3r> Anybody able to give me a hand? My laptop battery isn't getting recognized by Gutsy anymore...
[19:25] <taz> usa
[19:25] <michalski> joshj: realy how would i chose on boot?
[19:26] <theacolyte> LiraNuna: ah didn't know you could do that iwth the normal CD
[19:26] <maximilion> bazhang: That's exactly my problem... it great! But I'm pretty new to this and I'd like to go on recommendations by seasoned veterans ;)
[19:26] <JoshJ> in the options thing on the login window
[19:26] <maximilion> I have absolutely no idea which theme requires a lot of other modules etc
[19:26] <Dante> bazhang: I used the resricted driver manager to install my ATI Xpress 200M card.
[19:26] <usr13> taz: You should see options for text-only or somethingl like that... change that option.
[19:26] <michalski> joshj: ahhhh ok thanks, so if i ever want to remove it i just remove the kde-desktop package?
[19:26] <jmedina> hi there
[19:26] <YouKnowMe> I had flash, I install an update that fixed the "flash-installer" and now FF says I don't have flash and need to install it, but then tells me its already installed.. Help?
[19:26] <bazhang> maximilion: well this seasoned veteran (ha! one year plus) has kde, so best to ask the gnome people here ;]
[19:26] <dan__> does ububntu have 32 bit emulation? and where could i find t epackages etc?
[19:26] <Pici> !flashissues > YouKnowMe (Please see the private messsage from ubotu)
[19:27] <taz> where i can find ?
[19:27] <jmedina> is there any way too see which packages do I have installed from a specific repository?
[19:27] <Dante> bazhang: Tuxracer seems to work fine so I dont think that I am missing 3d drivers? Or is there something im missing?
[19:27] <theacolyte> LiraNuna: but it *does* work with 8800GT's in SLI?
[19:27] <jmedina> for example I want to list all the packages I have installed from multiverse
[19:27] <michalski> ok thank you
[19:27] <Slart> YouKnowMe: sudo apt-get remove --purge flashplugin-nonfree   then reinstall it using firefox
[19:27] <LiraNuna> theacolyte, yes
[19:27] <bazhang> dante that should be good then--not sure have you asked in the compiz channel?
[19:27] <JoshJ> Slart: when i just installed it via firefox, it did it with the packge manager
[19:27] <crdlb> Dante: you must use Xgl with that driver
[19:27] <JoshJ> Slart: just a FYI
[19:27] <hyde> wezcie sie
[19:28] <maximilion> Well, there's GTK, Beryl, compiz as you say, Gnome, X11...
[19:28] <usr13> taz: You will just have to fish around in the preferences.  I don't know for sure.  I'm not an evolution user. (I am hoping an evolution user will jump in here and give you specific information.)
[19:28] <bazhang> dante and now the experts weigh in ;]
[19:28] <neverblue> guys, having an issue with postfix-doc, when I do my morning updates, it seems to give me an error, I have tried to do aptitude remove, yet I get the error: ' Removing postfix-doc ...postconf: fatal: open /etc/postfix/main.cf for reading: No such file or directory dpkg: error processing postfix-doc (--remove): subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit status 1' what can I do resolve this ?

[19:29] <taz> user13   which u using for mail  thundermail or other ?
[19:29] <crdlb> Dante: you need to install xserver-xgl
[19:29] <LiraNuna> theacolyte, just google for installing the latest nvidia drivers
[19:29] <Dante> crdlb: Is that the xgl thing you are talking about?
[19:29] <LiraNuna> I hope they will include them in 8.04
[19:29] <Catachan> Does any one know anything about changing the logo at the top left corner of the desktop to one of my own choosing?
[19:30] <Dante> crdlb: And I just write sudo wep-get install xserver-xgl?
[19:30] <crdlb> Dante: the ATI driver does not support the things needed to run compiz, so you must install xserver-xgl, which is essenitally an abstraction layer
[19:30] <Slart> JoshJ: yes.. firefox runs apt or something.. I'm just not sure it works the same when you run if from apt alone.. any way.. that was the way I did it and it worked =)
[19:30] <Dante> crdlb: Nice can I do that in add/remove?
[19:30] <crdlb> Dante: sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl
[19:30] <taz> i founddd ittt
[19:31] <crdlb> and yes, you could use that
[19:31] <usr13> taz: I just use the browser, (Firefox) and access webmail online.  (gmail).  But my wife uses Thunderbird and works fine for here. (I am her sysop and find Thunderbird fairly user friendly / simple to use.)
[19:31] <LucidDr34m3r> Would anyone be able to give me a hand with a laptop battery issue I'm having?
[19:31] <Dante> crdlb: And do I need to configure something after installation?

[19:39] <m0u5e> zil2: type in the computer name / IP address like this <computername>/c$
[19:39] <m0u5e> zil2: it will access the root share (it will prompt for user name & pass)
[19:39] <zil2> ok, I will try that now
[19:39] <zil2> but... I am concerned that ftp is not working :( but there is always another day for that
[19:39] <Catachan> Does any one know anything about changing the logo at the top left corner of the desktop to one of my own choosing?
