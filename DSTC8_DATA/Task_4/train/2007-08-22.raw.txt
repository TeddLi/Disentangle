[06:33] <t0nedef> Hello David
[06:33] <CBiLL> zeeble : does installer create the best partation and swap on the drive? or I have to do that myself?
[06:33] <Travo> thanks!
[06:33] <kahrytan> Polygon89, That explains why my downloads are so slow.
[06:33] <CBiLL> I wonder if it create swap or something
[06:33] <CarlFK> Andrew250:  then man dd.  doubt you will find dd docs on ubuntu.com
[06:33] <t0nedef> I learned a lot before that place existed, but that place still has lots i don't know yet
[06:33] <tigran> My internet (wifi) is really unstable. Its connected to the router (via wifi) but most of the time I have no interne
[06:33] <Polygon89> kahrytan, yeah, people who use comcast now cant seed, but i can still download torrents at full speed, must be a diff problem.
[06:33] <zeeble> CBiLL: well, it can create, but i have never allowed it to do anything. i do it manually
[06:34] <CBiLL> well I am newbie and I was told all I need to do is pop in cd and follow step
[06:34] <CarlFK> CBiLL: yes, unless you think you know whats best,
[06:34] <kahrytan> Polygon89, You and others should dump comcast.

[06:34] <CBiLL> I did went with defaults but seem to be giving me issues
[06:34] <Polygon89> kahrytan, no can do. the only other isp around for cable is quest, and they are much worse (i had them before comcast)

[06:59] <tigran> bulmer: its not that i cant, its that i cant at times, most of the time
[06:59] <bucky> h1st0, terminal is showing my drives almost correctly, I think the problem is partition manager doesnt support EXT 3
[06:59] <CarlFK> Andrew250: I was, but changed my mind when I saw what was avalible.  the .img would let you have other files on the same drive, but not be as easy to work with
[06:59] <tigran> bulmer: ping and traceroute work
[06:59] <bucky> so I'm going to reformat the drive

[07:01] <bulmer> or rx 100% all the time either
[07:01] <lazaruslupine> yeah
[07:01] <CarlFK> Andrew250: partitions are just the results of a few bytes near the beginnning of the drive that point to the start/size/type of each partition.  whack those bytes and you whack the partition _table_
[07:01] <bucky> h1st0, I started ubuntu and began the installation process, I didn't realize I needed a swap partition (this is after I formatted the free space I had unallocated with EXT 3). I then used partition manager in DOS to make a new 1gb partition. I don't think partition manager supports EXT 3 which is why the free space showed up as unallocated when it was EXT 3. I still was able to make a 1gb partition, but now the ubuntu installer do
[07:01] <jeremyc_> Hey guys..
[07:02] <Andrew250> CarlFK: yea I get that
[07:02] <playerzen> lazaruslupine: then I have to do killall -9 kdm
[07:02] <tigran> bulmer: but its probably 10% up time
[07:02] <bucky> I'm going to start fresh now.
[07:02] <Andrew250> CarlFK: I understand the idea of an mbr
[07:02] <CarlFK> Andrew250:  so the copy will have the same junk
[07:02] <kousotu> tonyyarusso, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34617/
[07:02] <m0u5e> bucky: use gparted to make a swap partition
[07:02] <Johnuah> Pelo:  tnks a lot
[07:02] <lazaruslupine> if you do ctrl-alt-f1 to switch to a console and then startx from there it should be more verbose playerzen
[07:02] <bulmer> tigran: so, dont use wifi, use wired
[07:02] <h1st0> bucky: why don't you just delete the partitions and leave free space and allow the ubuntu installer to do this for your.

[07:02] <bucky> The ubuntu installer can make a swap partition? I saw no option for that
[07:02] <bulmer> tigran:  or get a better network system :)
[07:03] <Andrew250> ok
[07:03] <bucky> Will gparted work without booting into DOS?
[07:03] <tigran> bulmer: lol, so you think it can be from my router?

[07:10] <ubot3> smartking: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)

[07:31] <chasetoys> wolferine, actually nvidia-settings doesnt show a resoltuion higher than 1280x1024 now
[07:32] <wolferine> (i am assuming the second monitor is the only one having the issue)

[07:32] <wolferine> chasetoys, what did you do before the second monitor settings changed, reboot, downloaded something, installed something, or what?

[07:35] <yigal> chasetoys: very easy under X Server Display Configuration select Auto for resolution and then on the bottom "Save to X Configuration File"
[07:35] <Andrew250> so it's not doing anything right.  I thougth the hd would make more noise.
[07:35] <Andrew250> ok sorry
[07:35] <abelfaec> thanks though flannel, i want to try it out.
