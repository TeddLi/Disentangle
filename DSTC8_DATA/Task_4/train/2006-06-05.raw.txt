[10:55] <guestie> answerguy thanks for your help but im going to have to tackle this some other time, something tells me its too late for me to be tinkering
[10:55] <skipmeister> orbin, not work means I can't get 1680x1050 res. The best I can manage is 1400x1050. Also couldn't get 3D acceleration working
[10:55] <Schalken> avis. i just dont want to install it. boot up ubuntu and find no drviers for it work and it is using dreaded Mesa software rendering again. that would be HELL. or boot up a video game and find OpenGL doesnt work. or some OpenGL feature doesnt work or something like that. so... does anything with the 5200FX not work with the nVidia drivers?
[10:55] <bulltitan> trying kubuntu today,... tomorrow god knows what i will try

[11:21] <James-C> Question: My /etc/hostname on a Ubuntu server keeps resetting (on any reboot) to have contents of "127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain" So then anything that is based on /etc/hostname (like prompts, login, uname, etc.) keep coming out as 127 or 127.0.0.1 instead of the machine's name.  Doesn't seem to affect anything it is running, but a bit disconcerting. Manually doing 'sudo hostname machinename' fixes until next reboot. :-( Suggestions?

[12:37] <bjmg> On the website https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue1 you can read that there are updates for epihany-browser and other packages (section Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Updates). But they are not available on the mirrors (at least not in binary form). The source packages do exist.
[12:38] <holycow> avis, *nod*, okay that is actually already installed *nod*

[12:39] <holycow> Toma-, yeah, they worked just before the dist-upgrade infact with last weeks beta.  the weird thing is this  upgrade seems to have updated the kernel, i had to fix nvidia manually and its probably interfering with sound now too

[12:40] <avis> ubuntuforums.org is awesome.  it gets so much traffic my posts get outdated pretty quick with the new dapper release.  no one replies !
[12:41] <avis> but to some quetions they wont be ignored
[12:41] <holycow> protocol1, well i managed to make the speakers squeal by checking the wrong input box while i had another cardin to test ... i'll try th eother port again, but this one looks green to me ...
[12:41] <Toma-> holycow: im guessing you might have had a modified /etc/modules/aliases file, and the dist-upgrade hasnt installed all the new aliases.
[12:41] <avis> mine was a query for best gnome apps that are unknown
[12:41] <skippy81> i find that the forums arnt good for really technical stuff

After 6 times a message shows in text mode (very wired characters),...
[12:43] <ubuntuNewbee> ...that tells me that "The display server has been shut down about 6 times in the last 90 seconds. I is likely that something bad is going on. Waiting for 2 minutes before trying again on display :0". After 2 minutes nothing happens.

[12:54] <avis> guillem101, look at this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=131267 it saved my life
[12:54] <delire> dennis_: anyway, i'll do it here. fix 1) login into the text only console and try the following. first 'chmod 777 ~/.ICEauthority'. then go back to the gnome login screen with CTRL-ALT-F7 and try to login

[12:58] <Guardian> avis: i have currently have a multiboot and i'm afraid desktop cd won't let me choose on which partition to install and wether or not grub should be placed on the mbr
[12:58] <steve_> Morrowyn: thanks
[12:58] <Morrowyn> under gnome, in kde i think its somewhere in the control center
[12:58] <liquidindian> liquidindian, oh, okay:  I'm sorry.

[12:58] <rixxon> what do i use to convert some .ogg to .mp3?
[12:58] <Ng> Guardian: the alternative install disc is probably the best way to go
