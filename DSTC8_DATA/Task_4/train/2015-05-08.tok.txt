<s> hey everyone , a friend of mine is periodically getting crashes in which he gets errors like this when trying to run commands : " bash : DIR/usr/ DIR/bin/ <unk#a/:> input/output error " or " bash : DIR/bin/ DIR/ls/ : no such file or directory " . we think that it is a issue with the drive , but it is brand new . is there any reason apart from drive failure which could cause these type of problems ? </s>
<s> <user> : no </s>
<s> <user> : can you run the above command , then ? </s>
<s> ok , i 'll have a look how that works . thanks for your help , <user> ! </s>
<s> <user> , it appears the issue is with the software center , but not when using apt-get .. you may want to update and upgrade there first also . </s>
<s> if i 'm on live test what i download is saved .. like library ? </s>
<s> <user> : no , you have to copy things to your windows drive </s>
<s> good </s>
<s> so it 's like deep freeze the live test ? </s>
<s> it runs in ram so on reboot everything is gone </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> so when i said " sudo apt-get install pastebinit " that program is only installed in ram temporarily </s>
<s> <user> : what do you mean update and upgrade there first . you mean update and upgrade my ubuntu installation frop apt-get ? </s>
<s> <user> : so , if you run " sudo parted -l " and share it via URL/http:/ URL/paste.ubuntu.com/ we can see if your sd card is being detected or not </s>
<s> <user> , open a terminal : ctrl+alt+t .. then ; sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade </s>
<s> <user> : im checking this : URL/http:/ URL/askubuntu.com/ <unk#a-/> </s>
<s> query : it appears an upgrade on our old laptop running trusty knocked the b43 driver out of sync with the bcm4311 firmware , and i 'm having trouble figuring out how to get the firmware updated . any pointers from <unka-> people ? </s>
<s> <user> : lspci -vvv might also be useful </s>
<s> oh right , ubuntu , with sudo of course </s>
<s> <user> , after you upgrade , try the sw center again . </s>
<s> <user> : best to start simple and just run my suggestion rather than jump straight into assumptions that it 's not even supported </s>
<s> <user> : have no fear , walk through the path <user> points out </s>
<s> <user> , rebooting first ? </s>
<s> walk gently brother </s>

<s> how can i enable tun </s>
<s> <user> , ok , i do n't know what else to suggest here . clearly there is still an issue with the sw center . at least you can install via apt get . </s>
<s> <user> : what did you run to upgrade ? that apt-get upgrade ? that just updates the packages you have in </s>
<s> ! upgrade </s>
<s> for upgrading , see the instructions at URL/https:/ URL/help.ubuntu.com/ URL/community/upgradenotes/ - see also URL/http:/ URL/www.ubuntu.com/ URL/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade/ </s>
<s> sudo update-manager -d </s>
<s> <user> , i ran the commands <user> suggested : apt-get update and afterwards upgrade </s>

<s> it will not take you to the next version </s>
<s> ! info <unka> </s>

<s> <user> : ? </s>
<s> yeah , read back through history , there 's allot to the issue . </s>
<s> <user> : install <unka-> </s>

<s> </s>

<s> " he ca n't " </s>
<s> <user> : nah -d is for development release upgrade , i think - so not wise </s>
<s> <user> , untill the <unka-> bug is resolved , yes , use apt-get to install sw </s>

<s> <user> , not a good idea to mix an match managers like that ( synaptic , aptitude , apt-get ), long discussion , but suffice it to say , it can end in tears . </s>
<s> <user> : do you have an ubuntu support question ? </s>
<s> <user> : you can use whatever name you like in general </s>
<s> most of us obfuscate our real names , but you are under no obligation to do so </s>
<s> <user> swap that user 's initials around </s>
<s> <user> : lets have that discussion </s>

<s> do n't feed the troll :) </s>
<s> synaptic , aptitude , apt-get can be used <unka> </s>
<s> <user> , but he has n't </s>
<s> so , i do n't see the problem atm </s>
<s> i would like to build guis in ubuntu </s>
<s> is qt the only solution ? </s>
<s> <user> : also do n't go showing ppl your id , it 's the internets </s>
<s> oh thanks , i thought we can trust people here </s>
<s> <user> : no , there is wx , qt , tkinter </s>
<s> <user> , there are more gui toolkits available , e.g . gtk2 </s>
<s> what 's the easiest to use ? </s>
<s> i do n't trust my cousins , much less <unka> . trust is earned </s>
<s> <unka> </s>
<s> is n't <unka> for windows ? </s>
<s> <user> , aptitude and apt-get use the same repositories . but aptitude does not itself use apt-get apt-cache etc . this will lead to issues over the long term . </s>
<s> <user> : not really issues , no </s>
<s> they all use the same system installing things , and checking dpkg you will see the correct packages installed </s>
<s> <user> , it 's further <unka> by the use of dpkg which does not resolve dependencies . </s>
<s> <user> : which language are you using to program ? based on that the <unka> comes </s>
<s> if you try to trust the history of any given schema your methodology is at fault </s>
<s> <user> <user> one issue i 'm aware of is that if you install things with apt-get and then run aptitude , aptitude might tell you that those packages you just installed are unneeded </s>
<s> dpkg is a tool in this scenario to check what 's installed </s>

<s> <user> blowing smoke ? me ? </s>
<s> i 'm using ruby , javascript , and c </s>
<s> lol <user> </s>
<s> <user> , this not really a support issue , we should defer this to a later date channel as it 's fairly busy in here today . </s>
<s> oh him </s>
<s> <user> : if advice you give to ppl in this channel is based on this misguided assumption set , this is support related </s>
<s> aptitude and apt-get both use dpkg to actually install the packages . so the only possible issues would be with package selection </s>
<s> <user> , it 's not misguided at all . </s>
<s> <user> : check if wx , qt and tkinter have extensions for ruby , i have used python mostly and found wxpython to be easy </s>
<s> sounds pretty misguided to me </s>
<s> <user> thank </s>
<s> give me an example scenario where something bad happens </s>
<s> i 'll spin up a vm and run through it now </s>

<s> partition table : msdos </s>
<s> <user> that is the command you run to mount the sdhc ? </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> parted -l and i pasted parts </s>
<s> i know , but i still want to know how you mount that sdhc </s>
<s> hmm .. </s>
<s> i try mount -t drive folder and did n't work </s>
<s> im not familiar with these commands </s>
<s> mount -t drive folder just like that or are you missing " ntfs " ? </s>
<s> is there an ubuntu kernel or os that is solely dedicated to professional studio recording ? i have seen some but i am interested in someone who has actual experience with it . </s>
<s> but it is msdos </s>
<s> the partition table is msdos </s>
<s> my bad </s>
<s> it says type : disk </s>
<s> <user> , if you're looking for a <unka-> distribution i'd check distrowatch </s>
<s> thanks <user> . :) </s>
<s> <user> can you maybe paste the exact command you're using ? </s>
<s> <user> , ubuntu studio </s>
<s> hmm </s>
<s> because if the command gives you an error , chances are seeing the command might help us tell what is wrong , no ? </s>

<s> oh </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> are u sure ntfs and not fat32 ? </s>
<s> huh ? </s>
<s> i dont know what kind of file system you have on your <unka> </s>
<s> <unka*> </s>
<s> about mount -t ... hmm about lsblk i do n't see mount point </s>
<s> or why you'd insist on not letting it autodetect </s>
<s> maybe because it 's not mounted i guess . </s>
<s> autodetect is it even option ? </s>
<s> type just " mount " to see what is mounted </s>
<s> back again i see :) </s>
<s> yeah , autodetect is the default if you dont specify the type </s>
<s> <user> , lol </s>
<s> <user> is that an apt-get or an install ? drivers are important too . </s>
<s> <user> : you need to paste the partition lines </s>
<s> i.e . no " -t ntfs " or " -t fat32 " or anything </s>
<s> <user> : DIR/dev/ DIR/sda7/ on DIR/media/ DIR/ubuntu/ <unka/_> type fuseblk ( <unk#a,=_> ) maybe this </s>
<s> <user> , it 's a distro , however you could also install it over an ubuntu installation i believe ( it used to be the case , a few years back ) </s>
<s> i do n't know </s>
<s> i do n't know which is the sd card </s>
<s> ( as in , install it as packages ... not <unka> ubuntu ) </s>
<s> :) </s>
<s> <user> hmm , does the <unka_> sound familiar to you ? </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> well you could take a look at it with ls or something </s>
<s> there is nothing as recovery folder or distro </s>

<s> <user> : how did you connect from comcast ? </s>
<s> <user> so inspect them all with ls to see what they are </s>
<s> i assume you know what 's on your disks :) </s>
<s> <user> : what do you mean , i 'm sorry . </s>
<s> <user> , all that is included in ubuntu studio is free </s>
<s> <user> run " ls DIR/media/ DIR/ubuntu/ <unka/_> " </s>
<s> and they customized the kernel so it 's realtime </s>
<s> ( for latency sake ) </s>
<s> i did that already , thanks . it did n't help . in way that is not my driver </s>
<s> i have seen it before but was looking for open source studio stuff . </s>
<s> <user> , magic ? </s>
<s> <user> that line you just said made no sense . try again ? </s>
<s> <user> , please </s>
<s> is it proxy ? </s>
<s> <user> , most is opensource </s>
<s> <user> , never had any issues connecting . no proxy no nothing . i 'm just connecting from home </s>
<s> <user> : comcast is like something tv .. </s>
<s> proxies ... we used to have those here too , back in the 90s </s>
<s> i just do n't know </s>
<s> <user> , what are you having issues with ? </s>
<s> i have spent thousands of dollars on software with windows and the stupid advertisements and background resident programs running and talking with the manufacturers over the internet is garbage . </s>
<s> <user> : mount sd <unka/> ... in windows i just installed a driver </s>
<s> <user> : they are an isp for cable internet </s>
<s> that was come up to my mind but was n't find the correct words .. </s>
<s> <user> : you want to back up this card so you do n't even need to mount it :) </s>
<s> <unka> </s>
<s> what ? </s>
<s> windows garbage </s>
<s> i just want to backup the user folder so i can reinstall distro </s>
<s> ( raspbian ) </s>
<s> <unka> are from the dos era :p </s>
<s> okay , now it 's starting to make sense , <user> </s>
<s> ken is now known as <user> </s>
<s> <user> : a quick dd image backup makes sense to me </s>
<s> i 'm doing house <unka> now so i ca n't help </s>
<s> go mount it read-only and get it over with :) </s>
<s> plus <user> does n't run anything i say :d </s>
<s> i cant find the driver </s>
<s> you do n't need a driver </s>
<s> and you do n't need to mount it </s>
<s> for the love of tux will you please pay attention ;_ ; </s>
<s> i mean the <unka(> disc name ) </s>
<s> *drive </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> it told you in parted </s>
<s> so mount the windows disc , then use 'dd' to image up the drive </s>
<s> terminate stay resident still exists . just open up a command prompt and type in msconfig and see what is running in the background . </s>
<s> lol no <unka> what did u say </s>
<s> sorry windows disk </s>
<s> me neither ... i think he wants to image his sdhc card </s>
<s> not his windows disk </s>
<s> <user> : paste me the output of " sudo parted -l " in a private message then , because this is really beginning to frustrate me </s>
<s> <user> : yes but it needs to be saved somewhere </s>

<s> yes got error : error : DIR/dev/ DIR/mmcblk0/ : unrecognised disk label from your <unka(> parted -l ) </s>
<s> that does n't matter </s>
<s> so that 's the sd card then </s>
<s> i type mount and the drive </s>
<s> it 's loading .. :d </s>
<s> <user> : now you need to mount one of the ntfs windows partitions from DIR/dev/ DIR/sda/ for where to store the backup </s>
<s> <user> by that definition pretty much every application is a <unka> :) </s>
<s> <user> : argh you do n't . need . to mount . it . </s>
<s> i have windows8 folder already open .. </s>
<s> why <unk!?> </s>
<s> <user> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> because you ca n't backup multiple partitions that way </s>
<s> you mean i need to do something like cp folder to folder ? </s>
<s> no you do n't do that </s>
<s> you use an image writing program to dump the entire card to an image file </s>
<s> sorry i do n't understand you . </s>
<s> well what are you hoping to do with the mounted disk ? you ca n't just copy files </s>
<s> that is not a folder ? </s>
<s> <user> in a modern os ( i.e . not dos ), many processes can run at the same time . what you describe is actually the general case , not a special case ( <unka> ) </s>
<s> hi all </s>
<s> <user> : you ca n't just file copy an os as backup </s>
<s> <user> this is why we need to use that command to see what is running in the background . in fact there is a free software called : " what 's running " free and virus free and it shows everything running in windows . good tip . i am not sure if it is safe these days but it has always been a good free software . </s>

<s> " free and virus free " what </s>
<s> just use the task manager </s>
<s> thanks that was good link </s>
<s> or <unka> process explorer if you want to be thorough </s>
<s> <user> : but note you have to change it to be appropriate for your situation </s>
<s> on linux you would use top ( or better yet : htop ) instead </s>
