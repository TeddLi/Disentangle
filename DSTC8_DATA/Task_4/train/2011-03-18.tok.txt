<s> <user> , what should i use then ? </s>
<s> how do i become the new user <unka'> </s>

<s> <user> : i think ext2 is the best , or parse a option to ext4 to disable journaling , and i dont know how to do that xd </s>
<s> <user> , not for everyday use , of course ! but for trying linux out and doing recovery things ! </s>
<s> <user> , su dropbox </s>
<s> ! webmin | <user> </s>

<s> the only way to get rid of it is to restart </s>
<s> this is a new problem , started at 10.10 </s>
<s> any ideas ? </s>
<s> <user> , few other people are reporting the same issue - it 's most probably due to the video drivers </s>

<s> no , i have n't </s>
<s> <user> , the proprietary flash plugin uses some kind of weird acceleration that causes problems on certain drivers , you might want to try switching to some alternatives </s>
<s> what is this ? </s>
<s> <user> , for example , you might consider trying the proprietary drivers </s>
<s> <user> , oh , and really , what 's wrong with journaling ? </s>
<s> there is a way to disable hw accel though , i 'll look into it </s>

<s> <user> : try disabling hardware accel for flash first :d right click flash vid -> settings -> uncheck box for accel </s>
<s> i m first use it </s>
<s> <user> : so it will destroy your pendrive </s>
<s> <user> , i know what you mean , i run proprietary drivers as well - but your issue appears often when using the free ones </s>
<s> <user> : because pendrives are designed to support a limit of io cycles </s>
<s> <user> , cheers 2sec , i thought there was a cfg file somewhere to switch it on/off </s>
<s> where are u ? </s>

<s> <user> , you could try adding the dropbox user to your group - but why are you using a dedicated user for dropbox ? </s>
<s> <user> : i think it will become freeze </s>
<s> and you will cannot do anything , just <unka> </s>
<s> <user> thx </s>
<s> how do i check if a particular driver in question is bound to a device , and talking to the kernel ? </s>
<s> <user> : because i tried with my own user and it does funny things when i try to share DIR/home/ DIR/ubuntu/ to other dropbox users </s>

<s> that 's the way fuse woks i guess </s>
<s> <user> : so if it 's listed , then a driver should be installed ? </s>
<s> <user> , it will list the driver its using </s>
<s> <user> : it tries to sync DIR/home/ DIR/ubuntu/ <unka./> which has socket files and goes 100% cpu usage , if i exclude it , it <unka> it and my db disappears , if i recreate it , and then try to share DIR/home/ DIR/ubuntu/ it makes a <unka.> ( conflicted copy ) dir </s>
