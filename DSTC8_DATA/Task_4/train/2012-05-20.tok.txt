<s> <user> : depends on what <unka> you install . ;) </s>
<s> <unka> </s>
<s> sorry ... </s>
<s> i meant i want xfce with compiz . </s>
<s> <user> : while ubuntu and debian are technically very similar , the two projects have very different goals - and are thus " very different " , though technically similar ;) </s>
<s> imo ubuntu tends to " just work " and debian requires a little more effort . </s>
<s> why would you want xfce with compiz ? xfce has its own window manager . ;0 </s>
<s> <user> , you might prefer synaptic instead of software center ; it 's ( synaptic ) in the repos . </s>
<s> <user> , i want an environment that is customizable , but also has the option of being easy to work with if i have to get something done fast . </s>
<s> <user> : maybe , but i think it 's unlikely ... i 've tried yesterday and today , in very differnt hours </s>
<s> <user> : the servers have been problematic for 3+ days now </s>
<s> <user> , because i really like compiz , and xfce is the lightest window manager i could find . for example compiz does n't work on fluxbox . </s>
<s> ... and it worked in a live session i 've used yesterday </s>
<s> <user> : xfce is a desktop that uses the xfwm window manager . </s>
<s> <user> : fluxbox and compiz are both window managers ... </s>
<s> <user> : you can set up a compiz session to run whatever other extra programs you want and build your own desktop . </s>
<s> btw , i hear that gentoo has the best package repository . is it possible to use those packages in debian/ubuntu ? </s>
<s> <user> : 'best' is vague and <unka> . </s>
<s> <user> : they use a sourced based system . so its more up to date . but can still have problems . and no they are not compatable with ubuntu </s>
<s> <user> , it 's best not to mix packages between distros . there are small differences that can muck up the results ( e.g . different paths ). </s>
<s> <user> : and gentoo does n't typically use " packages " , it 's a source based distro </s>
<s> <user> : ubuntu minimal + fluxbox + slim comes in at about 1.2gb then you 'll need a network manager app like wicd if you want to use wifi easily </s>

<s> <user> , thanks . </s>
<s> <user> : compiz and lightweight are two very opposite things . :) </s>
<s> <user> : i 'm an ubuntu user since karmic ... synaptic is great if i want an in-depth tech details on a given package .... but i still would like software center to work properly , specially regarding sso </s>
<s> <user> : if you want light and a decently featured desktop = lubuntu , then <unka/> , </s>
<s> <user> , what 's the difference between ubuntu minimal and lubuntu ? </s>
<s> <user> : lightest = just a <unka> manager with no extra apps . ie openbox </s>
<s> <user> , but would compiz work on openbox ? </s>
<s> <user> : mini is the debian <unka-> ( text only ) - with lots of options , including installing a base non-gui system , then adding what you actually want . </s>
<s> <user> : minimal is just kernel + boot loader + drivers </s>
<s> hi guys </s>
<s> <user> : compiz and openbox are both window managers .. they replace each other . </s>
<s> <user> : plus a few basic apps , all text based </s>
<s> <user> : that does n't even make sense . one window manager does not work " on " another window manager . you ca n't run two at the same time . </s>
<s> <user> : linux is all about layers . ;) </s>
<s> desktop = a window manager + extra apps . </s>
<s> <user> : ha , that 's a good one :) </s>
<s> besides , the new revamped software center is one of the major , key ubuntu selling points ... so it is a bit weird that instead of trying to help with it , you are suggesting a 10+ years software . </s>
<s> <user> : <unka> adds an x server , lxde , openbox and some applications like web browser , office productivity etc </s>

<s> you can add deb <unka./:> <unka$> main restricted universe multiverse et al to the top of your DIR/etc/ DIR/apt/ DIR/sources.list/ and it will find the closest best it can </s>
<s> even aptitude has an experimental gtk frontend </s>
<s> replacing <unka$> with your distribution . </s>
<s> is there a specific make or model for hybrid tv cards that runs on ubuntu with the least amount of wrestling ? </s>
<s> <user> , as you so accurately stated earlier , it 's all about choices . :) </s>
<s> okay ... look , i 'm a novice . i want to install something that is bare-bones but has the potential to be customized to the point of being easy to use . ( which also means that i want the possibility of using binary packages as opposed to bare-bones gentoo .) since this is an ubuntu chatroom , i figured it would be a good place to get advice about ubuntu-related distros . ultimately , after some </s>
<s> customization , i want an ubuntu-like environment . but i would also like to be bare-bones and customizable and for it to have a very good repository of packages . </s>
<s> i 'm better off posting about my gedit + ftp problem in the ubuntu forums right ? </s>
<s> <user> : use the minimal ubuntu setup , simple as that -- install only things you want from that point on </s>
<s> yay i finally managed to transfer all my stuff to ubuntu </s>
<s> <user> : install ubuntu minimal then install fluxbox , its as <unka> a desktop as it goes </s>
<s> <user> , thanks . </s>
<s> so for me synaptics is a weak software ... it is less friendly than sc , it has no reviews , and it has less features than aptitude or apt-get </s>
<s> <user> : did say that earlier ... </s>
<s> this channel is for tech support of ubuntu . asking whether or not you should install other distributions is not its purpose <user> . your queries are going to <unka> arbitrary answers and they are clogging up the channel . try ubuntu-offtopic or bots . </s>
