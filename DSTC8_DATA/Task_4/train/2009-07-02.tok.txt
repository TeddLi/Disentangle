<s> <user> : hmm i mean ,,,, pidgin cant connect to yahoo and the pidgin devs are aware and workin on it , its also an ubuntu bug ? </s>
<s> hi , can someone help me , since a <unka> ( i think it was one ) my system <unka'> start <unka> . </s>
<s> <user> : yes , but i wo n't ever go outside the package management </s>
<s> <user> : there needs to be a bug reported in launchpad ( against ubuntus pidgin ), because the fix for yahoo ( which is in <unk#.> ) needs to be put into 2.5.5 </s>
<s> <user> , how so ? </s>
<s> does it go into grub ? </s>
<s> hah , has any one ever done the alt+f2 free the fish command ( if you run gnome ) </s>
<s> <user> : URL/http:/ URL/tinyurl.com/ <unka-/> </s>
<s> yas , the <unka> is there and the caps lock and the scrool lock aer blinking . </s>
<s> thank you guys for trying to help , but i find all this to be too unnecessarily complicated </s>
<s> <user> : you're holding your oses to a double standard . but sure , if you wo n't go outside of package management , file a bug about it . there is n't currently one . </s>
<s> yes ... </s>
<s> <user> : or , switch to debian testing , which is a rolling release where they do n't freeze versions , so you're constantly being updated . </s>
<s> <user> : URL/http:/ URL/tinyurl.com/ <unka-/> </s>
<s> when you boot up hit alt+f2 and it will show you all the things going on behind the scenes ... see if you can pinpoint where it is going wrong based on the text output </s>
<s> hi i need some assistance with xorg - if i run startx my screen goes into sleep mode . any suggestions ? </s>
<s> i 'll go back to xp , since lack of yahoo connectivity is a showstopper for me ; it 's not a pidgin problem , they fixed it ; it 's an ubuntu issue </s>
<s> <user> : tried generating a new configuration file already ? </s>
<s> kernel panic - not syncing : fatal exception in interrupt . </s>
<s> <user> : bye </s>
<s> bye all </s>
<s> bye </s>
<s> anybody here any good at grub ? </s>
<s> aah wait </s>
<s> okay , guys , i would really like someone to help me install a plugin for pidgin ... my issue is that when configuring i do n't know where to point the installation to ... </s>
<s> nooo </s>
<s> it somehow seems to dislike the idea of booting an os on a disk marked as slave instead of master > _ > </s>
<s> <user> : is it asking for where the binary is ? </s>
<s> <user> : again , that 's not a launchpad bug report , ubuntu 's pidgin people need to be told about it , and i do n't believe they have been . </s>
<s> <user> : the binary of pidgin ? </s>
<s> <user> : whats ya prob </s>
<s> <user> : yeah where is it asking you to point to </s>
<s> i still cant get my computer to install ubuntu . it starts , gives me language select , gives me menu of " install " " demo " etc , if i hit either one it takes me to black screen with info about ubuntu and its software and has a <unka> prompt ... can someone help me ? </s>

<s> changing the jumper would take several hours cause of the way the hardware is fitted in the case </s>
<s> so that 's not really an option </s>
<s> bart , do you mind if i pvt you ? </s>
<s> the hd has both win xp and kubuntu on it ( i 'm happy i did n't try debian ) </s>
<s> now if i boot it 'll load grub </s>
<s> <user> : it was a popular problem or bug , and if you telling me that the devs will only fix a problem if you file a launchpad report , thats really arrogant , but i dont believe thats how they work . </s>
<s> the side issue being that it gives error 22 </s>
<s> <user> , at the first menu after the language try hitting f4 and selecting the safe graphics mode </s>
<s> <user> : it wont care if its master or slave , its the dev that it cares about , and you may need to install the grub onto the mbr if you have changes drives </s>
<s> <user> : purple is a library for pidgin , pidgin is installed to DIR/usr/ DIR/bin/ in my system </s>
<s> <user> , if it 's not that , you might have a bad disk ... did you check the disk for errors ? </s>
<s> well , the fact that it loads means it 's in the mbr <user> </s>
<s> <user> : but anyway ill file one if thats what it will take </s>
<s> hey is it possible to revert my kernel to an older version ? </s>
<s> <user> : you're saying that the people in charge of packaging pidgin need to be omniscient ? </s>
<s> <user> , =( </s>
<s> cause if it was booting directly from the slave it'd load xp </s>
<s> it wrote the mbr on one of the sata disks </s>
<s> <user> , when you but up you can select which kernel </s>
<s> ill go check that , i guess brb , whether it works or not </s>
