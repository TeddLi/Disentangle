<s> suspend is like being on standby and hibernate is like you going to sleep at night </s>
<s> but hibernate should also be possible with a swap file , right ? </s>
<s> short term basis = suspend , some data is kept in memory ( ram ) and hibernate gets <unka> written to harddisk or ssd </s>
<s> @ <user> , <unka> consumes more energy but wake up faster </s>
<s> <user> , try ask at lubuntu channel </s>
<s> that way i could decide later i want the space for other things and just wo n't use hibernate any more . </s>
<s> its best to shutdown your machine and save over all on your house electricity bill :) </s>
<s> <user> , does hibernate work with swap file rather than partition ? </s>
<s> <user> : afaik you ca n't use a swapfile with encrypted swap , but with encrypted swap you lose hibernate anyway </s>
<s> <user> , did you realize what i said ? </s>

<s> <user> , wait my partition is encrypted , then it wo n't work you say ? </s>

<s> <user> : forget that , my bad :) </s>

<s> lts </s>
<s> well if the swap partition has to be unencrypted i would n't do that anyway </s>
<s> <user> : no , unencrypted swap with an otherwise encrypted system is not good </s>

<s> <user> : choose manual partitioning </s>

<s> <user> , i can create disk encryption before installation . i 've done it with 14.04 and it worked fine . </s>
