<s> what is really odd is this is a fresh install </s>
<s> <user> , you want to disable amazon lens . thought there was a factoid .. </s>
<s> hmm , the slow copying speed is still there :( </s>
<s> and it works in the ubuntu test desktop </s>
<s> ! adlens | <user> </s>
<s> <user> : if you wish not to see " more suggestions " from places like amazon in your ubuntu 12.10 , simply remove the package unity-lens-shopping , or adjust your privacy settings as shown here : URL/http:/ URL/goo.gl/ URL/kfo4u/ . mark shuttleworth 's blog entry on this is at URL/http:/ URL/goo.gl/ URL/uf7zz/ </s>
<s> <user> , different drivers are active on live boot if i 'm not mistaken . some kind of generic " mouse driver " </s>
<s> <user> , thanks . </s>
<s> <user> : would n't that be like saying you ca n't ask about <unka> because this is n't bsd support ? </s>
<s> does unity work well with dual monitors ? </s>
<s> <user> , or logout , choose a different desktop environment and log in . </s>
<s> rsync is faster and more efficient than scp ove ssh via cli right ? </s>
<s> <user> : cmon </s>
<s> <user> , regardless this ain </s>
<s> <unka'> debian support . </s>
<s> <user> , so all i would need to do is change xorg.conf and set the file to use the generic driver </s>
<s> is there anyone who could help me with some openvpn issues ? </s>
<s> <user> : the upgrade process differs alot between debian and ubuntu . so ask the specific support </s>
<s> <user> , <unka> . start there </s>
<s> ! topic | <user> </s>
<s> <user> : please read the channel topic whenever you enter , as it contains important information . to view it at any time after joining , simply type DIR/topic/ </s>
<s> <unka> , i know linux , but this new ubuntu is really different and i have n't kept up </s>
<s> <user> , no worries . we're all learning . </s>
<s> <unka> , thanks for the info thought . </s>
<s> does unity work well with dual monitors ? </s>
<s> <user> , yes if you can get it working </s>
<s> <unk#.> gnome classic de ... i recently added a second monitor , no problems ... when i reboot , only the monitor without my panels is active ... the kludge i 've come up with is to right-click on desktop & choose " change desktop background " then click the " all settings " tab & then displays ... i then check " mirror displays " & apply ... the inactive monitor becomes active ... i then uncheck " mirror displays " and the second monitor remains ac </s>
<s> <unka> ... i 've googled and not found anything quite like this ... couls someone provide a more elegant solution ;- ) </s>
<s> <user> : there is no old desktop in <unka> </s>
<s> <unka*> </s>
<s> <user> : hm has it ever been faster ? </s>
<s> <user> , i think i figured this out . i 'm supposed to be using the <unk#a+> images </s>
<s> <user> : so you cant place dektop icons on your desktop etc . ( by default ) </s>
<s> <user> , i thought ubuntu did n't require me to get things working </s>
<s> <user> , dern details ! </s>
<s> <user> : yeah , after 12.10 for like one day , then i installed new rams , then it 's super slow now </s>
<s> <user> , but i should have asked ... </s>
<s> <user> , the dual monitors does require some settings adjustment and possible driver selection </s>
<s> <user> : but then the ramdrive speed is super fast , so it ca n't be ram issue can it ? </s>
<s> <user> , but that has been something with linux for awhile </s>
<s> once <unka> i thought ubuntu <unka> your butt and did it all for you :) </s>
<s> <user> , URL/http:/ URL/www.cyberciti.biz/ <unka-/> :d </s>
<s> i 'll try it out and see </s>
<s> <user> , but i could right click on desktop landscape on the test desktop and i get the menu </s>
<s> so , it seems as though thunderbird does n't allow for custom servers for mail .. it wants either imap . or pop3 . in the url which i do n't have on my server ... so , what 's an alternative email client that 's decent to run ? </s>
<s> <user> , once it 's installed i get nothing </s>
<s> <user> , im use <unka-> or mutt . </s>
<s> <user> : afaik its the regular behaviour in unity . i think you can set the oldschool behaviour anywhere but i dont know where </s>
<s> <user> : i cant click on my desktop too </s>
<s> <user> : <unk#> total mem , i 'm assuming megabytes ? </s>
<s> and around 23 gigs free </s>
<s> so , i 'm trying to use redshift with my <unka> <unk#a> . the main thing i'd like is a brightness control . apparently <unka> has been abandoned for many years . is there a replacement ? there 's something called DIR/sys/ DIR/class/ DIR/backlight/ but i do n't see anything there . </s>
<s> nope prolly kilobytes </s>
<s> can you click inside of programs </s>
<s> <user> , aw . chipset mobo ? or some kernel modules then </s>
<s> <user> : yes </s>
<s> <user> -- thanks -- i 'll take a look at those too .. installing evolution right now </s>
<s> <user> , you installed additional ram and your machine got slower ? </s>
<s> <user> : hmm , it 's an asrock <unk#a> , if that makes a difference . i might try removing the two new rams and see if this helps with anything </s>
<s> <user> , i ca n't actually interact with programs with my mouse </s>
<s> <user> : well , now that i think about it , yeah </s>
<s> at all </s>
<s> <user> , if that is the case can you run " dmesg | head -n 200 " and paste it to paste.ubuntu.com </s>
<s> except highlight </s>
<s> <user> : doing that now </s>
<s> <user> : ahh . ok . i missread that you only couldnt click on the desktop ( wallpaper ) </s>
<s> <user> : URL/http:/ URL/paste.ubuntu.com/ <unk#a/> </s>
<s> <user> , yeah i read it the same way at first </s>
<s> <user> : i 'm going to try and set it back to the generic driver in the xorg.conf </s>
<s> i really hate compiz and unity </s>
<s> if the make it so difficult to work with </s>
<s> <user> , looks like you may have an mtrr issue </s>
<s> for example my desktop just locked and i ca n't click on the unlock button </s>
<s> <user> : is that something solvable by googling , or do i need new hardware :( </s>
<s> mtrr default type : <unka> </s>
<s> so i have to go to bios and do stuff ? </s>
<s> <user> , im not too familiar with them except that you can have issues with them . check beyond line 200 of dmesg to see if the kernel eventually finds a suitable way to program it , but usually the kernel wo n't struggle to find an mtrr program </s>
<s> <user> , you might also check for a bios update or ask in a channel like ##hardware </s>
<s> mtrr cleanup actually </s>
<s> ah , hmm </s>
<s> <user> , also are you running 64bit ? i cant tell from that dmesg </s>
<s> <user> : 32bit </s>
<s> <user> , it looks like you are running 32bit in which case i would suggest reinstalling a 64bit version </s>
<s> <user> : i have to use 32bit , this linux box is solely used to compiling simulated iphone apps on opengl :/ </s>
<s> can someone help with openvpn on ubuntu ? </s>
<s> <user> , and why ca n't you do that from 64bit ? </s>
<s> maybe kernel <unka> . </s>
<s> <user> : well , i 'll have to install the 32 bit libraries and stuff , seems like a lot more hassle </s>
<s> <user> is now known as <user> </s>
<s> i 'm gonna try removing the two new rams first and see if that 's truly the case though </s>
<s> how much ram slot u have atm :d </s>
<s> he already left . i was going to ask him the same </s>
<s> oh well </s>
<s> where is ubuntu 's xorg.conf </s>
<s> ive dont another spare for ram putting ram now . hehe </s>
<s> <user> , in terminal : locate xorg.conf </s>
<s> <user> , it wont have one by default </s>
<s> the one in DIR/etc/ DIR/x11/ does n't have anything </s>
<s> i did the locate xorg.conf </s>
<s> new amd driver 13.1 not yet being support on xorg 1.13 ? </s>
<s> <unka> , its hunterdouglas here from earlier , you around ? </s>
<s> hmm , after removing one of the rams , and starting up , i quickly tried to copy a file and it was faster , though still slow </s>
<s> <user> , what are your stick sizes and what slots are they in </s>
<s> now the ram 's in slot #1 and #3 , but now copying 2 gigs to the memory is going at <unk#.> <unka/> </s>
<s> <user> , and what version of ddr is this </s>
<s> ddr3 , 8gb stick , at slots #1 and #3 now </s>
<s> it was slots #1 , #2 and #3 ( out of 4 possible slots before ) </s>
<s> <user> , and before it was ? </s>
<s> same model ? or mix from any different freq ? </s>
<s> hmm , for some reason when i do service vsftpd restart it tells me unknown process then apf start running </s>
<s> before it was at <unk#a./> </s>
<s> <user> : i 'm gonna try go back to the 1 stick of ram , and see how it goes </s>
<s> <user> , i cant remember all the ddr slot matching rules , but having 3/4 slots full is <unka> odd </s>
<s> <user> : well , the 4th one was dead on arrival , and i 'm gonna return it today </s>
<s> just got it yesterday </s>
<s> <user> , <unk#a./> is along the lines of <unk#a-> </s>
<s> ok , looks like copying 2 gigs of things is stuck at <unk#a.> </s>
<s> <unk#a./> sorry </s>
<s> actually should n't ram be way faster than that ? </s>
<s> <user> , sorry misreading the table </s>
<s> <user> , off by a factor of 100 </s>
<s> :) </s>
<s> yeah , it 's pretty slow aye </s>
<s> well , <unka'> gonna try again and see </s>
<s> <user> , i would worry that you did something that makes these unmatched in a way that is causing problems for theos </s>
<s> for some reason vsftpd is not running , i am not seeing any errors when i run service vsftpd start but it refuses to run </s>
<s> try with default setting in bios and run in single mode </s>
<s> <user> : checked its logfile ? </s>
<s> <user> : not entirely sure where to look , DIR/var/ DIR/log/ <unka./> ? </s>
<s> just found out my issue with my email is that my server ( or something ) is blocking me on port 25 ( as i ca n't telnet to it ) </s>
<s> <user> : probably i dont have that installed </s>
<s> why does ubuntu not remember mouse pointer speed in settings ? </s>
<s> isnt there , hmm </s>
<s> yeah , it was definitely the extra ram </s>
<s> :( </s>
<s> <user> : you run that service thing using sudo ? </s>
<s> <user> , you 've done something to break the matching of the ram </s>
<s> <user> : it 's the same ram though , i think </s>
<s> <user> , its always just easier to buy matched products and use them matched </s>
<s> maybe ram freq u install </s>
<s> hello trying to set up rotate cube on 12.04 . each time i press <unka+> my system crashes and i have to reboot . whats going on ? </s>
<s> <user> : yes i did run it as sudo </s>
<s> <user> : is that a command ? </s>
<s> <user> , eh .. no .. im mean your ram mhz installed </s>
