[06:24] <maco> illmortal: cli would include it doesnt have a gui.....
[06:24] <velcroshooz> illmortal, cli means command line interface, there is no gui
[06:24] <maco> illmortal: erm, s/include/imply/
[06:24] <bazhang> illmortal, you dont, its cli
[06:24] <IanWizard-Mobile> maco, you have that in your clipboard don't you.
[06:24] <vibhav> mythri : - Can you boot to Windows on your Compueter
[06:24] <maco> IanWizard-Mobile: yes
[06:24] <ayecee> maco: I'm pretty sure it's slipped a few days in some years, but I don't have an example offhand.
[06:24] <illmortal> oh lawd.
[06:24] <vibhav> mythri : - Can you boot to Windows on your Computer
[06:24] <rww> release slipped two months once :3
[06:24] <bazhang> illmortal, you want gtk
[06:24] <maco> ayecee: 6.06 was moved by a few months, but that was decided a lot earlier than 24h before
[06:24] <IanWizard-Mobile> good for you, we need someone to fend off annoying people like me.
[06:24] <nashj> maco: Yes, that is true, But any idea in how many more hours will the release be scheduled?
[06:25] <bazhang> nashj, no
[06:25] <illmortal> ya i need an interface... I tried using mencoder.. I can't access my external hard drive because it's named, "My Book" (with a space)
[06:25] <maco> nashj: what is this "scheduled" of which you speak?
[06:25] <illmortal> and I cannot rename my external HDD
[06:25] <what1> Is the 11.04 release delayed? It's already almost the 28th in PST!?!
[06:25] <what1> is it out yet??
[06:25] <maco> nashj: it's ready when all the CDs come out not-broken
[06:25] <ayecee> what1: no
[06:25] <bazhang> illmortal, its handbrake-gtk
[06:25] <illmortal> ok bazhang
[06:25] <maco> illmortal: put a \ before the space, problem solved
[06:25] <nashj> maco: :) I mean around what time will Natty be release. Any idea?
[06:26] <maco> nashj: when it's ready
[06:26] <IanWizard-Mobile> what1 it's two hours until the 28th pst
[06:26] <illmortal> really? ok.. let me check. so i would type My\ Book?
[06:26] <nashj> maco: lol! ok... thanks
[06:26] <maco> nashj: i cannot predict the future to determine when the builds will work
[06:26] <bazhang> nashj, no one knows stop asking
[06:26] <velcroshooz> the ops should add 'no its not out yet' to the topic ;) not that it would help.
[06:26] <maco> nashj: get me a crystal ball if you want a better answer!
[06:26] <ayecee> nashj: better yet, join #ubuntu-release-party for breaking news
[06:26] <maco> illmortal: yes
[06:26] <bazhang> velcroshooz, the topic already addresses that
[06:26] <illmortal> ok ^^
[06:26] <Herbs> imortal you could change the label on the drive and remount it or just remount it to a mount point without spaces
[06:26] <Herbs> or use "my book"
[06:27] <Genghiz> anyone knows what time Ubuntu 11.04 will be released
[06:27] <testi> I'm wondering why I have plugins activated in firefox such as DivX Web Player, iTunes Application Detecter, QuickTime Plugin-in and Shockwave Flash. I was hoping and thought that they are not available to Ubuntu. Are they fake and wrapped to totem or vlc?
[06:27] <maco> Genghiz: Natty will be released at some point while it is 28 April in at least one timezone on the planet Terra in the system Sol
[06:27] <Herbs> Im really tempted to write this bash script to tell you lol]
[06:27] <ayecee> Genghiz: breaking news in #ubuntu-release-party
[06:27] <Genghiz> maco that can be +- 12 hours
[06:28] <maco> Genghiz: yep
[06:28] <maco> Genghiz: actually i think its +13/-12
[06:28] <pp7_> is the 11.04 torrent out yet?
[06:28] <maco> Genghiz: there is a UTC+13 timezone after all

[06:28] <Genghiz> maco,  :)
[06:29] <illmortal> ok one last question.. the video is 720p HD quality... should the bitrate still stay @ 1200?
[06:30] <ayecee> illmortal: that's a fairly technical question, and should probably be directed at a forum surrounding the converting application you're using.
[06:30] <illmortal> ok
[06:31] <ayecee> illmortal: I had thought that 1500 was typical for xvid encoding of movies, at least.
[06:31] <illmortal> hm... interesting.. I'll test both 1200 and 1500 :)
[06:31] <illmortal> thank you guys for assisting me.. that was fast and helpful :D
[06:32] <what2> Is the 11.04 release delayed? It's already almost the 28th in PST!?!

[06:40] <ayecee> Glaceon: bad news. do you have more than one hard drive?
[06:41] <Glaceon> no why
[06:41] <maco> Nabbies: Natty will be released at some point while it is 28 April in at least one timezone on the planet Terra in the system Sol
[06:41] <Nabbies> :)
[06:42] <ayecee> Glaceon: because I've seen that happen when the bios and linux have different ideas about the hard drive order, and grub ends up installed on the wrong disk.

[06:43] <ayecee> maco: could you add the release party channel in your copypasta? It would come off as more friendly.
[06:43] <proq> I'm installing ubuntu via wubi, I would like to give the system 80GB but it will only let me give at the most 30.  How do I do this?
[06:43] <jslozier> quit
[06:43] <jslozier> exit
[06:44] <ayecee> jslozier: try /exit
[06:44] <ayecee> or /quit
[06:45] <ayecee> proq: i haven't seen that before. is that a limit from wubi itself, for some reason?
[06:46] <proq> ayecee: I can't imagine why.  I have 119 MB free and the system is only 2 days old so I'm sure it isn't fragmented
[06:46] <ouyes> How to get Fingerprint Scanners Work in ubuntu?
[06:46] <anthony_2409> are we able to download the 11.04 official release yet?
[06:46] <ayecee> I guess that was 119GB free
[06:46] <ayecee> anthony_2409: no. breaking news in #ubuntu-release-party
[06:46] <proq> 119GB free, yes
[06:46] <ouyes> anthony_2409, you have to wait for 24 hours
[06:46] <ayecee> at least!
[06:48] <arun___> why the delay in releasing 11.04?
[06:48] <nutsfornatty> new ubuntu is never released at midnight sharp
=== Lorthirk`ZNC is now known as Lorthirk
[06:48] <nutsfornatty> just wait, it will be released before the 29th
[06:49] <proq> arun___: it isn't the 28th yet
[06:50] <proq> arun___: if they were to release at 11:59 PM PST on the 28th, that would be in 25 hours
[06:50] <proq> not that I'm saying that they said which time zone or hour
[06:51] <maco> proq: and thats only UTC-8! (though itd be PDT right now so -7)... imagine in UTC-12!
[06:51] <proq> yeah  :)
[06:52] <maco> 30 more potential hours
[06:52] <Bob___> When is 11.04 released because I am kinda hoping to have it up and running today
[06:53] <rww> Bob___: sometime before it stops being April 28th somewhere on the planet
[06:53] <proq> happy ubuntu release eve!
[06:53] <Bob___> Im In GMT
[06:53] <Bob___> orBST
[06:53] <proq> I'm installing ubuntu over my windows 7 netbook, happy day
[06:53] <Bob___> Im not sure which
[06:53] <Narwhal> Bob___: before the 29th
[06:53] <histo> Bob___: you could alwasy upgrade now and you will have it.
[06:53] <maco> Bob___: release team is also in BST, so probably before they go to bed :)
[06:54] <proq> what time is it right now in BST?
[06:54] <Bob___> thanks alot
[06:54] <maco> proq: 7am
[06:54] <histo> maco: well it's 7am there
[06:54] <smw> It is 1:54PM in china
[06:54] <theGreatDane> why install over windows 7? windows 7 rocks
[06:54] <maco> histo: that was the question, yes
[06:54] <theGreatDane> its very good and stable
[06:54] <rww> maco: Release manager's LP profile says America/Chicago timezone ;P
[06:54] <maco> rww: they all fly to london
=== Lorthirk is now known as Lorthirk`ZNC
[06:54] <histo> lol
[06:54] <rww> maco: Ah. Curses!
[06:54] <histo> maco: yeah right
[06:55] <smw> theGreatDane, troll. (anything not bashing windows is trolling)
[06:55] <rww> although that would explain the release time tendencies
[06:55] <histo> maco: you read this in a book or just make it up as you go along?
[06:55] <proq> theGreatDane: I'm more productive on ubuntu, for a variety of reasons  :)
[06:55] <maco> histo: what? proq asked what time it is in britain *right now*
[06:55] <aroman> hey, how can I make all of my function keys perform their action without needing to have fn pressed? (i.e invert the fn button). thanks!
[06:55] <ayecee> histo: a little fom column A, a little from column B
[06:55] <maco> histo: so i rounded to the nearest hour... which is 7am. fine so its 6:55am technically, but close enough
[06:56] <BarbaraBush_> argh
[06:56] <histo> aroman: set keyboard shortcut preferences to what ever you want.
[06:56] <BarbaraBush_> dc'ed
[06:56] <maco> histo: though i have no idea why i'm doing the `date` command's job
[06:56] <histo> maco: they dont' fly to london for a release just fyi
[06:56] <smw> aroman, if you ever figure it out let me know. I want to kill HP so badly
[06:56] <aroman> histo: well then i'd lose the ability to use Fwhatever keys
[06:56] <maco> histo: so pgraner did what? swam there?
[06:56] <smw> aroman, I have gotten used to it overtime...
[06:56] <aroman> smw: its just lame though
[06:57] <maco> histo: a few key people do go to london for it
[06:57] <aroman> i need two hands to do something i should be able to do effortlessly
[06:57] <smw> aroman, apparently "no one uses the function keys"
[06:57] <BarbaraBush_> anyone know that time natty is released?
[06:57] <aroman> >:
[06:57] <smw> aroman, agreed
[06:57] <histo> aroman: then not quite sure what you are trying to do?
[06:57] <maco> BarbaraBush_: before its the 29th in the last timezone
[06:57] <Narwhal> BarbaraBush: before the 29th
[06:57] <smw> BarbaraBush, when it happens, it happens
[06:57] <BarbaraBush_> maco: the 28th here
[06:57] <AustinWolfclaw> "When it's done"
[06:57] <histo> aroman: you can't have one key have two functions. You have to use a modifier like the Fn key
[06:57] <maco> BarbaraBush_: its not the 28th in california yet
[06:58] <BarbaraBush_> it is done, was done yesterday lol
[06:58] <aroman> histo: i want the modifier to be pressed all the time
[06:58] <aroman> and un-press when I actually press it
[06:58] <Narwhal> BarbaraBush: contrary to what your family believes the Bush's are not the centre of the universe :)
[06:58] <maco> BarbaraBush_: nor in the very last timezone, which is utc-12. still got 30 hours before the 28th ends!
[06:58] <BarbaraBush_> hehe im not in cali  :P
[06:58] <aroman> e.g,
[06:58] <histo> There haven't been updates for a couple of days now 11.04 has been done.
[06:58] <AustinWolfclaw> i know i was making fun of the duke nukem thing
[06:58] <BarbaraBush_> Narwhal: thats why im in EU :P
[06:58] <histo> Just download the daily iso if you people want it so bad
[06:58] <tanath> so where do i go to gripe about usability?
[06:58] <Narwhal> histo: wrong, I got 40 packages updated earlier today
[06:58] <histo> tanath: devs
[06:58] <maco> histo: there've been respins of the ISOs going on and language pack rebuilds and stuff
[06:58] <aroman> if I hit f1 which both maximizes and toggles volume mute, I want mute to be _default_
[06:59] <smw> I came up with a good idea to beet the fact that all the apt mirrors will be overloaded. I will setup an ec2 instance with apt-cacher and download from the ubuntu ec2 mirror. What are the chances the ec2 mirror will be overloaded?
[06:59] <tanath> histo, that a channel? :P
[06:59] <histo> aroman: then change your keyboard shortcut preferences
[06:59] <smw> beat*
[06:59] <AustinWolfclaw> i'll just DL a torrent lol
[06:59] <aroman> histo: like I said, then I lose the ability to ever call fullscreen with a hotkey
[06:59] <smw> AustinWolfclaw, yeah, but you still can't install other packages
[06:59] <tanath> 11.04 looks to be a bigger disappointment than i feared it would be
[06:59] <histo> aroman: no you can assign that a different hotkey
[06:59] <AustinWolfclaw> I'm not on ubuntu...
[06:59] <histo> aroman: but do what you want.
[06:59] <aroman> histo: hmmph
[06:59] <AustinWolfclaw> I'm on windoes, i'm DLing the ISO
[07:00] <kaatta> ok so i have been trying for 5 days to get help in #lubuntu with setting up a composite manager
[07:00] <nutsfornatty> torrent for the win
[07:00] <aroman> this is a very simple task
[07:00] <AustinWolfclaw> err i mean i'm going to dl the iso torrent
[07:00] <tanath> who's bright idea was it to make windows maximize at the top of the screen, making it impossible to put windows there?
[07:00] <aroman> I want to invert the fn key's function
[07:00] <smw> AustinWolfclaw, but do you plan to install anything?
[07:00] <histo> tanath: well they aren't going to completely change the interface because you don't like it
[07:00] <BarbaraBush_> tanath, how so? 11.04 has up to date packages and an new kernel
[07:00] <smw> AustinWolfclaw, the mirrors slow to a crawl
[07:00] <kaatta> so my question is, what kind of performance difference will i see between 10.04, 10.10, and 11.04
[07:00] <AustinWolfclaw> invert from Fn to Nf?
[07:00] <histo> tanath: just don't drag windows past the panel and they won't maximize
[07:00] <ayecee> kaatta: almost none at all.
[07:00] <aroman> smw: you know, I think I'll write a wrapper that intercepts all Fwhatevery keys and maps them to my liking.
[07:00] <BarbaraBush_> ah GUI noob :P
[07:00] <nutsfornatty> tanath, give it a bit of space. it will work
[07:01] <tanath> histo, have a look on youtube. i'm hardly the only one with issues
[07:01] <kaatta> i know that 10.10 is a bit laggy @ times on this machine
[07:01] <histo> aroman: please stop
[07:01] <aroman> i could knock that out in a few hours this weekend.
[07:01] <aroman> histo: ....?
[07:01] <maco> histo: thats a compiz setting
[07:01] <histo> tanath: I don't have those issues
[07:01] <smw> aroman, what you really need is something that makes the fn key always pressed
[07:01] <histo> tanath: if you don't drag it past the top panel it won't maximize
[07:01] <kaatta> lubuntu runs very well, but i am tired of not being able to get any help w/ setting it up
[07:01] <maco> tanath: you can turn off the maximise on screen edge by changing your screen edge bindings in compiz
[07:01] <aroman> smw: well maybe, but I think it ought to invert
[07:01] <histo> tanath: further you drag the bigger it gets
[07:01] <BarbaraBush_> tanath run gnome classic instead of unity, solved
[07:01] <smw> aroman, when you press the fn key, it should then be un-fn
[07:01] <kaatta> so i was hoping 10.04 would run smoother on this hardware
[07:01] <tanath> histo, nutsfornatty hope so. i haven't tested ubuntu's implementation of it yet. i presumed it'd work like my win7 experience, which i hated
[07:01] <smw> aroman, yeah
[07:01] <aroman> smw: precisely
[07:01] <AustinWolfclaw> from what I'm understanding, Unity will only be on Ubuntu and not the other flavors?
[07:01] <aroman> i'll do just that :)
[07:01] <smw> aroman, I am thinking of how caps lock works
[07:01] <tanath> maco, thanks. i was wondering about that
[07:02] <smw> AustinWolfclaw, correct
[07:02] <maco> aroman: is this a mac? there's a tool somewhere for reversing their use
[07:02] <Spaz_Dynamic> I've got a question that doesn't pertain to when natty is coming out. Who wants to hear it?
[07:02] <histo> tanath: you hvae to go passed it as i've stated but you'll see for yourself
[07:02] <smw> !ask | Spaz_Dynamic
[07:02] <ubottu> Spaz_Dynamic: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
[07:02] <aroman> maco: no, but regardless, that's a software setting in OS X
[07:02] <tanath> BarbaraBush_, actually, i like a number of things about gnome 3, except that it also does the maximize thing, and has eliminated applet support which i need
[07:02] <maco> aroman: and in ubuntu...
[07:02] <aroman> maco: oh it is?
[07:02] <aroman> where?
[07:02] <tanath> histo, mhm. thx
[07:02] <smw> any AustinWolfclaw can you see why torrent does not help? What they need is to have apt use torrents!
[07:02] <maco> aroman: yeah, we have a way to handle mac keyboards. lemme look it up again
[07:02] <Spaz_Dynamic> smw: It's called humor. Everyone is asking about natty. =P
[07:03] <aroman> maco: oh right, that actually makes some sense
[07:03] <ayecee> smw: I think there's an "apt-torrent" package that does that.
[07:03] <aroman> I happen to have a mac with a mac keyboard.
[07:03] <histo> #ubuntu-release-party would be more appropriate rather than here
[07:03] <smw> Spaz_Dynamic, ok, not very funny though... I was kind of excited
[07:03] <AustinWolfclaw> Narwhals narwhals swimming in the ocean, causing a commotion, cuz they're pretty awesome
[07:03] <smw> ayecee, but it is not in general use...
[07:03] <tanath> anyone know if i'll be able to use the win+a shortcut (compiz function) in unity?
[07:03] <Spaz_Dynamic> smw: and techinically, I didn't ask to ask a qustion, or ask who knew the answer, I asked who wanted to hear a question that wasn't "when is natty coming out"
[07:04] <smw> Spaz_Dynamic, ok
[07:04]  * smw raises his hand

[07:06]  * Barbarabush is a very strong man!
[07:06] <ouyes> smw, just a aproxisimite number like 10 100 1000 1000,000
[07:06] <rww> !ot | Barbarabush
[07:06] <ubottu> Barbarabush: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[07:06] <aroman> maco: it won't, the module isn't loaded. but I guess I could digaround and see if I could modprobe it somehow
[07:06] <kaatta> ive tried xubuntu, and lubuntu, and had high hopes for lubuntu but lxde seems to be lacking too much that im used to with ubuntu
[07:06] <Spaz_Dynamic> perhaps not interesting so much as long and slightly convoluted.
[07:06] <Barbarabush> !ot rww
[07:06] <^Phantom^> how do i open 'modules' ?
[07:06] <Roasted> histo, by chance if you upgrade, do you know offhand how much extra hard drive space it uses? I ask because I only have 2gb left on my root partiion. I dont want to attempt it if itll tank it :(
[07:06] <tanath> Spaz_Dynamic, you might have a look at startup disk creator... dunno if it supports multiple though
[07:06] <smw> ouyes, one googol (10^100)
[07:06] <histo> ^Phantom^: what are you trying to do exactly?
[07:06] <Barbarabush> !ot | rww
[07:06] <ubottu> rww: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[07:06] <smw> Spaz_Dynamic, I would say not. If I really wanted to put work into it, I would get the alternative install cds and combine them
[07:06] <andrew_46> kaatta: I have not tried it but many swear by lubuntu:  http://lubuntu.net/
[07:07] <^Phantom^> see if i have !snd-pcm-oss in modules
[07:07] <Spaz_Dynamic> smw, how would I do that then?
[07:07] <^Phantom^> for a friend
[07:07] <nutsfornatty> kaatta, i think the basic gui is much better in gimp. photoshop is a bloated mess. tasks dont "flow" intuitively
[07:07] <histo> ^Phantom^: well you can lsmod | grep snd-pcm  to see if it's running. If not try locate snd-pcm-oss
[07:07] <tanath> nutsfornatty, gimp needs a lot of gui improvements though
[07:07] <kaatta> Andre_Gondim, im on lubuntu now, i have been sitting in #lubuntu for 5 days asking for help getting a composite manager running (google is no help at all)
[07:08] <tanath> nutsfornatty, like 3 overlapping windows? >.<
[07:08] <smw> Spaz_Dynamic, I know very little about ubuntu's usb thing. Does it run a iso in loopback?
[07:08] <histo> ^Phantom^: and I believe it's snd_pcm_oss
[07:08] <kaatta> nutsfornatty, the biggest issue i have with gimp, is on really large projects, the 'undo history' gets so long tthat it will freeze and crash in windows
[07:08] <nutsfornatty> tanath, true. i could see it being the pixelmator (on osx) type killer app for ubuntu with some refinement
[07:08] <andrew_46> kaatta: What did you miss?
[07:08] <tanath> kaatta, there's also the ubuntu forums and askubuntu.com
[07:08] <kaatta> nutsfornatty, i havent really used it in linux yet
[07:08] <x3464> why isn't mangler in the Ubuntu repos.
[07:09] <ouyes> smw, I get a number for accessing ubuntuforums  4581000 ips per day
[07:09] <smw> Spaz_Dynamic, for combining them, you get the alternative install cds, you look at the "pool" directory, and you combine them (they have the same file structure, some files are the same)
[07:09] <Spaz_Dynamic> smw: I don't know that myself. I know that the utility unetbootin uses 7zip to extract the images and then makes a modification to the MBR it
[07:09] <hfx> Why isn't ubuntu out yet!
[07:09] <nutsfornatty> i dont mind the windows. no worse than adobes floating bars
[07:09] <hfx> ?
[07:09] <kaatta> andrew_46, i cant find a composite manager that works properly for things like an app dock, and conky
[07:09] <tsimpson> hfx: because it's not
[07:09] <Spaz_Dynamic> hfx: ubuntu has been out for years. =P
[07:09] <cdoktor19> when 11.04 release
[07:09] <ckw> hfx, #ubuntu-release-party
[07:09] <hfx> Yes, thats what i mean
[07:09] <hfx> thanks
[07:10] <tanath> can upgrade now if you want
[07:10] <kaatta> andrew_46, google doesnt show much of anything that i have found, and nothing that i found helpful @ all about what compositte manager i should even be looking for
[07:10] <ckw> cdoktor19, #ubuntu-release-party
[07:10] <qin> x3464: There is PPA for mangler: https://launchpad.net/~mangler/+archive/mangler
[07:10] <smw> Spaz_Dynamic, you then need to put all the preseed files in (with different names) and make menu entries
[07:10] <andrew_46> kaatta: What are the specs on the computer?
[07:10] <smw> Spaz_Dynamic, It is not easy, however, you will learn alot about the debian installer and automated installs ;-)
[07:10] <histo> kaatta: cairo compmgr is a good one that will work well
[07:10] <histo> kaatta: if you don't want to run compiz
[07:11] <histo> kaatta: Or you can try mudder I believe gnome3 is using that.
[07:11] <Spaz_Dynamic> smw: interesting... I may look into it.
[07:11] <forces> where can i download ubuntu 11.04?

[07:12] <Barbarabush> afaik it has been the 28th for ubuntu for atleast 7h now
[07:12] <kaatta> histo, i searched the synaptic package manager for cairo-compmgr and didnt find it @ all

[07:21] <Spaz_Dynamic> smw, then it will be still in hawaii still
[07:21] <Corey> konaya: You're incorrect.
[07:21] <histo> konaya: there more than 3 and it is off topic here

[07:22] <litropy> I have a Kensington Orbit Optical trackball. As you can see: (http://tinyurl.com/6btnlhv), it doesn't have a scroll wheel.

[07:46] <histo> econnell: community based distro
[07:46] <nsmnmj> gtk
[07:46] <econnell> ubuntu users are the majority of our userbase
[07:46] <histo> econnell: then one of them will make a ppa and produce a deb i'm sure.
[07:46] <maco> econnell: if you dont want to maintain it, did you at least file a needs-packaging bug in ubuntu or (better) a work-needing bug in debian?
[07:46] <econnell> are you serious?  do you even know what this app is and why ubuntu would be the primary userbase?
[07:46] <histo> econnell: ventrillo client or something right?
[07:46] <econnell> maco: there's been a needs packaging bug for over a year
[07:46] <qin> nsmnmj: Did you downmoad gtk?
[07:46] <maco> econnell: i for one have not the slightest idea what app you are talking about
[07:47] <nsmnmj> yes
[07:47] <nsmnmj> from gtk.org
[07:47] <wieldy_BIOS> when new Ubuntu version will released?
[07:47] <nsmnmj> all packages
[07:47] <maco> (i also probably dont care if im getting on fine without it)

[07:47] <econnell> hell... look at our forums... we get messages like this constantly: I am giving Ubuntu 10.10 a test run on my main gaming rig (loving it so far ^.^) and i recently found Mangler which solved my biggest issue of not having a native ventrilo client for linux. I was astonished when i found out that there is a built-in applet for my Logitech G15 keyboard!
[07:48] <Callum__> I was just about to ask his question, heh, oh well
[07:48] <wieldy_BIOS> ok-ok
[07:48] <histo> econnell: I understand your complaint but that's how ever distro works
[07:48] <maco> econnell: but really the bit about "they'll take on their own responsibility" ... the majority of ubuntu devs are volunteers taking care of the packages they care about and ignoring others. the ones being forced to take care of certain packages for their job are in the minority and since your software isnt part of the default install, they won't be forced to touch it at all
[07:48] <econnell> i dont' care how the distro works
[07:49] <histo> econnell: okay
[07:49] <econnell> maco: wtf... seriously?  do you want to take a second to amend that comment before i respond?
[07:49] <histo> econnell: we're just trying to explain
[07:49] <sobersabre> hi. I am on 10.10
[07:49] <histo> !hi | sobersabre
[07:49] <maco> econnell: not particularly. nobody except the canonical employees are REQUIRED to do anythng for ubuntu
[07:50] <econnell> do you think i make any money from this?  do you think i have some personal gain to make?
[07:50] <maco> econnell: fame?
[07:50] <maco> econnell: dunno
[07:50] <histo> econnell: you and every other linux dev
[07:50] <sobersabre> I want to change default resolution of the console. tried messing with grub2, but it has no effect. I think I need to do something related to fb, but I don't know how with grub2.
[07:50] <sobersabre> I added gfxpayload=1024x768x16
[07:50] <DirtyDawg> is the new 11.04 due out today? i just checked the website and its still 10.10?
[07:50] <maco> econnell: im just saying, nobody in particular has any responsibility to anyone else when it comes to what they package, unless its their *job*. its volunteer work. people can CHOOSE to take it or live it
[07:50] <histo> sobersabre: add a vga mode to
[07:50] <maco> DirtyDawg: some time later today
[07:50] <econnell> i've got projects way more important than this retarded project...  my fame for this crap will never be important
[07:50] <DirtyDawg> ahh thx
[07:51] <sobersabre> histo: ok. trying... will be back.
[07:51] <maco> econnell: please don't use offensive language
[07:51] <sobersabre> vbeinfo is supposed to print out the vga modes list ?
[07:51] <sobersabre> histo: the above line was for you :)
[07:51] <econnell> sorry
[07:51] <histo> econnell: then perhaps the project needs to be picked up by someone else. That's how linux works I don't know what you want.
[07:51] <histo> sobersabre: here let me get you link you need something like vga=771
[07:51] <x3464> crap is considered offensive language?
[07:51] <maco> econnell: by the way, ive scrolled back pretty far in the backlog to as far back as i can see you first talking, and i dont actually see you ever saying what software it is you want someone to package, so i guess i wont be picking it up as my next upload
[07:52] <econnell> i just want someone to package it so i don't have to spend an entire weekend building packages for debian based systems... that's all
[07:52] <qin> nsmnmj: Gtk.org do not load, but it is not easy (or sane) to override version.
[07:52] <histo> econnell: I would put a message on your forums asking for such
[07:52] <sobersabre> histo: I ran vbeinfo in grub shell.
[07:52] <sobersabre> there was no "771" in it
[07:53] <maco> histo, econnell: and for that matter, just ask that it be packaged for *debian* -- no reason to package for debian and ubuntu separately. if its in debian, it'll be sync'd to ubuntu automatically
[07:53] <sobersabre> I wrote down and it looks like 0x117 (which would translate into 279)
[07:53] <maco> whatever "it" is (i still don't know)
[07:53] <qin> sobersabre: That means you cannot use 771
[07:53] <sobersabre> qin: so can I use the hex. codes from vbeinfo output ?
[07:53] <maco> x3464: it was comparison to the mentally disabled that was offensive
[07:53] <histo> sobersabre: sorry just saw you are using grub2 read post#17 here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8024427
[07:54] <sobersabre> histo: thanks, there.
[07:54] <bhavesh> while I boot my ubuntu 10.10 I get a *underscore* blinking for about 4 seconds, is there any way to replace it by ubuntu boot screen?
[07:55] <x3464> maco:  how about redonkulous then.
[07:56] <histo> x3464: there were other words used
[07:56] <histo> x3464: scrollback
[07:58] <qin> sobersabre: ok, either: setupcon, or use this (very good) how to: http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/ (it is about old problem, but usable).
[08:00] <econnell> histo: ya know... a good portion of my users are blind... and they use an ubuntu deriviative called vinux, which is a derivative of ubuntu for blind users.   We have worked with them extensively within our app to make sure they had accessibility.  All the while, we were able to maintain casual conversation and even *heaven forbid* make jokes about blindness...  do you really take yourself that serious?
[08:01] <histo> econnell: nope just don't understand what you want? or what your question is? perhaps there is a miss comunication
=== zyz is now known as Guest71727
[08:01] <maco> econnell: i still dont know what your software is, but i will say "thank you for actually bothering with accessibility, unlike just about everyone else"
[08:01] <histo> econnell: I'm just trying to help and explain why it is the way it is.
[08:02] <histo> maco: a ventrillo client. It's a voice chatting app.
[08:02] <maco> econnell: i learned a few weeks ago that 10.10 wasnt installable at all if you're blind and 11.04 is only slightly installable

[08:04] <tuckaway> hi everyone... can anyone suggest a walkthrough or guide to help take necessary steps to secure my ubuntu install.  Just want to make sure I am making my install the most secure I can make it..
[08:04] <kernel> join #c
[08:04] <econnell> maco: histo: incidentlally... vinux includes mangler by default.... because it's useful
[08:04] <maco> econnell: is that the name of the software?
[08:04] <histo> tuckaway: is it just a default install?
[08:04] <histo> maco: mangler
[08:04] <econnell> vinux is the name of the OS
[08:04] <econnell> http://vinuxproject.org/
[08:05] <gr1ncheux> hi there
[08:05] <haxar> hallo
[08:05] <maco> econnell: yeah i know about vinux. ubuntu-accessibility team works with them. im asking "is mangler the name of the software you've been ranting about for the last half hour without naming it?"
[08:05] <smw> tuckaway, is it just a simple desktop install? There is little to secure.
[08:05] <tuckaway> Histo -> yes just the default install.. i have been running ubuntu for about 18 months now and i need to learn how to secure my desktop
[08:05] <histo> tuckaway: secure it from?
[08:06] <mysteriousdarren> lock it down!
[08:06] <econnell> maco: i've name it, linked it, linked revu posts, linked debian bugs...  fine... here: http://www.mangler.org/
[08:06] <smw> tuckaway, what do you mean "secure". What types of attacks are you afraid of?
[08:06] <maco> econnell: thanks. like i said earlier, i scrolled back as far as i saw you talking, and the earliest i see is you telling qin that you deleted....something.. and then just usng "it" to refer to the software so...
[08:07] <tuckaway> just want to make sure i am not leaving anything open on the machine by default.... file sharing, ssh, things of that nature...
[08:07] <smw> tuckaway, what would you do to "secure" windows? What types of attacks do you fear?
[08:07] <gr1ncheux> i installed an ubuntu server 10.04 a few days ago and i'm stocked with an pci express ethernet card with realtek chipset r8168 somebody could help me ?
[08:07] <histo> tuckaway: well if you don't enable them then no.
[08:07] <econnell> maco: i'm frustrated by debian/ubuntu... i shouldn't take it out on you
[08:07] <smw> tuckaway, those are not run by default
[08:07] <smw> tuckaway, I don't even think those are installed by default
[08:07] <llutz_> tuckaway: just normal things to do: don't install stuff you don't need, don't run stuff you needn't, check running services if they are configured as restrictive as possible and "use /dev/brain"
[08:08] <maco> econnell: well i am an ubuntu dev, but in general we prefer *not* to add new packages just to ubuntu, rather they go through debian so A) more users get it and B) more hands to help
[08:08] <proq> llutz_: most people set up /dev/brain > /dev/null
[08:08] <Gloopie>  graph
[08:08] <llutz_> proq: common mistake :(
[08:08] <smw> tuckaway, if you were making a kiosk or something where you are afraid of people with physical access, there is alot to do.
[08:09] <tuckaway> alright maybe i am looking to much into this...
[08:09] <tuckaway> just 2 years into linux and learning
[08:10] <smw> tuckaway, yes, probably. For public computers, it is way to easy to gain root if you have physical access.
[08:10] <Popopo> hello
[08:10] <haxar> hallo
[08:10] <Popopo> :)
[08:10] <lwizardl> so what time will the official release happen today ?
[08:10] <smw> tuckaway, so a school, internet kiosk, etc, would need some work.
[08:10] <tsimpson> lwizardl: there is no set time
[08:10] <tuckaway>  thanks smw
[08:10] <Popopo> well... I am sorry for this question... but I read a lot of FAQs and... I couldn't solve my instalation's problem

[08:10] <theGreatDane> its a process running on my box\

[08:11] <Popopo> may I ask for some help about how to install ubunto for netbook?
[08:11] <smw> rww, can I have that as a bot cmd?
[08:11] <smw> that would be sweet :-)

[08:12] <maco> lwizardl: though their office is in london
[08:12] <lwizardl> ok
[08:12] <smw> tsimpson, yep. Still you have got to admit that would be a nice factoid :-P

[08:14] <Popopo> ??? nobody to help?
[08:14] <maco> Popopo: you havent asked a question
[08:14] <WaltherFI> Popopo: what's your problem?
[08:14] <llutz_> !details | Popopo
[08:14] <ubottu> Popopo: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[08:14] <maco> Popopo: or at least not a question beyond "can i ask a question?" level
[08:14] <Popopo> you are right maco... but I explained it
[08:14] <Popopo> my problem
[08:14] <Popopo> is...
[08:14] <Popopo> I am installing ubunto in my netbook
[08:14] <Popopo> where already I have installed W7
[08:15] <Popopo> and it has 4 partitions already...
[08:15] <Popopo> I have no options in ubunto to installing with win7
[08:15] <WaltherFI> That's something W7 does, recovery partitions etc
[08:15] <Popopo> only erase all the disk
[08:15] <Popopo> or manually
[08:15] <Popopo> yes
[08:15] <Popopo> I know Walther
[08:15] <Popopo> but my question... Have I another option?
[08:16] <Popopo> I mean... I don't want to delete my partitions because my job
[08:16] <bhavesh> would it be safe if  I remove quiet and splash from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nomodeset video=uvesafb:mode_option=1280x1024-24,mtrr=3,scroll=ywrap"
[08:16] <maco> Popopo: i think you need to use manual since once there are 4 primary partitions, you cant fit any more at all. you need to get rid of a primary and put in an extended, then you can put lots in the extended one
[08:16] <maco> Popopo: possibly one of these is already extended, even
[08:16] <bhavesh> I want Ubuntu boot menu instead of the blinking *underscore*
[08:16] <Popopo> got it maco... it is not a bad idea
[08:17] <maco> Popopo: but the 4-primary-max is just plain a hard drive thing, not an ubuntu thing
[08:17] <Popopo> ... I think more than one is extended... but isntalations system don't allow me to install it
[08:18] <Popopo> maco... in anycase... if I put one as extended... if do I format the primary upper this extended... the extended will be formated too?
[08:19] <WaltherFI> Official release out yet?
[08:19] <silvery> Hi, does anyone here have information about where I can get release version of 11.04?
[08:20] <msb___> Will 11.04 beta2 be upgradable to the official release?
[08:20] <DirtyDawg> its due out later today
[08:20] <tsimpson> msb___: yes
[08:20] <DJones> Yes
[08:20] <msb___> thanks
[08:20] <WaltherFI> of course it is upgradeable, but i'd still recommend a clean install

[08:21] <DirtyDawg> i,m waiting to download it, have to say tho, i am not sure about Unity yet, looks weird
[08:21] <msb___> yeah, considering a clean install...
[08:22] <WaltherFI> but guys
[08:22] <WaltherFI> !ot
[08:22] <Popopo> ...
[08:23] <pdg1> hello
[08:23] <Popopo> I can't consider a clear install... too much information very important... and moreover... I need to work with win7 because university and job
[08:23] <WaltherFI> Popopo: go with the manual partitioning, merge some partitions and make space for ubuntu
[08:24] <pdg1> i have a dumb question about mounting a file system. I've mounted this drive many times before but i just installed ubuntu server and i can't remember the file system type nor how to properly edit fstab. any help pointing me to a howto/tutorial?
[08:24] <DirtyDawg> i just made a 100GB partition in preperation for the new release, i think i may wubi it first tho just to check it out
[08:25] <vibhav> where to put auto commands in Xchat?
[08:25] <smw> vibhav, it is under the server configuration
[08:25] <Popopo> ok WaltherFi... got it... but it doesn't work. I tried already and doesn't work because I have already 4 primary partitions
[08:25] <vibhav> where smw?
[08:26] <ScottONanski1> When does 11.04 go live?
[08:26] <llutz_> pdg1: "sudo blkid" gives you the filesystem-type, man mount / man fstab should help to get a working fstab-line
[08:26] <smw> vibhav, server -> network list -> choose a server -> edit
[08:26] <DirtyDawg> on a side note, i wonder why wubi only allows a 30gb max size during setup
[08:26] <smw> vibhav, it is the "connect command"

[08:44] <vibhav> <EbanSoul> no they are using Unity
[08:44] <soreau> sobersabre: Right, I misunderstood you in the first place
[08:44] <sobersabre> proq: in what context.
[08:44] <horse_play> smw, K_45 ok thanks
[08:44] <smw> soreau, yours looked better anyways

[08:44] <proq> sobersabre: you don't see the context?
[08:44] <soreau> sobersabre: Basically what you're seeing is when the intel module is loaded with kms
[08:45] <proq> sobersabre: <EbanSoul> Is Unity still going to be the default for 11.04 or have they moved to KDE?
[08:45] <smw> proq, lmao
[08:45] <vibhav> proq : Unity is a shell interface for the GNOME desktop environment developed by Canonical Ltd for its Ubuntu operating system
[08:45] <DirtyDawg> i heard that X is to be replaced by Wayland, is that right?
[08:45] <soreau> sobersabre: For example you would use something like this as a kernel param: video=VGA-1:800x600
[08:45] <K_45> @ DirtyDawg, eventually
[08:45] <DirtyDawg> :o
[08:45] <proq> vibhav: a shell interface - do you mean a terminal emulator?
[08:45] <smw> DirtyDawg, one day. X must die
[08:46] <DirtyDawg> :(
[08:46] <soreau> sobersabre: But the name VGA-1 may be different
[08:46] <sobersabre> proq: unity is a new (I'm not sure which:) desktop or windows manager.
[08:46] <vibhav> <sobersabre> You can use Startup Manger to Change your resolution?
[08:46] <K_45> @ smv - legacy needs to go
[08:46] <vibhav> proq : its not a terminal emulator
[08:46] <sobersabre> soreau: I don't know where does VGA-1 come from.
[08:46] <vibhav> <sobersabre> I know an easier method to do that
[08:47] <sobersabre> vibhav: to do what ?
[08:47] <vibhav> <sobersabre> To change the resolution
[08:47] <sobersabre> and what do you mean "easier" it is easy anyway: edit a text file, and run update-grub.
[08:47] <vibhav> <sobersabre> there is a progrma for that too
[08:47] <sobersabre> vibhav: to change reso of console ?

[09:31] <alexander__> Incarus6: I want clean install
[09:31] <Incarus6> guest345345, it is mentioned in the user guide
[09:31] <Rehan> guest345345: thanks...is there a way to backup the current system i have?
[09:31] <guest345345> vadviktor: or you can do: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:32] <newbie28> celthunder:  yup its there
[09:32] <vadviktor> guest345345: what do you been by not yet? :)
[09:32] <guest345345> Rehan: What do you need to back-up?
[09:32] <llutz_> guest345345: that won't change the version unless you changed your sources.list(s)
[09:32] <Incarus6> MACscr, it is, but usually you do not get the never version of a software, you get security updates (its like FF4, which wasnt released in 10.10)
[09:32] <Nelval> it seems that today it is the 28th of April 2011
[09:32] <guest345345> Rehan: personally, I have a script for configuting every new system in Install automatically
[09:32] <Rehan> guest345345: i don't know, i was wondering if there's a way i could just make a snapshot of my current system in case the new version doesn't work for me
[09:33] <Incarus6> alexander__, same, they are going to upload it around that time
[09:33] <guest345345> Rehan: You can just copy your /home directory but it's not very clean
[09:33] <MACscr> Incarus6: what is this, Centos? =P
[09:33] <guest345345> Rehan: I see no reason why it wouldn't work.....I've been testing since alpha and it's very stable now
[09:33] <Incarus6> MACsrc, we are both talking about ubuntu, right?
[09:33] <MACscr> Incarus6: yes, i was making a joke about updates
[09:34] <JR0cket1> Rehan: try it out using the Live image first and see if you like it and it all works...
[09:34] <Rehan> guest345345: well 10.10 is considered stable but it was a pain in the ass to get working properly on my sony laptop
[09:34] <vadviktor> guest345345: I see now, it is still the beta as stated in it's note
[09:34] <guest345345> Rehan: yeah, what JR0cket1 said
[09:34] <Incarus6> MACsrc, im not sure if chromium 11 will be released in 11.04
[09:34] <Rehan> JR0cket1: the liveCD doesn't work well for me, the 10.10 liveCD made it seem as if ubuntu wouldn't run on my machine at all
[09:34] <newbie28> celthunder:  any ideas on how to fix it?
[09:35] <elzoog> Any idea how many hours we have until they release 11.04?
[09:35] <guest345345> Rehan: that is probably because of restricted drivers....you can still install them and try to in the Live environment
[09:35] <smw> elzoog, "Ubuntu 11.04 release is scheduled somewhere in the time period when it's April 28th somewhere in the world, not at a specific time."
[09:35] <guest345345> Rehan: and 11.04 has improved a fair bit on the drivers front
[09:35] <Rehan> JR0cket1, guest345345: i had to change video, network and other drivers just to get it to work. I didn't know it was possible to install drivers with a LiveCD?
[09:35] <elzoog> Well, where I am located, it's 5:35 in the afternoon on the 28th
[09:36] <Incarus6> pidh, it could have something to do with your vbox settings
[09:36] <vadviktor> Another Asus eepc question: which architecture image should I get, the x86 or the x64 one?
[09:36] <guest345345> elzoog: Unluck....because the work day has barely started at Canonical HQ
[09:36] <guest345345> Unlucky*
[09:36] <popey> vadviktor: depends which eee pc
[09:36] <Rehan> elzoog: what time zone are you in
[09:36] <msb___> i am going to install the daily built (26 April). cannot see them adding too much more release
[09:36] <matto1990> anyone know what ATI video support is like in natty?
[09:36] <elzoog> I live in Korea
[09:36] <Nelval> elzoog, aw
[09:36] <andeeeuk> yay, its finally been released on the website :)
[09:36] <guest345345> vadviktor: if you're on an atom....x86
[09:36] <JR0cket1> Rehan: If you need to add a lot of packages, install Ubuntu onto a usb stick rather than your hard drive and then you can install what you want without issue
[09:36] <Incarus6> pidh, did you modify your xorg.conf file?
[09:36] <Nelval> 10:36 AM in France, it's so long
[09:37] <Rehan> elzoog: GMT+ ?
[09:37] <andeeeuk> good stuff:)
[09:37] <Rehan> anyone know what time GMT the new version is coming out?
[09:37] <guest345345> http://www.ubuntu.com/
[09:37] <Incarus6> andeeeuk, sure?
[09:37] <vadviktor> guest345345: thanks, that is the info I was not aware of
[09:37] <DJones> Rehan: No set time, just anytime in the next 15 hours
[09:37] <asdfppf> yeah, gmt time for ubuntu 11.04 would be nice
=== lance_ is now known as Guest20282
[09:37] <Rehan> oh i see, thanks Djones
[09:38] <mavis> ,
[09:38] <elzoog> I made the mistake of installing Ubuntu Studio on my desktop.  It's buggy.  But I am waiting for 11.04 instead of installing the normal 10.10
[09:38] <Incarus6> !ch | mavis
[09:38] <ubottu> mavis: Das Schweizer Team finden sie unter #ubuntu-ch, deutschsprachigen Support bekommen sie aber in #ubuntu-de, #kubuntu-de oder #edubuntu-de. Aus regionalen Grunden ist im Schweizer Channel nur Englisch erlaubt. Geben sie einfach /join #ubuntu-at ein! Danke fur ihr Verstandnis.
[09:38] <Incarus6> damn
[09:38] <JR0cket1> Rehan: a good 4 GB Usb memory still will run Ubuntu 11.04 well for testing your hardware and save you over-writing you current system
[09:38] <pidh> Incarus6: i enabled the 3d capabilities will disable them, and i did try to add a new video mode before installing the guest addon and because of that it may look different
[09:39] <guest345345> You can just dual boot to try it if you are worried a LiveUSB will skew the experience too much
[09:39] <Rehan> JR0cket1: oh ok, thats a good idea. I tried creating a bootable usb for 10.10 but kept getting "boot error' on startup
[09:39] <guest345345> and then overwrite both when you're ready to upgrade for real
[09:39] <andeeeuk> no, not yet. If it is not released yet we will wait and waiting is a good thing isnt it so we know it is all good
[09:39] <mavis> learn
[09:39] <elzoog> JR0cket1:  I have 11.04 on one of my sticks.  If I install stuff on it, and then install it on my HD, will it also install the added software?
[09:39] <newbie28> anyone know how to get wifi working on 10.10 i keep getting "bad password" im using Wicd Manager
[09:40] <Incarus6> pidh, did you correctly set your corg.conf file?
[09:40] <soreau> newbie28: What wifi chip is it?
[09:40] <newbie28> soreau : chip set = AR9285
[09:40] <soreau> newbie28: What encryption type?
[09:40] <guest345345> fire up "jockey-gtk" and see if it's offering any resitrcted drivers
[09:40] <Incarus6> MACsrc, https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/stable
[09:40] <newbie28> soreau : wpa
[09:41] <soreau> newbie28: Is there any reason you arent using nm-applet?
[09:41] <newbie28> soreau : dno what that is im new to this
[09:41] <soreau> newbie28: Which version of ubuntu?
[09:41] <newbie28> soreau : 10.10
[09:41] <matto1990> time of release is after noon GMT+1 according to a canonical employee: http://bettween.com/matto1990/yaili
[09:42] <soreau> newbie28: nm-applet is the default network management applet that appears in gnome-panel
[09:42] <guest345345> matto1990: yeah that sounds about same as last time
[09:42] <Rehan> could someone explain to a complete newbie like me whether I should use ubuntu or kubuntu? I don't get the difference really...
[09:42] <guest345345> just after they eat lunch lol
[09:42] <alexander__> Incarus6: Thanks!
[09:42] <guest345345> Rehan: Use Ubuntu
[09:43] <newbie28> soreau : ohh ya i started with that and it wouldnt even connect to the network so ive googled it and did some whole thing that got me to the "Wicd" but now it says "bad password" each time
[09:43] <jatt> use kubuntu
[09:43] <soreau> Rehan: ubuntu has gnome by default and kubuntu has kde by default
[09:43] <guest345345> Rehan: Kubuntu is horrifically ugly
[09:43] <egolost> how do i add an custom installed (not using apitiude) application to unity sidebar?
[09:43] <jatt> at least it doesn't run unity per default
[09:43] <velcroshooz> Rehan, personal preference. ubuntu uses the gnome desktop enviroment by default, kubuntu uses KDE.
[09:43] <jatt> xubuntu
[09:43] <Incarus6> Rehan, Kubuntu is unbuntu with the more like windows looking KDE desktop. Ubuntu uses gnome
[09:43] <pidh> Incarus6: there is no corg.conf in /etc/X11
[09:43] <soreau> Rehan: The official ubuntu distro uses gnome, if that tells you anything..
[09:44] <j0shdrunk0nwar> Rehan: try both with live cd
[09:44] <sobersabre> vib	when you write - I need to hunt your messages /window list
[09:44] <Incarus6> pidh, I know, you have to create one
[09:44] <Zavior> yay I think I'm getting Ubuntu to finally install :) !
[09:44] <guest345345> Yeah...KDE stack is built on better technology......but it's naming conventions are annoying and it's full of BLOAT
[09:44] <JR0cket1> elzoog: If you install Ubuntu on a Usb stick, then it wont have the installer packages - you could add them, but I personally would do a reinstall and perhaps grab the package list off the usb stick and take a copy of everything in /etc
[09:44] <stefan__1> egolost: Start Application --> right click and select, that the application always show up
[09:44] <Zahrada> At least till the release of 11.04 later this day, it uses gnome :P
[09:44] <Zavior> Anyone know the version of python that comes with Ubuntu, or actually...if python does come included?
[09:44] <egolost> stefan__1: but how do i get my application to show up in start applications?
[09:45] <newbie28> soreau : should i switch back?? if so how the heck do i do that lol
[09:45] <Zavior> 10.10
[09:45] <guest345345> Zavior: 2.7
[09:45] <Zavior> thanks
[09:45] <soreau> newbie28: I guess you would have to undo whatever you did to switch in the first place
[09:45] <stefan__1> egolost: You mean at the unity applications menu?
[09:45] <Rehan> if I didn't create a swap partition when i installed 10.10 (i have two partitions on the laptop drive but one is for win7), does that mean I can't hibernate the system?
[09:45] <guest345345> Zavior: np
[09:45] <egolost> stefan__1: YES
[09:45] <Bilz> hello, im trying to follow this to set up vnc: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC#Guide%20to%20example%20scenarios and I'm currently on a windows machine using putty. I have sshed to my home computer but I don't know how to get the public key which I apparently need to add to a file
[09:45] <stefan__1> echolost: alternativly try to start the app over a terminal
[09:45] <velcroshooz> Rehan, yes.
[09:46] <Rehan> velcroshooz: oh i see. I should still be able to suspend though right?
[09:46] <guest345345> Zavior: actually I just checked....11.04 is running 2.7.1
[09:46] <pidh> Incarus6: any pointer to a guide how to create it - i am new to linux and have no coding skills.
[09:46] <stefan__1> egolost: otherwise you can start the menu ?reorganization? with a command, which I actually don't know --> if you need the app in the unity menu
[09:47] <tomtit> morning all
[09:47] <kichawa> \o
[09:47] <velcroshooz> Rehan, as i understand it, i believe so. hibernate is going to require a swap partition equal to or possible a bit more than your ram size.
[09:48] <Rehan> velcroshooz: ok cool
[09:48] <guest345345> velcroshooz: that's not necessarily true....it only needs to be as big as resident memory...not total memory
[09:48] <mavis> anybody here?
[09:48] <guest345345> or the average you generally use anyway
[09:48] <Rehan> trying to figure out why no matter what i try my laptop won't suspend/standby. Well actually it will suspend but when i try to turn it back on it boots up just like a cold boot
[09:49] <guest345345> Rehan: a default install allocates 1:1 memory:swap
[09:49] <guest345345> so unless you used custom partitions it should be enough
[09:49] <guest345345> or unless you added more memory since
[09:49] <Rehan> guest345345: i already had a 10gb partition made for ubuntu and i just installed ubuntu onto that.
[09:50] <arnauddebordeaux> clear
[09:50] <guest345345> oh...well that is not default then
[09:50] <Zavior> any down sides to encrypting the home directory?
[09:50] <arnauddebordeaux> hello all!
[09:50] <velcroshooz> guest345345, as your use can fluctuate though i think most tutorials suggest a size equal to your ram to be on the safe side.
[09:50] <arnauddebordeaux> need emergecny help!
[09:50] <guest345345> velcroshooz: yeah....that is optimal if you plan to hibernate
[09:50] <green_> when is the new release scheduled to happen?
[09:50] <guest345345> velcroshooz: but not strictly required most of the time
[09:50] <mythri> I need help. Using Ubuntu 10.10. I have recovered my files through Windows and have only retrieved a single file Root.disk. Can anyone help?
[09:51] <guest345345> tutorials are generally aimed at people who prefer not to think much
[09:51] <soreau> arnauddebordeaux: Dial 911 or whatever the emergency hotline is in your country
[09:51] <mavis> beiju
[09:51] <arnauddebordeaux> sorry, soreau?
[09:51] <guest345345> and the easiest way to encapsulate anyone is to just play safe
[09:51] <guest345345> everyone*
[09:51] <Incarus6> pidh, sry, I was afk. try to change resolution with "xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768" or similar https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution
[09:51] <Macer> uhm
[09:51] <Rehan> is making a win7 partition smaller to create space for a new partition (for ubuntu swap) considered a workaround or is it as good as setting up a partition on a clean drive from scratch?
[09:51] <arnauddebordeaux> i've tried all i know
[09:51] <mavis> jiu
[09:52] <guest345345> Rehan: do you really need Win7 for something?
[09:52] <jatt> games
[09:52] <arnauddebordeaux> does anyone konw how to use the grub rescue?
[09:52] <Rehan> guest345345: yeah its way more reliable than ubuntu
[09:52] <Macer> arnauddebordeaux: might help if you said what the problem was
[09:52] <Incarus6> Rehan, Is it as good as from a clean drive
[09:52] <mavis> jiu meiyou huishuo zhongwen de ren zai ?
[09:52] <soreau> ! grub2 | arnauddebordeaux
[09:52] <ubottu> arnauddebordeaux: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[09:52] <guest345345> Rehan: 10GB is more than enough for an average ubuntu install but it may not give it enough room to allocate the recommended swap partition
[09:52] <guest345345> Rehan: and that may be your problem
[09:52] <Rehan> guest345345: i see, thank you
[09:53] <mythri> I need help. Using Ubuntu 10.10. I have recovered my files through Windows and have only retrieved a single file Root.disk. Can anyone help?
[09:53] <Rehan> guest345345: when you say "allocate the recommended swap partition" do you mean a third partition? I have a 500 GB drive and made a 490 GB NTFS win7 partition and a 10 GB ext4 ubuntu partition. Can the swap file be put on that same 10gb ext4 partition?
[09:53] <walent> hello
[09:54] <arnauddebordeaux> but there is no tuto for how to use this grub rescue, and I don't have any other solution...
[09:54] <arnauddebordeaux> so
[09:54] <arnauddebordeaux> my problem
[09:54] <walent> what is name of ubuntu release party?
[09:54] <nick-nack> 11.04 available for download yet?
[09:54] <walent> channel
[09:54] <guest345345> Rehan: yes...swap must be seperate......the installer allocates it automatically
[09:54] <shomon> is there a curses alternative to diffusion? it just had my load average up really high... no idea what it was doing
[09:54] <Incarus6> nick-nack, No
[09:54] <mavis> haishi jiang zhongwen ba
[09:54] <Marco1> how long till 11.04 realease?
[09:54] <arnauddebordeaux> i have a computer whose CD reader doesn't work
[09:54] <guest345345> Rehan: for a defualt full-disk install it will generally be 1:1 with your memory
[09:54] <walent> is there ubuntu release pary?
[09:54] <mythri> Is root.disk enough for recovering all my documents from ubuntu 10.10?
[09:54] <Zavior> floodbot lol?
[09:54] <guest345345> Rehan: but if you only give it 10GB disk to work with...maybe it will allocate less
[09:54] <Incarus6> Marco1, It will be released in the next hours. There is no exact release time
[09:55] <mythri> Is root.disk enough for recovering all my documents from ubuntu 10.10?
[09:55] <guest345345> Rehan: I'm not sure exactly because I usually do custom and allocate swap myself
[09:55] <Rehan> guest345345: will it create a new partition automatically? sorry i'm being unclear about it, trying to understand
[09:55] <botcity> !party
[09:55] <ubottu> Please remember that #ubuntu, #kubuntu, #xubuntu, and #edubuntu are support channels. To countdown to Natty release and then party once it happens, join #ubuntu-release-party - For in-person parties, see http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/global/744/detail/
[09:55] <Rehan> guest345345: oh ok
[09:55] <walent> join
[09:55] <guest345345> Rehan: yes, any install will allocate swap by default
[09:55] <mythri> Is root.disk enough for recovering all my documents from ubuntu 10.10?
[09:55] <guest345345> Rehan: the simple/default install will hide it from you but it will do it nonetheless
[09:55] <cfc_{Pawpad}> hello =3
[09:56] <Rehan> guest345345: oh ok
[09:56] <guest345345> Rehan: Windows and Mac to exactly the same too
[09:56] <guest345345> do*
[09:57] <Rehan> guest345345: oh ok. when i do fdisk -l i see an NTFS partition then an Extended and a third Linux one
[09:57] <cfc_{Pawpad}> anyone know if theres gonna be a release of Ubuntu server 11.04 anytime soon?
[09:57] <mythri> Is root.disk enough for recovering all my documents from ubuntu 10.10?
[09:57] <guest345345> Rehan: actually...perhaps Windows 7 only uses a "pagefile" by default....but it's recommended to have a seperate parition for Win7 just the same
[09:57] <Incarus6> cfc_{Pawpad}, it will be released today
[09:58] <cfc_{Pawpad}> cool
[09:58] <guest345345> Rehan: but Windows sucks of course....so I can understand why they don't follow best practices by default
[09:58] <Incarus6> mythri, can you explain what you exactly did?
[09:58] <cfc_{Pawpad}> cant wait =3
[09:58] <Macer> and i just finished installing 10.10 server :) go figure
[09:59] <cfc_{Pawpad}> Thanks
[09:59] <Zavior> Macer: I'm in the same boat :)
[09:59] <Macer> Zavior: upgrading the dist is easy enough
=== MmikeMRMA is now known as Mmike
[09:59] <Macer> personally i would rather wait a month or so before i instealled 11.04
[09:59] <Zavior> I'm not to savy on linux :)
[09:59] <mythri> Incarus6, I used disk internals and recovered my root.disk from ubuntu through Windows xp
[09:59] <guest345345> Taking bets on release time.......my money is on 13:15 GMT
