[06:12] <andre_> hi. I recently upgraded to 13.04 and noticed that the gdb shipped with it is awfully slow. is there a specific reason to ship a "7.5.91.20130417-cvs-ubuntu" which looks like a random build from cvs instead of using an upstream 7.5 or 7.6 release, both of which seem to work fine?
[06:12] <ObrienDave> yea, knew it wouldn't last. *SIGH*

[06:14] <ObrienDave> andre_, usually the repos offer older versions for stability reasons
[06:15] <ObrienDave> andre_, you can always install the newer versions, if you like
=== guest782 is now known as kduikk
[06:16] <andre_> ObrienDave: 7.5.91.20130417 looks like bleeding edge at the time, so there must be some reason to use that instead of a tested upstream release. I wonder what that reason could have been.
[06:17] <somsip> !info gdb
[06:17] <ubottu> gdb (source: gdb): The GNU Debugger. In component main, is optional. Version 7.6~20130417-0ubuntu1 (raring), package size 2211 kB, installed size 5865 kB
[06:17] <ObrienDave> could be anything. i haven't a clue
[06:17] <somsip> andre_: so...where did you get the 7.5.91 version from?
=== kduikk is now known as askabt
=== askabt is now known as guest7821
=== guest7821 is now known as guest7822
[06:18] <andre_> somsip: from that package. if you install it, and run gdb --version it says :/data/dev/debugger/gdb-ubuntu-13.04/gdb-7.6~20130417$ gdb --version  ->  GNU gdb (GDB) 7.5.91.20130417-cvs-ubuntu
[06:18] <ObrienDave> andre_, was that version on the install disk?
[06:18] <andre_> ObrienDave: I don't have an install disk, just upgraded
[06:19] <ObrienDave> ok
[06:19] <somsip> andre_: If that is the case, you may need to raise a bug.
[06:19] <somsip> andre_: have you ever installed gdb from a PPA in the past?
[06:19] <andre_> somsip: so arguably even the build looks odd as the package version does not really coincides with what version has been patched into the binary
=== Guest68063 is now known as harish
[06:21] <somsip> I see other bug reports concerning other issues that suggest that the current raring version of gdb does return the 7.5.91 version, eg: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gitg/+bug/1173428

[07:40] <snypzz> also have the EDIMAX AC1200 not working on UBUNTU 13.04
[07:40] <ObrienDave> rigo88, probably just a bad connection
[07:40] <foofoobar> matanya: ObrienDave and after this I should put the swap on the hdd?
[07:40] <Bgr_bgr> hii
[07:40] <Bgr_bgr> i m just testing
[07:40] <matanya> good idead foofoobar
[07:40] <rigo88> shit i suck with the thing since 2 days now :D
[07:41] <AnkitAgrawal> Hi.....I messed something in ubuntu 12.10 recovery mode bcoz of which I am getting 'ieee80211 phy0 : ........' instead of the login screen... any solutions?
[07:41] <szahrat> foofoobar try creating a separate swap partition
[07:41] <ObrienDave> foofoobar, yes, and modify fstab to load most temp files to ramdisk if you can
[07:41] <Bgr_bgr> what this is all about
[07:41] <Bgr_bgr> ????
[07:41] <ObrienDave> rigo88, keep it clean please
[07:42] <matanya> AnkitAgrawal: can you please be more detailed?
[07:42] <ObrienDave> Bgr_bgr, may we help you?
[07:43] <rigo88> u should add this line to the fstab:
[07:43] <rigo88> tmpfs   /tmp    tmpfs   defaults,noatime,mode=1777      0       0
[07:45] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya : I am using ubuntu 12.10...Since a few days, my ubuntu does not boot to the login screen after a hard shutdown(eg: heat)....Hence I went into the recovery mode
[07:46] <foofoobar> my fstab looks strange.. UUID=6dd239ec-863c-444b-84ed-fde64f2d91b3 none            swap    sw              0       0
[07:46] <matanya> ok, and what is the problem with that AnkitAgrawal ?
[07:46] <foofoobar> I expected something like /dev/sda5 instead of this UUID thing
[07:46] <matanya> you can change that foofoobar
[07:46] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya: I performed some apt-get update after logging as root from recovery mode and disk check
[07:47] <histo> foofoobar: you can use sudo blkid to list all your disks by UUID so you can understand which partition is which
[07:47] <ObrienDave> foofoobar, UUID is unique to every device
[07:47] <ObrienDave> wb dirk :)
[07:47] <rigo88> foofoobar: thats normal. i think.
[07:48] <matanya> AnkitAgrawal: i still don't see where is the problem
[07:48] <histo> foofoobar: We now use uuid because it is more predictable than /dev/sdX#  which can change.
[07:48] <foofoobar> matanya: so to create a new swap: 1) Create partition on my hdd 2) Change fstab swap to the new partition 3) swapoff -a; mkswap /dev/sdbX; swapon -a ?
[07:48] <ObrienDave> DIRK_, you ready to continue?
[07:48] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya : And now when I boot, the original problem of no login screen is still there...but it also keeps outputting something like 'ieee80211 phy0 : ......' along with a timestamp
[07:48] <histo> !swap | foofoobar
[07:48] <ubottu> foofoobar: swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[07:49] <foofoobar> histo: yeah I'm currently on that page. Just want to verify that I understood it correct
[07:49] <DIRK_> when you first boot up is it normal for the screen to go purple for awhile and then it start saying it can't find the boot file or something... then lines and lines of commands pour down the screen killing this and that
[07:49] <szahrat> foofoobar have you created the swap file urself?
[07:49] <matanya> yes foofoobar
[07:49] <foofoobar> szahrat: the current? No, the installer did it
[07:49] <foofoobar> matanya: can I do this while the system is running or also from livecd?
[07:49] <matanya> you can
[07:50] <matanya> though i'd recommend different drive if you have
[07:50] <matanya> not just a partition
[07:50] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya : ??
[07:50] <ObrienDave> DIRK_, possibly because you got suck in an upgrade situation
[07:50] <foofoobar> matanya: The new swap will be on the hdd
[07:50] <DIRK_> ya i'm ready... sudo get-update? i forgot
[07:50] <matanya> AnkitAgrawal: what runlevel are you in?
[07:51] <szahrat> AnkitAgrawal, whats actually ur question?
[07:51] <matanya> AnkitAgrawal: use the runlevel command
[07:51] <ObrienDave> DIRK_, let's continue. open a terminal. "sudo apt-get update"
[07:51] <AnkitAgrawal> I am currently on windows
[07:51] <foofoobar> sda (/) = SDD and swap currently; sdb = HDD currently only for files. I will move the swap to the hdd then
[07:51] <ObrienDave> no quotes
[07:51] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya , szahrat : I am currently on windows
[07:51] <matanya> so go on ubuntu AnkitAgrawal
[07:52] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya : ok....but it wont show the login screen...should I then go into recovery mode?
[07:52] <ObrienDave> DIRK_, once that finishes, "sudo apt-get upgrade"
[07:52] <matanya> foofoobar: hint for next time: ssh for /boot /hdd for / and /home
[07:52] <matanya> what happens if you try the gui and not the recovery AnkitAgrawal ?
[07:53] <foofoobar> matanya: the root file system on the hdd?
[07:53] <matanya> yes foofoobar
[07:53] <foofoobar> I thought its a good idea placing this on the sdd because it's faster to load stuff from there
[07:53] <matanya> or if you barely change it, it can be on ssd foofoobar
[07:54] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya : the statements similar to this query show up with a timestamp...https://www.google.co.in/search?q=ieee80211+phy0+brcms_ops_bss_info_changed&oq=ieee80211+phy0&aqs=chrome.2.57j0l3.9106j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
[07:54] <matanya> it depends on the type of user you are foofoobar
[07:54] <matanya> ok, AnkitAgrawal seems like you have driver issues
[07:54] <Dirk> sorry man the page keeps saying it must restart and shuts down on me...
[07:55] <ObrienDave> Dirk, which page?
[07:55] <foofoobar> matanya: so all the new laptops only have a SSD, they also have their swap/root in their ssd, is this a bad behaviour?
[07:55] <Dirk> this chat site page
[07:55] <ObrienDave> you on WebChat?
[07:55] <Dirk> it seems stable now
[07:55] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya : I guess this problem because of installing and then removing gnome....before that everything was fine
[07:55] <Dirk> ya
[07:56] <matanya> foofoobar: swap is a bad idea, root is mostly ok
[07:56] <Dirk> webchat.freenode.net
[07:56] <matanya> AnkitAgrawal: i doubt it
[07:56] <szahrat> Dirk get xchat
[07:56] <ObrienDave> Dirk, ok, cheer up. we'll get through this one way or another :))
[07:56] <matanya> AnkitAgrawal: if you can get a shell, i can help out
[07:56] <Dirk> lol... ok sudo get-update ???
[07:56] <foofoobar> matanya: okay. so first I will check with fsck when I have a bootcd available
[07:56] <ObrienDave> DIRK_, let's continue. open a terminal. "sudo apt-get update"
[07:57] <foofoobar> then I will move my swap to my hdd
[07:57] <foofoobar> I hope this bug will not come again :/
[07:57] <matanya> good luck foofoobar
[07:57] <ObrienDave> Dirk,  you can copy and paste right from these screens
[07:57] <histo> foofoobar: you can turn down swappiness to avoid using swap. But I would still have one on an SSD just incase.
[07:57] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya : ok ...i will login to my shell as root in recovery mode and will connect with u on irc in 5 min from a different system. Is that ok with you?
[07:57] <Dirk> ok it worked i guess
[07:57] <matanya> np AnkitAgrawal
[07:58] <Dirk> Reading package lists... Done
[07:58] <ObrienDave> Dirk,  cool, hit up arrow, change update to upgrade
[07:58] <foofoobar> histo: so when using a tmpfs this will slow down my system in times where I need a lot of RAM?
[07:58] <Dirk> .
[07:59] <Dirk> continue Y    obviously
[07:59] <ObrienDave> Dirk, is it doing something? yes ;))
[07:59] <histo> foofoobar: no mount stuff like browser cache /tmp and some things in /var to tmpfs  also enable noatime,discard options in fstab for filesystems that are on the SSD.  But you want a swap present just incase ram fills so your system doesn't run out of memory.
[08:00] <matanya> foofoobar: what is the amount of RAM on your system?
[08:00] <Dirk> if it's going to go thru the entire list that it suggested......... it's gona take awhile. it had like 240 updates it wanted to to do
[08:00] <Dirk> but yes it's downloading stuff
[08:01] <ObrienDave> Dirk, ok, just kick back and relax. VERY important to not interrupt it. back in a few
[08:01] <Dirk> thanx abunch dude...
[08:01] <ObrienDave> no prob
[08:01] <foofoobar> matanya: 4GB
[08:01] <matanya> do you tend to fill it up foofoobar ?
[08:02] <foofoobar> I'm currently at 25%, I think I do not fill it up often
[08:02] <foofoobar> I'm using i3wm with some command line stuff and chrome, so I dont think I'm filling it up often
[08:02] <histo> foofoobar: Do what you want but realize if you run out of memory your system will hang. Also you cannot hibernate without a swap afaik
[08:03] <matanya> so you don't really need the swap
[08:03] <foofoobar> histo: I dont want to deactivate the swap, I just want to move it to a HDD
[08:03] <foofoobar> matanya: As I understood the swap is for the "emergency" when I run out of RAM
[08:03] <histo> foofoobar: Yeah then just make a partition on the HDD mkswap on it and swapof and swapon to the new part. Also add it to fstab . You can get the uuid with blkid
[08:04] <histo> foofoobar: and also hibernation
[08:04] <histo> foofoobar: and cache
[08:04] <histo> foofoobar: You can reduce the use of swap by adjusting your swappiness
[08:05] <histo> foofoobar: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#Why_do_I_need_swap.3F
[08:06] <ObrienDave> Dirk, hows it going? how much time left?
[08:09] <drasko> Hi. My embedded device hangs for a long time on "Starting Userspace bootsplash". How to prevent bootsplash - I do not need it, I am using console only
[08:10] <nublet> hi
[08:10] <nublet> do I need Ubuntu restricted extras on 13.04
[08:10] <nublet> ?
[08:10] <matanya> drasko: you can set it in your grub conf
[08:11] <ObrienDave> nublet, restricted extras allow you to view certain DVD's and some music codecs
[08:11] <matanya> nublet: it depends if you have stuff that needs it
[08:11] <nublet> I juts want the fonts mainly
[08:11] <matanya> it won't hurt you to install it nublet
[08:12] <nublet> I try to install and it says "these items must be removed" libavcodec53, libavutil51"
[08:12] <ObrienDave> nublet, that is normal
[08:12] <nublet> I can cancel or install anyway
[08:12] <matanya> install
[08:12] <nublet> ok tx
[08:12] <ObrienDave> welcome
[08:12] <drasko> matanya, I do not have grub, I am using ubuntu in an embedded device with U-Boot
[08:13] <chiffa> hello there. I would need some help with resolving some issues related to installing Linux in dual boot with Win8 on a recent machine (so far no solution found via google and forums)
[08:13] <ObrienDave> drasko, GRUB is the boot loader
[08:13] <histo> chiffa: what problem are you having?
[08:13] <drasko> ObrienDave, U-Boot is the bootloader
[08:14] <chiffa> I have a live usb with Linux secure 13.04 (md5/sha1 checked, created using LiLi)
[08:14] <matanya> chiffa: do you have secure boot enables?
[08:14] <chiffa> disabled in bios
[08:14] <matanya> *s/s/d
[08:14] <chiffa> when I try to boot, after gub prompts me to select install or try linux, screen goes black
[08:15] <chiffa> nomodeset option does not seem to help
[08:15] <chiffa> and I have geforce GT650M
[08:15] <ObrienDave> drasko, sorry. not familiar with U-boot
[08:15] <chiffa> Is there anything else to try?
[08:15] <histo> chiffa: are you using the 64bit version of 13.04?
[08:15] <Dr_willis> chiffa,  boot to text mode and perhaps just install the nvidia-current package to get drivers for your card? or have you allready installed the drivers?
[08:15] <chiffa> yup
[08:15] <histo> chiffa: also what the hell is linux secure?
[08:16] <chiffa> ok, how do you boot to text mode?
[08:16] <Dr_willis> !text
[08:16] <ubottu> To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[08:17] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya : there??
[08:18] <matanya> yes AnkitAgrawal
[08:18] <AnkitAgrawal> matanya : I  have  logged  in  as root in recovery mode
[08:18] <foofoobar> matanya: one additional question: My SDD currently looks like this: 1. HFS (osx) 2. EXT3 (Ubuntu Root) 3. Swap 4. Boot. I want to increase the size of the ubuntu root now.
[08:18] <foofoobar> My OSX Disk utility lets me resize the first partition, but not adjust the size of the second one
[08:19] <matanya> foofoobar: use gparted in the live cd
[08:19] <histo> Dr_willis: that factoid is off
[08:19] <foofoobar> Someone here told me to use gparted for this. Is this safe to move the "beginning" of the second partition to increase the size?
[08:19] <matanya> gparted is safe only if you know what you are doing
[08:19] <ObrienDave> foofoobar, only if there is room in the front
[08:19] <matanya> AnkitAgrawal: runlevel
[08:19] <elfranne> when I write export SOME_PATH=/to/a/folder in crontab it produce error : bad minute
[08:19] <Dr_willis> foofoobar,  jot down the UUID also - just in case it changes..
[08:20] <foofoobar> ObrienDave: the room is not in the front
[08:20] <matanya> !cron Elfix
[08:20] <ObrienDave> foofoobar, then NO it is not safe
[08:20] <matanya> !cron elfranne
[08:20] <Dr_willis> foobarba1,  if you shrink the ox-s partion thats at thre front of the HD.. then wheres the unallocated space at?
[08:20] <foofoobar> one moment, I will make a screenshot of gparted
[08:21] <Dr_willis> at the front of the HD. or btween the 1 and 2 partitions?
[08:21] <elfranne> matanya, command failed
[08:21] <matanya> elfranne: your cron syntax is in correct
[08:22] <elfranne> matanya, so you re not allowed to export variables in crontab ? that sounds unlikey
[08:22] <chiffa> ok, that didn't work neither
[08:23] <matanya> you may, but you need to use syntax like ***** bash export SOME_PATH=/to/a/folder elfranne
[08:23] <ObrienDave> Dirk, hows it going? how much time left?
[08:23] <foofoobar> ObrienDave, Dr_willis, matanya: http://imgur.com/a6YZTPE this is the SSD. I want to decrease the HFS and increase the ubuntu
[08:24] <[nas]peter> I run a dual boot of windows 7 Ultimate and Ubuntu 12.04, does anyone know if this could cause bad IO?
[08:24] <matanya> shouldn't [nas]peter
[08:25] <elfranne> matanya, but SOME_PATH=/to/a/folder works fine ....
[08:25] <histo> [nas]peter: No bad drives cause bad IO
[08:25] <matanya> foofoobar: you can resize /dev/sda3 and move the space to ubuntu
[08:25] <[nas]peter> The drive is about a month old >.>
[08:25] <[nas]peter> and it didn't have issues running windows
[08:26] <matanya> elfranne: what are you trying to achieve?
[08:26] <histo> [nas]peter: run smartmontools
[08:26] <foofoobar> matanya: and /dev/sda2 ?
[08:27] <matanya> it is the ssd foofoobar
[08:27] <ObrienDave> foofoobar, probably you need to make sda2 smaller, slide sda3 over to the left and then make sda4 larger
[08:28] <foofoobar> ObrienDave: this is possible? :D
[08:28] <ObrienDave> foofoobar, partitions MUST be continuous
[08:28] <elfranne> matanya, unless you use export SOME_PATH=/to/a/folder that variable will not be available inside a script i launch from the crontab
[08:28] <matanya> elfranne: why don't you export it in the script itself?
[08:29] <elfranne> matanya, because i need it in the crontab
[08:29] <ObrienDave> foofoobar, yes, you don't have a lot of room to work with. look for partitionmanager. it's supposed to handle this situation a bit better. i don't know if Gparted can actually move data
[08:29] <elfranne> matanya, and used inside multiple scripts
[08:29] <chiffa> ok, problem solved: I didn't disable Secure boot, but only fastboot :S
[08:29] <chiffa> have a good day everyone
[08:30] <matanya> call the script, and in the first line export the var
[08:30] <Guest83992> I have edited /etc/dhcp/dhcpclient.conf and also tried adding & editing /etch/dhcp3/dhcpclient.conf to add prepend domain-name-servers ..., yet /etc/resolv.conf doesn't show the dns servers
[08:30] <foofoobar> ObrienDave: I have a better idea: If I move the swap to the HDD, I can extend /dev/sda4 with the size of the swap
[08:30] <Guest83992> are the dns servers listed somewhere else now ? or is it something I am doing wrong ? help is appreciated...
[08:30] <foofoobar> this would give me additional 4GB
[08:31] <maum> does anyone know how to download the source from http://mirror.emulab.net/cygwin/
[08:31] <maum> There are a bunch of files.
[08:32] <matanya> maum: wget
[08:32] <ObrienDave> foofoobar, yes, that would work also
[08:34] <foofoobar> okay, good
[08:34] <maum> matanya: thanks.
[08:34] <[nas]peter> SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED
[08:34] <[nas]peter> weird
[08:34] <foofoobar> matanya, ObrienDave: thanks for your help!
[08:35] <dhruvasagar> hey, can anyone help regarding prepending dns servers ?
[08:35] <matanya> np foofoobar
[08:35] <foofoobar> I will try to move the swap first, and when I'm home I can to the fsck and resize my root partition
[08:35] <dhruvasagar> I asked the question a little while ago as Guest...
[08:35] <ObrienDave> foofoobar, not a problem
[08:35] <foofoobar> because I have no livecd here
[08:36] <matanya> dhruvasagar: what do you need?
[08:36] <[nas]peter> hmm
[08:36] <ObrienDave> dhruvasagar, you can try the google public DNS servers. 8,8,8,8 and 8,8,8,4. I THINK :D
[08:36] <[nas]peter> it seems my drive isn't malfunctioning
[08:36] <dhruvasagar> matanya: I tried adding prepend domain-name-servers to /etc/dhcp/dhcpclient.conf and restarted networking
[08:36] <ObrienDave> sorry, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.8.4
[08:36] <dhruvasagar> ObrienDave: that I know, not my problem...
[08:36] <matanya> any output?
[08:36] <dhruvasagar> matanya: but /etc/resolv.conf doesn't reflect
[08:37] <dhruvasagar> matanya: it still doesn't list the dns servers I added...
[08:37] <matanya> why not add them directly?
[08:37] <dhruvasagar> matanya: because I want them to be added to any network that I connect to...
[08:37] <Phoenixxl> though on one side I apreciate google giving us servers for free, I can't help but be disgusted at the amount of data gathering on a person that goes on through their dns's
[08:37] <dhruvasagar> this used to work earlier
[08:38] <matanya> dhruvasagar: what is in /etc/resolv.conf?
[08:38] <dhruvasagar> Phoenixxl: well there are several alternatives
[08:38] <Phoenixxl> For my own sanity , even if they're not always the fastest , I do keep using my ISP's
[08:38] <dhruvasagar> matanya: just 'nameserver 127.0.0.1'
[08:39] <Phoenixxl> thid id just azn observation , has nothing to do with the issiue thats being resolved here
[08:39] <ObrienDave> Phoenixxl, unless you're a hermit that can survive on cash, get used to it
[08:39] <matanya> if you add 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' won't it be solved?
[08:39] <dhruvasagar> Phoenixxl: that's the whole point of 'prepending' dns servers. I am not changing them, just prepending extra one's, the ISP dns servers will still be there
[08:39] <histo> dhruvasagar: add them to /etc/network/interfaces as dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8 whatever.... man resolvconf  shows the "new way"
[08:39] <Phoenixxl> oh i have them as 3rd and 4th as well :)
[08:39] <Phoenixxl> i'm just saying
[08:40] <dhruvasagar> matanya: it will be, but /etc/resolve.conf will be regenerated once I reconnect
[08:40] <Phoenixxl> there's worse than google out there as well
[08:40] <dhruvasagar> matanya: just changing /etc/resolve.conf is a temporary solution...I want it permanent :)
[08:40] <matanya> i see what you are trying to achieve
[08:40] <Phoenixxl> sign of the times n stuff
[08:40] <histo> dhruvasagar: then add them to /etc/network/interfaces as I suggested
[08:40] <dhruvasagar> histo: ahh that sounds like a solution, thanks checking
[08:40] <[nas]peter> Could there be something like SecureBoot that is fucking up?
[08:41] <histo> !language | [nas]peter
[08:41] <ubottu> [nas]peter: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional.
[08:41] <dhruvasagar> hehe
[08:41] <histo> [nas]peter: where do you see the IO errors?
[08:41] <ObrienDave> Phoenixxl, something for you to think about... if you buy something on credit, by the time you get the card in your wallet, "big brother" knows EXACTLY what you bought and where you are. LMAO
[08:41] <matanya> [nas]peter: hdd has nothing to do with secureboot
[08:41] <maum> can someone download the files in mirror.emulab.net/cygwin ?
[08:41] <Phoenixxl> I do know <unconvertable>
[08:42] <histo> maum: What does that have to do with ubuntu?
[08:42] <Phoenixxl> I worked as a programmer & sys admin in a small local bank
[08:42] <ObrienDave> *bites tongue*
[08:42] <maum> histo: I tried to download that files on ubuntu by wget but it cannot be downloaded.
[08:43] <histo> maum: then try a different mirror
[08:43] <histo> maum: also why would you be downloading cygwin files on linux?
[08:43] <Phoenixxl> back in the day credit checks were done with dial up , there was a special bbs dedicate dto tit .. you give in a name , and a 8 digit code comes out
[08:43] <Phoenixxl> very creepy
[08:44] <maum> histo: there is a long story .. and there is no other mirror. but I can download the files from web. but there are a bunch of files.
[08:44] <[nas]peter> matanya, it might not have anything to do with it, but the IO was good on Windows 7
[08:44] <histo> maum: what wget command are you trying?
[08:44] <Phoenixxl> it is here.. but I try to avoid it where i still can .. i'm under no illusion i can completelkyt avoid it
[08:44] <[nas]peter> now I get ~9MB/s
[08:45] <ObrienDave> maum, i can D/L them. what's the problem?
[08:45] <histo> [nas]peter: ahh the speed not IO errors
[08:45] <histo> [nas]peter: what was the speed in m$?
[08:45] <matanya> [nas]peter: it is all other thing
[08:45] <maum> histo: wget mirror.emulab.net/cygwin
[08:45] <ObrienDave> maum, i can D/L them. what's the problem?
[08:46] <[nas]peter> histo, I used a dd command to measure the speed
[08:46] <maum> ObrienDave:  you can download all of them?
[08:46] <histo> maum: that's a html page so yes I can cl cygwin
[08:46] <ObrienDave> maum, i got the setup file and the .ini file
[08:46] <Phoenixxl> as for credit.. i'm one of those old timers that , if I want something really expensive , I put some money aside till i have enough .. *gasp*
[08:47] <[nas]peter> I also ran that test in a VM on windows
[08:47] <[nas]peter> and it got 90MB/s
[08:47] <kishy> hey
[08:47] <maum> ObrienDave: there are many files in release folder so.. I want it all.
[08:47] <bestdnd> how can i enlarge my swap file?
[08:47] <Phoenixxl> bestdnd it's a partition on linux
[08:47] <ObrienDave> then run the setup, and THEN D/L the rest of the files
[08:48] <Phoenixxl> if you have free space on your hd is's easy as pie
[08:48] <histo> maum: wget
[08:48] <Phoenixxl> if not you'll have to resize n stull .. i wouldn't recommend it unless youve done it before.. on a non critical system
[08:48] <bestdnd> can i do it on my secondary HD?
[08:48] <Phoenixxl> bestdnd, sure
[08:48] <maum> histo: can you download them by wget?
[08:48] <histo> maum:
[08:48] <histo>   maum wget  mirror.emulab.net/cygwin/setup.exe
[08:49] <dhruvasagar> histo: thanks, it works :)
[08:49] <Phoenixxl> bestdnd, if you have free spacs in the form of non partitioned room
[08:49] <maum> histo: there are other file except for setup.exe
[08:49] <bestdnd> no, i need to resize my partitions for it
[08:50] <maum> histo: http://mirror.emulab.net/cygwin/release/
[08:50] <Phoenixxl> there are ways ... but they're a bit iffy ..
[08:51] <Phoenixxl> you can DD zeroes to a file ..
[08:51] <histo> maum: http doesn't support globbing
[08:51] <Phoenixxl> then mlkswap the file
[08:51] <Phoenixxl> then swapon the file
[08:51] <Phoenixxl> i meant mkswap not mlk
[08:51] <maum> histo: i don't understand
[08:51] <bestdnd> is there a manual for it? i don't know all these commands
[08:52] <Phoenixxl> let me see
[08:52] <matanya> !swap
[08:52] <ubottu> swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info

[08:52] <histo> matanya: try wget -m http://mirror.emulab.net/cygwin
[08:52] <bestdnd> thanks
[08:52] <vadmeste> Hello everybody. I have Ubuntu 12.04 and I cannot find fsck.ext2 though e2fslibs package is installed. Is that normal ?
[08:53] <histo> maum: try wget -m http://mirror.emulab.net/cygwin
[08:53] <Phoenixxl> it's not a very good solution though .. since evey call goes over your filesystem as well
[08:54] <histo> maum: you can add -k if you want to fix the links within the html pages that it dl's during the mirror process but that will get all your files you want. It mirrors the site.
[08:54] <Phoenixxl> bestdnd, the next hdd you put in , reserve some swap on it
[08:54] <histo> bestdnd: you can resize your current swap or make a swapfile the choice is yours
[08:54] <[nas]peter> It seems like my hardware besides the disk can't be the issue: http://pastie.org/7973051
[08:54] <maum> histo: Thanks, it works.
[08:55] <[nas]peter> my PC has SATA3

[09:02] <[nas]peter> histo, that's everything except read/write
[09:02] <histo> [nas]peter: yes and what kind of IO do you expect to see?
[09:02] <[nas]peter> at least 60MB/s
[09:03] <histo> [nas]peter: how are you testing?
[09:03] <[nas]peter> http://pastie.org/7973123
[09:03] <histo> [nas]peter: change you block size
[09:03] <histo> s/you/your/
[09:04] <histo> [nas]peter: Increase it to like 1M
[09:04] <[nas]peter> histo, would removing SWAP also help?
[09:05] <histo> [nas]peter: I have no idea what sort of cache your drive is using. You'd have to look at the label. Typically modern disks are around a 2MB cache size. You are only writing 8k to the cache then it writes to the disk then gets another 8k etc... that is slowing down your IO using bs=8k
[09:05] <histo> [nas]peter: swap has nothing to do with your "test"
[09:06] <histo> [nas]peter: dd is not an effective test of IO performance unless you specify a bs that is equal to your cache size. I would use another tool if you don't understand.
[09:07] <parapan> hello folks; I'm using 12.04 - is there any ad-hoc webserver I can setup in ubuntu ?
[09:07] <histo> [nas]peter: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1198691/testing-io-performance-in-linux
[09:07] <matanya> parapan: apache
[09:07] <histo> parapan: what do you mean by "ad-hoc"?
[09:07] <parapan> basically i want to share some files which are larger for e-mail - 20-30 Mb
[09:08] <parapan> matanya: this is not quite with one click is it ?
[09:08] <parapan> histo
[09:08] <matanya> no, it isn't parapan
[09:08] <[nas]peter> histo, and using: System > Administration > Disk utility menu
[09:08] <DJones> parapan: If there's not too many files, have you thought about using Ubuntu One or Dropbox, both of them have a couple of GB's f storage space
[09:08] <parapan> histo: something like filezilla let's say . . . .just click , open a program and share a file .....like a FPT server ....
[09:09] <histo> parapan: what are you sharing to? windows boxes or linux boxes?
[09:10] <parapan> DJones: didn't knew about them ....just want to share few files once per month . . .
[09:10] <parapan> histo: windows quite sure
[09:10] <histo> parapan: ifyou have python installed "python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]"
[09:10] <ObrienDave> Google Drive gives you 5GB free
[09:11] <parapan> matanya: k, you're correct, I was mistaking ....thinking on a webserver only for sharing 2-3 files ...it's not worted ..
[09:11] <ObrienDave> sorry people, bed time. good nite all
[09:11] <DJones> parapan: Dropbox should do that quite easily, just create an account, install the the app on each machine (windows and linux clients) log in and it creates a folder on each machine that you can drop files into & they'll be duplicated on each machine when they're logged in
=== iDangerMouse is now known as iDM|Afk
[09:12] <histo> parapan: you should have python by default the command I gave you will start an HTTP server in the current directory so they can pull the files at the specified port.
[09:13] <parapan> histo: cool > but what will be the web address to access ???
[09:13] <parapan> DJones: thanks - it sound cool and i'll look into it ..but they want to pick up the files not to install softwares and stuff ...
[09:13] <histo> parapan: your IP address:port
[09:14] <histo> parapan: unless you do port 80 then they could just go to your IP and see the content. Is this for just local sharing or out over the internets?
[09:14] <matanya> parapan: you need to allow it your router if your
[09:14] <matanya> *if you have
[09:15] <parapan> histo: i'll try that > is over internet
[09:15] <parapan> matanya: if i'm using 80 i wont need that correct ?
[09:15] <matanya> you will need forwarding
[09:15] <histo> parapan: well you could get a free url name from places like dyndns.org or others and point it at your IP. But if you are gonig to go through all that drama for a simple http server that you are going to put up and take down etc...?
[09:16] <histo> parapan: if you want something more permanent... I would definately setup apache and a URL. Control access with .htaccess files etc...
=== AlexanderM_Away is now known as AlexanderM
[09:17] <DJones> parapan: Another to consider with a web server, do you have a fixed ip address? If not you'll probably need to use something like dyndns to give a fixed address for people to connect to which then goes to whatever your ip address is, that would need to be set to update if your ip address changed
[09:20] <parapan> DJones: histo: I have the permanent webserver setup with apache only not handy at the moment ....I want an extremely fast way to share a file which can be downloaded most easily via http or ftp ....
=== harry is now known as Guest5980
[09:20] <cristian_c> Hi
[09:21] <parapan> and maybe I can use teamviewer also ...for file transfer ...but this lwill require the install on the other PC ....
[09:21] <cristian_c> How can I switch audio from mono to stereo?
[09:21] <histo> parapan: well the temporary way with python is one option. The other option is using scp over ssh
[09:21] <cristian_c> any ideas?
[09:21] <histo> parapan: or sftp.
[09:22] <histo> parapan: basically if you want to share a file in directory /home/parapan/good_stuff  you just cd /home/parapan/good_stuff  then python -m SimpleHTTPServer   and it will start up an http server in that directory so they can pull the file. When done just hit ctrl+c to stop the server
[09:23] <histo> parapan: You need to setup port forwarding on your router to whatever port you are going to use like 8000 or 80 pointed at your internal IP address. So then they just go to yourpublic.ip:8000  or whatever and can see your files.
[09:23] <histo> parapan: portforward.com
[09:23] <histo> cristian_c: what type of audio file?
[09:24] <histo> parapan: there are many options python -m one should only be used as just a quick dirty http server to share a file then take it down.
[09:24] <SarcasticGoats> Does anyone know how to make the xrandr command run at startup?
[09:24] <histo> SarcasticGoats: create a /etc/xorg.conf
[09:25] <histo> SarcasticGoats: actually /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:25] <cristian_c> histo, all the audio files
[09:25] <histo> cristian_c: You only have mono audio coming from your system?
[09:25] <cristian_c> histo, yes
[09:25] <SarcasticGoats> Histo: When I try xorg -configure it says fatal server error
[09:25] <histo> cristian_c: are your speakers plugged in all the way?
[09:25] <cristian_c> I don't know why
[09:26] <cristian_c> histo, i've got an headphone out
[09:26] <histo> !xorg.conf | SarcasticGoats
[09:26] <ubottu> SarcasticGoats: The /etc/X11/xorg.conf file is deprecated, but sometimes may still be needed to pass values to specific drivers.

[09:26] <cristian_c> histo, but nothing works
[09:26] <cristian_c> :(
[09:26] <SarcasticGoats> cristian_c: Sometimes if your speaker plug isn't fully inserted into the jack then you'll only get mono
[09:26] <parapan> histo: exactly my aim ....for 20 minutes up then, down forever :D; yes, I'll need the port forwarding for sure unless I'll have a static IP; one more q - what will be the default folder for the shared files ???
[09:26] <histo> cristian_c: check by right clicking on the volume icon and going to sound properties make sure it's set to stereo duplex or whatever.
[09:27] <parapan> histo: you said something to release command python directly on the folder where the shared files are ??/
[09:27] <cristian_c> SarcasticGoats, the plug is fully inserted
[09:27] <histo> parapan: whatever directory you are in when you execute python -m SimpleHTTPServer will be served
[09:27] <histo> cristian_c: check sound properties
[09:27] <cristian_c> histo, in pavucontrol, duplex analog stereo is selected
[09:28] <histo> cristian_c: are you headphones broken?
[09:29] <cristian_c> histo, no
[09:29] <histo> cristian_c: check your left and right levels in alsamixer or some other mixer.
[09:30] <parapan> histo: how do you close python ?
[09:30] <histo> parapan: ctrl+c
[09:30] <gotwig> Please help me :( My networkusername changed for NetworkManager, and I am not anymore able to login with the new one :(   my new username is something like bg\username , my old username was username
[09:31] <gotwig> When I check the NetworkManager profile, it says even my username is bg\\username !!
[09:31] <gotwig> but it should use simply bg\username
[09:31] <gotwig> it cant use that, why?!
[09:31] <cristian_c> histo, I don't see strange things
[09:31] <cristian_c> histo, in alsmixer

[09:32] <parapan> histo: a little complication : the requested url cannot be retrieved ..error 10001
[09:32] <histo> parapan: huh?
[09:32] <cristian_c> histo, left and right are at the same level in pavucontrol
[09:32] <gotwig> My simple question is: Why is NetworkManager not able to transmit my username in this form ?! "bg\username" ??
[09:32] <cristian_c> histo, laptop
[09:32] <[nas]peter> I ran Iometer and that says I have 106MB/s
[09:32] <[nas]peter> as average
[09:32] <parapan> histo: cannot be reached from internet
[09:32] <histo> parapan: did you setup the port forward?
[09:33] <histo> [nas]peter: okay so what's the problem?
[09:33] <histo> cristian_c: try the built in speakers are those in stereo?
[09:33] <parapan> yeap > on port 81 ...let me try another port
[09:33] <[nas]peter> histo, when I run apt-get update, my PC nearly crashes and all programs become darker and are non-responsive
[09:33] <gotwig> what is the best alternative to NetworkManager ?
[09:33] <matanya> gotwig: wicd
[09:33] <cristian_c> histo, I've tried headphones and external speakers
[09:33] <histo> gotwig: second wicd
[09:34] <histo> !sound | cristian_c I have no idea but try some of this
[09:34] <ubottu> cristian_c I have no idea but try some of this: If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
[09:34] <cristian_c> histo, I don't understand if the builtin speakers are working
[09:34] <gotwig> does wicd support every thing that NetworkManager does?
[09:34] <gotwig> what about WPA2 Enterprise Wifi access points via username and password?
[09:34] <histo> cristian_c: Perhaps a wire is loose on the jack
[09:34] <cristian_c> histo, I'll try to read these pages
[09:34] <SarcasticGoats> histo: Is there an easy guide for setting up the resolution bit of xorg.conf
[09:35] <parapan> histo: same issue : however ....the python is saying serving HTTP server on 0.0.0.0 on port 81 .......shouldn't 0.0.0.0 be the local IP ???
[09:35] <histo> gotwig: yes and there is a curses interface and applet it's up to you which you want to use.
[09:35] <SarcasticGoats> Histo: Never mind I've found one I tik
[09:35] <SarcasticGoats> Think*
[09:35]  * gotwig is very depressed. Ubuntu is so broken ...
[09:36] <histo> parapan: if you are using a port under 1000 you will need to use sudo
[09:37] <histo> parapan: actually anything below 1024 I believe.
[09:37] <parapan> histo: course I'm using sudo
[09:37] <histo> parapan: try browsing on that machine to http://localhost:portnumber
[09:39] <parapan> histo: you're the man ....the port number was too low :d
[09:39] <parapan> with the sudo it didn't worked
[09:39] <hanwentao> is there a way to select a mirror manually during installation?
[09:40] <histo> parapan: yeah anything under 1024 requires root permissions.   that's odd that with sudo it wouldn't work. Perhaps sudo -i python -m ... would work
[09:40] <parapan> histo: made the setup on port 8000 and it's working like a rocket :D
[09:40] <[nas]peter> histo, http://pastie.org/7973270
[09:40] <histo> parapan: Yeah just use port 8000 then on your router forward port 80 to port 8000 of your internal ip
[09:40] <histo> parapan: then anyone that has your IP can get those files quickly
[09:40] <squaregoldfish> gotwig: Apparently it does, but I've never used it myself.
[09:41] <histo> [nas]peter: lol what?
[09:41] <parapan> histo: I guess I should get to root first ....and after that to launch the webserver ...anyway million thanks I have learned something today from the community :D
[09:41] <histo> gotwig: ubuntu inst browken
[09:41] <[nas]peter> I timed the IO
[09:41] <histo> parapan: yeah you can use any python module from cli like that with the -m switch
[09:41] <gotwig> histo: too many stuff is not working. too many, just saying
[09:42] <parapan> histo: i recently moved from 10.4 to 12.04 do you know the reason for using Libre office now instead ooo ?
[09:42] <histo> parapan: OO forked
[09:42] <parapan> histo: first I have to know what python is ;)
[09:42] <histo> gotwig: Like what?
[09:43] <parapan> histo: "forked" ? meaning
[09:43] <histo> gotwig: It works for millions of people. Just because you are experiencing problems does not mean it's broken for all.
[09:43] <gotwig> histo: you have no idea
[09:43] <histo> parapan: the project split into two. Open Office is still there and there is LibreOffice which is a fork of it.
[09:44] <gotwig> every operating system is somehow broken
[09:44] <gotwig> and window is the most broken one
[09:44] <[nas]peter> histo, my disk has 23mb cache
[09:44] <histo> gotwig: well perhaps your definition of broken is different from 99% of the world.
[09:44] <parapan> histo: aaaa ...just like a fork with 3 "fingers"
[09:44] <histo> parapan: like a fork in the road

[10:48] <ShapeShifter499> hi
[10:51] <emka> Hi, using 10.04 LTS, how should update just the security updates?
[10:51] <cfhowlett> emka, as it's not longer supported ... can't
[10:51] <emka> is this enough?
[10:51] <emka> sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades
[10:51] <emka> sudo unattended-upgrade
[10:51] <thunder1212> E: /var/cache/apt/archives/libcapi20-3_1%3a3.25+dfsg1-3wheezy1+6.0trisquel1_i386.deb: './usr/share/doc/libcapi20-3/changelog.Debian.gz' is different from the same file on the system
[10:51] <thunder1212> I got this error while installing wine on my system am suing 64bit
[10:51] <cfhowlett> emka, it's end of life, i.e. no longer supported
[10:52] <emka> ok
[10:52] <emka> so what should I do then?
[10:52] <cfhowlett> emka, upgrade to 12.04 is my recommendation.
[10:52] <emka> ouch...
[10:52] <cfhowlett> emka, is this a server?
[10:52] <emka> yes
[10:53] <emka> running a couple of web apps
[10:53] <cfhowlett> emka, consider your options.  IMHO, running a non-supported public facing server lacking supported/updates is inadvisable
[10:54] <emka> yes
[10:54] <emka> it is not mine tho...
=== RootXS is now known as cjsarette
[10:54] <emka> but I've been asked to check for what to do
[10:55] <emka> Is it "safe" to just do do-release-upgrade
[10:55] <emka> feels like that could give us a lot of problems
[10:55] <cfhowlett> emka, personally, I'd torrent 12.04, burn or USB the ISO and clean install.
[10:56] <emka> ok
[11:00] <hs_> hello , in unity-greeter , is there a specific size for the logo or any size i want ?
[11:01] <silv3r_m00n> hi there, I got 2 adsl connections (that are put into 2 routers) can I use both ? (http://askubuntu.com/questions/299018/using-multiple-internet-connections-on-ubuntu) ?
[11:01] <emka> cfhowlett: ok...and reinstall/configure everything from scratch again... :) I don't use muppet
[11:01] <emka> Puppt*
[11:01] <cfhowlett> emka, wait
[11:02] <cfhowlett> emka, if you have your /home in a dedicated partition, you just install the system files and reinstall your apps.  your configurations will then be retained
[11:02] <cfhowlett> emka, just don't format the /home and you're good
[11:03] <hs_> hello , in unity-greeter , is there a specific size for the logo or any size i want ?
[11:03] <emka> yeah but not all apache/ruby stuff I guess
[11:04] <cfhowlett> emka, pretty sure there's a way to retain those settings ... ask in #ubuntu-server
[11:06] <fractaline> cfhowlett, can one move /home to a separate partition in preparation for clean install?
[11:06] <petervonfrosta> tvoss ping
[11:06] <gordonjcp> fractaline: yes
[11:06] <petervonfrosta> tvoss, ping
[11:07] <emka> ok
[11:07] <cfhowlett> fractaline, you can setup a /home and THEN clean install ...
[11:07] <emka> cfhowlett: Thanks! I think I have to do some reading first
[11:07] <cfhowlett> emka, best of luck.

[11:10] <cfhowlett> fractaline, see http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome
[11:10] <cfhowlett> guest55555_, greetings
[11:10] <fractaline> i am running kubuntu 13.04 (which is really kubuntu-desktop installed on ubuntu) i'd like to do a clean install of 13.04 64bit...  looking for the best way
[11:11] <fractaline> cfhowlett, i'll have a look     ty
[11:12] <cfhowlett> fractaline, make your /home, torrent 13.04, make a boot usb/cdrom and install
[11:12] <guest55555_> During an installation of Ubuntu when creating LVMs - is there a way to specify GiB instead of GB? "df -h" looks so ugly after specifying "10G" during installation (as the LVM only has 9.31GiB).
[11:12] <guest55555_> Or any workaround to really have 10GiB?
[11:12] <fractaline> you mean make an empty /home??
[11:13] <hillary> what command can i use to move from one directory to another ubuntu 12.04
[11:13] <fractaline> fine for future use but how about saving settings?
[11:13] <cfhowlett> fractaline, no I meant, as in the previous link, make a dedicated /home and move your files there.  Also, back up.  of course.  then install
[11:13] <cfhowlett> hillary, cd
[11:13] <fractaline> i see
[11:13] <cfhowlett> hillary, eeks.  no.  I think it's cp
[11:14] <Leighton> hillary: cd directoryname
[11:14] <hillary> i want to move from pwd to Downloads
[11:14] <cfhowlett> Leighton, and to move the files?
[11:16] <hillary> cd /Downloads i get  bash cd: /Downloads: No such files or Directory
[11:16] <Leighton> hillary: ohhhh, I thought you meant move like change "location". cp will copy files, not move them

[11:24] <hillary> i run update and see what might happened
[11:24] <cfhowlett> hillary, error message?  and what exact command did your urn
[11:24] <hillary> cd ~/Downloads
[11:24] <cfhowlett> raincode, 10.04 is end of life.  not sure you want to learn programming on an unsupported OS ....
[11:25] <hillary> bash: cd: /home/hillary/Downloads: No such file or directory when i run  cd ~/Downloads
[11:25] <cfhowlett> hillary, so, just for fun, try with sudo ...
[11:25] <raincode> cfhowlett, what your mean about "10.04 is end of life"?
[11:26] <cfhowlett> !eol|raincode,
[11:26] <ubottu> raincode,: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[11:26] <raincode> cfhowlett, what you mean about "10.04 is end of life"?
[11:26] <auronandace> raincode: 10.04 is no longer supoorted on the desktop
[11:26] <cfhowlett> raincode, 10.04 was supported for 3 years on the desktop ...
[11:27] <raincode> so, what can i do ?,what i must use?
[11:27] <KyouReeus4nfo> gcc
[11:28] <cfhowlett> raincode, update to 12.04 is my recommendation ...
[11:28] <fractaline> cfhowlett,  what size is recommendable for the /home partition?
[11:28] <cfhowlett> fractaline, depends on your own use.  look at what you have currently and take your best guess as to future needs
[11:28] <fractaline> fair enough
[11:29] <hillary> even with sudo it has not work
[11:29] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all

[11:29] <jnaour> Hi, I have a strange problem: I use a project name ElasticSearch and I want to allow more Java Heap Space to it. So I do a "bin/elasticsearch -f -Xmx4g -Xms4g", but it doesn't work. When I launch the exact same command in root mode it works, there is 4g allowed to ElasticSearch JVM. Is there some perms configuration that could limit the memory that I can allow to it in user mode?
[11:29] <BluesKaj> hey fractaline
[11:30] <raincode> cfhowleft, you recomend me to update, that mean i must update from ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04 OR i remove ubuntu 10.04 then install new to 12.04??
[11:30] <jnaour> named*
[11:30] <cfhowlett> raincode, no need to remove anything.  torrent 12.04, make a boot usb/cdrom and clean install.  OR you could try direct upgrade assuming your software sources are set to LTS only
[11:31] <auronandace> raincode: up to you (i prefer a fresh install, less can go wrong)
[11:31] <cfhowlett> raincode, but I'd definitely go with torrent/clean install rather than software upgrade
[11:31] <handuel> raincode: ignoring 10.04 being EOL, this is the same in all versions sudo apt-get install binutils build-essential to install the compiler. Hello world program #include <stdio.h> int main(int argc, char* argv[]){printf("Hello\n"); return 0;} to compile gcc nameofcfile.c -o test to run ./test
[11:32] <cfhowlett> handuel, true but he's learning coding ... on an unsupported OS.  Just don't seem right, somehow.
[11:33] <handuel> cfhowlett: yes, but I'm just answering his question, he should still update, but I'm saying that is what he should do, on any version, even once he updates
[11:33] <cfhowlett> handuel, understood.  thanks for clarifying
[11:33] <cfhowlett> handuel, and that's a sweet bit of coding you wrote
[11:34] <handuel> cfhowlett: sarcasm?
[11:34] <guest55555_> Noone that can help with my LVM/GiB/GB question? :-)
[11:34] <cfhowlett> handuel, not the least.
[11:34] <KyouReeus4nfo> I would just do echo Hello
[11:34] <cfhowlett> !cookie|handuel,
[11:34] <ubottu> handuel,: Wow! You're such a great helper, you deserve a cookie!
[11:35] <handuel> Thanks :)
[11:35] <handuel> guest55555_ if you click something else when installing, can't you just manually set the partition size
[11:36] <guest55555_> i *can* specify 10G - but this will by 10 gigabyte and not 10 gibibyte

[11:36] <raincode> handuel, thx for your code in C. i'm usually using python, but i want to learn high to low programming language as C, but assembly i delay its caused i want learn one by one.
[11:36] <raincode> cfhowleft thx for your sugestion
[11:37] <cfhowlett> raincode, best of luck
[11:37] <raincode> maybe if i have time, i thinking about your solution
[11:37] <handuel> raincode: fair enough, quite obviously there are more human readable ways of writing that, (new lines and indentation and such, however all on one line would work.)
[11:38] <raincode> for all , i'm so sorry if my english is not good,so i just to try communication with you all here

[11:40] <DJones> ichat: To restart X?
[11:40] <ichat> DJones,  yes
[11:41] <DJones> ichat: There is an option in one of the system setting to enable that, give me a minute to see if I can find it
[11:41] <handuel> settings->keyboard->shortcuts->system edit logout to be ctrl+alt+backspace
[11:41] <hillary> something wrong with nu cd command ubuntu 12.04
[11:41] <DJones> ichat: See what handuel They got it

[11:48] <raincode> sir, can give me sugestion , priority language that we must learn in ubuntu?
[11:48] <raincode> c or python?
[11:49] <scotty^> hillary - You want cd $HOME/Downloads
[11:49] <hillary> yes
[11:50] <scotty^> ichat - that way you can still really logout via the keyboard and zap the xserver

[11:57] <handuel> how fr*ggin clever is that bot, how does it realise that information wasn't given :D
[11:57] <raincode> not old, travelmate 4020
[11:57] <bsk> hillary: remember that you must have write permissions on the destination folder
[11:58] <ActionParsnip> bsk: or use sudo, easier
[11:58] <ichat> handuel,  -   log-off is not the same as restarting the x server  specially not forcefully...  the reason for wanting ctrl+at+backspace was   that i had a game that crashed and set my  unity resolution to  640x480 ... and    i coul not even see the top pannel any more...
[11:58] <handuel> ichat: use alt+sysrq+k then
[11:58] <jrib> handuel: probably safe to assume that's always the case ;)
[11:58] <NewUbuntu007> Thanks - handuel, ActionParsnip, cfhowlett and ubottu. The problem is when I connect to internet from my Ubuntu computer, I am not able to connect via the network cable. I used the same physical connection with my Windows machine and it works.
[11:59] <ichat> what is  sysrq?
[11:59] <ActionParsnip> NewUbuntu007: can you ping your routr's internal IP?
[11:59] <bsk> ActionParsnip: whatever..
[11:59] <handuel> a key on your keyboard, often on the same thing as print-screen, you might have to hold fn or similar to be able to use it.
[11:59] <ActionParsnip> ichat: or run:  killall -u $USER     same deal :)
[11:59] <NewUbuntu007> ActionParnsnip - Yes, its 10.8.233.150

[12:02] <raincode> i want to migrate total from xp to unix.for this time my condition: C:\\ <<==xp,.(ntfs)  D:\\<<==ubuntu but with wubi.exe shown:4 virtual disk,  . can we change ubuntu wubi version, to ubuntu totality in D:\\??
[12:02] <RedBlade7> hi
[12:02] <NewUbuntu007> ActionParsnip: (Curious question) What does it mean when we ping 8.8.8.8?
[12:02] <RedBlade7> i set up kubuntu
[12:03] <RedBlade7> and then tried to install the amd drivers via the menu
[12:03] <ActionParsnip> NewUbuntu007: its a IP outside of your LAN
[12:03] <RedBlade7> but now it says "unsupported hardware" and locks up
[12:03] <gordonjcp> raincode: You'd need to remove the D: partition, Unix doesn't use MSDOS drives
[12:03] <ichat> hmmmm,
[12:03] <rahmspinat_of_do> NewUbuntu007: its googles dns server which is a very prominent ip that is propably always up
[12:03] <ActionParsnip> NewUbuntu007: does it reply?
[12:03] <RedBlade7> (there were two of them listed, i must've picked the wrong one)
[12:03] <RedBlade7> so now i cant boot
[12:03] <RedBlade7> how do i boot into text mode?
[12:03] <RedBlade7> recovery console forces read-only
[12:03] <RedBlade7> so i cant do anything
[12:04] <RedBlade7> also, there's no xorg.conf
[12:04] <ActionParsnip> RedBlade7: hold SHIFT at boot and boot to root recovery mode, then run:  mount -o rw,remount /
[12:04] <RedBlade7> i'm a slackware person so am good with the command line
[12:04] <NewUbuntu007> ActionParsnip: No
[12:04] <ActionParsnip> RedBlade7: so it may mount readonly but yuo can remount it writable
[12:04] <RedBlade7> ok
[12:04] <ActionParsnip> NewUbuntu007: so you can png your router but not outside? correct?
[12:04] <RedBlade7> also, where is the xorg.conf on kubuntu?
[12:05] <RedBlade7> it's not in /etc/X11
[12:05] <handuel> RedBlade7: no xorg by default now, use recovery mode from grub menu to access console, and as actionparsnip has stated, remount fs'es
[12:05] <NewUbuntu007> ActionParsnip: I will confirm that in a minute.
[12:05] <RedBlade7> hmm
[12:05] <RedBlade7> ok i'll try and get in to remove the packages
[12:05] <raincode> gordonjcp: my condition now, i'm on ubuntu that boot from d:\\wubi.exe, . can from here(from my condition) i change my root,home,usr,an other,..manualy
[12:05] <RedBlade7> will it boot properly once the proprietary packages are removed?
[12:05] <RedBlade7> go back to the nouveau
[12:06] <minixvm> raincode: wubi is no longer supported
[12:06] <NewUbuntu007> ActionParsnip: Actually, I dont know the answer to your question.
[12:06] <handuel> RedBlade7, should do yes. (BTW good luck, I had the exact same issue a few years ago, massive pain in the proverbial arse, luckily actionparsnip helped me through it :))
[12:06] <NewUbuntu007> ActionParsnip: I only did "ifconfig -a" and I got 'inet addr' as 10.8.33.150

[12:14] <kisya> is there a kernel package with pf patches applied?
[12:14] <handuel> raincode: and then use live installation media to install to the ext4 partition
[12:15] <raincode> if i have to do that(have format G to ext4),; can manually i'm copy my system from D:\ to G:\?
[12:15] <ichat> ActionParsnip,  - the command   killall -u $user   seams not to work.  so than i tried in a terminal   echo  $user   and i get a blank line   shouldn't  my logged on user be be printed with that command
[12:15] <minixvm> raincode: not from windows no
[12:15] <handuel> ichat echo $USER
[12:16] <raincode> from ubuntu, isn't it?
[12:16] <handuel> raincode: indeed
[12:16] <handuel> raincode: use the gparted program
[12:16] <minixvm> raincode: just perform a new install, forget copying a wubi install to a new one
[12:17] <Nilyth> Hi there
[12:18] <ActionParsnip> ichat: the word user is in caps, that's why I gave it in caps
[12:18] <ActionParsnip> ichat: you cannot change case of commands jusyt because you feel like it, things will not work
[12:19] <Nilyth> is there someone used with codeblocks and libsx?
[12:19] <cfhowlett> Nilyth, greetings
[12:19] <Nilyth> Hi o/
[12:20] <Nilyth> I'm a real newbie on the linux environement :(
[12:20] <raincode> for this time, i don't have ubuntu in cd.just have iso in drive. my burn cd-rw the function is error. so , that i can do?,i'm now in Ubuntu10.04 system.after i format g:\\ can i move my filesystem ubuntu manually using copy paste?,and how to configuration boot file?
[12:20] <handuel> raincode: I just thought, I don't know if this will work, so correct me if I'm wrong guys, but you may be able to format G:\ then install ubiquity on your current ubuntu, and use that to install to the partition
[12:20] <ActionParsnip> raincode: did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
[12:21] <minixvm> Nilyth: codeblocks is in the repos
[12:21] <handuel> ActionParsnip: think he's saying his disk drive actually has a hardware issue...
[12:21] <ActionParsnip> handuel: oic
[12:21] <Nilyth> ahah
[12:21] <Nilyth> I just need a compiler compatible with libsx :(
[12:22] <ichat> ActionParsnip,  soryr man  :P
[12:22] <minixvm> raincode: you can use a usb if your cd drive doesn't work
[12:22] <ActionParsnip> ichat: run commands as given, or unless instructed. You'll have fewer issues
[12:22] <handuel> raincode: the ubiquity solution that I suggested will not copy/paste your configuration, it will make a new one, so do backup any docs you want to copy across
[12:22] <handuel> minivm: his BIOS can't boot from USB :D
[12:23] <foofoobar> I underestimated how long gparted needs to shrink my 400gb partition to 300gb.. Its working since 4 hours now :|
[12:23] <ActionParsnip> handuel: is there a floppy drive?
[12:23] <raincode> ok sir, so for resume this problem,after i'm format g:\\, then install ubiquity. after install it, using ubiquity i use my ubuntu10.04.iso and give destination to g:\\?

[12:27] <raincode> "backup any docs you want to copy across", in my current condition, if i have install in g:\\ and backup current d:\\ubuntu, can for temporary, i not remove d:\\ubuntu, so after installation we have 3 boot, (xp,current ubuntu in d:\\,and new ubuntu in g:)
[12:29] <handuel> raincode: yes, however when you install ubuntu in G:, it will use the ubuntu bootloader (grub), that won't recognise an installation within windows (wubi), so you won't be able to boot it any more

[13:00] <adamk> pr0n: What do you mean by disabling that GPU? What is your end goal here?
[13:00] <carpediembaby> how can i make 13.04 to look for proprietary drivers?
[13:01] <aguitel> carpediembaby, what driver?
=== GingerGeek[Away] is now known as GingerGeek
[13:02] <carpediembaby> aguitel: i was just asking about a problem with display. i fixed it with nomodeset. but it looks awefull
[13:02] <adamk> carpediembaby: If a proprietary driver is available and packaged for/by Ubuntu, it would show up under "Additional drivers"
[13:02] <Dr_willis> normally intel drivers/chipsets shouldent need nomodeset. they should just work.
[13:02] <adamk> Disabling KMS is generally not a good idea.
[13:03] <cfhowlett> *normally*
[13:03] <pr0n> due to my ati card my laptop gets heated alot, alot.. and there is over consumption of battery too.. so i want to stop it
[13:03] <Dr_willis> Intel drivers wouldent be shown in the  addational-drivers tool.
[13:03] <carpediembaby> adamk, Dr_willis : it is an intel chipset
[13:03] <b3rz3rk3r> I've just compiled fwbackups to run automated incremental backups in addition to my weekly disk images. Which folders should I be backing up on my OS install drive?
[13:03] <adamk> carpediembaby: Then there are no proprietary drivers.
[13:04] <rupert> Hi guys, I'm running LVM with some USB disks connected to a USB hub. Sometimes this hub resets which causes ubuntu to see the disks as new (they are given an increasing name, sdb instead of sda etc.) This messes up LVM because whenever I try to access a directory on the LVM I get an input/output error. Is there any way I can make the names persistent? I tried looking at udev but I'm not sure how to identify the disks (I tried by USB bus but that didn't
[13:04] <Dr_willis> carpediembaby,  intel makes a lot of differnet video chipsets. there are ppa's for newer versions, and i rcall intell having some  tool/script out for installing the latest ones.
[13:04] <adamk> pr0n: There's no way to disable the discrete GPU in the BIOS?
[13:04] <carpediembaby> adamk: so the display will remain at this 1024x768 resolution with horrible graphics performance?
[13:05] <carpediembaby> Dr_willis: okay, i'll try to search for it
[13:05] <carpediembaby> thanks
[13:05] <ObrienDave> intel uses the mesa drivers. at least mine does
[13:05] <adamk> carpediembaby: Is it 1024x768 before or after you booted with "nomodeset"
[13:06] <ObrienDave> adamk, if you did that, i dont think you would see anything at all
=== awoods_ is now known as aawoods
[13:07] <carpediembaby> adamk: well before, i could only see the cursor. but it seemed to be at a good (actual) resolution. but now, if i go to appearance it says i have 2560x1600 but its clearly not that. my screen is 1368xsomething
[13:07] <carpediembaby> and there is no option to change the screen size. and i see jitter when i try to minimize/maximize stuff
[13:07] <adamk> carpediembaby: OK, the first thing I'd do is remove the nomodeset option. Disabling KMS generally causes problems.
[13:07] <adamk> Much like the ones you are describing.
[13:08] <pr0n> adamk: nope :(
[13:09] <carpediembaby> adamk: then it might not boot in again ... but i'll give it a try
[13:10] <amx109> i have this irritating bug where apt ges stuck on '100% reading package lists'. when my laptop first boots i dont have that problem, but after a day or so of uptime, apt-get becomes impossible to use. ive tried solutions for similar probelms but no result. can anyone help?
[13:10] <adamk> carpediembaby: Try to force a specific resolution with KMS by using the video=XRESxYRES option (ie. video=1368x768)
[13:11] <pr0n> i have already once burnt my cooling sink of my laptop, got it replaced today. i dont want to burn it down by usage of ubuntu again :(
[13:12] <ObrienDave> amx109, you might look into clearing the apt cache and reloading your sources

[13:14] <ObrienDave> b3rz3rk3r, usually just the ones under /home/user_name
[13:14] <adamk> pr0n: You could try this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Hybrid_graphics#Fully_Power_Down_Discrete_GPU
[13:15] <amx109> ObrienDave: ive done that before and it didnt help. ive ran strace and iotop..apt just seems to run through the package lists very very slowly
[13:15] <b3rz3rk3r> ObrienDave, that's what I figured, but thought I'd check just to be safe. Thanks :)
[13:16] <ObrienDave> amx109, do these commands look familiar?

[13:21] <cfhowlett> parapan, to a degree but not perfectly.
[13:22] <minixvm> parapan: it tries to be as compatible as it can
[13:22] <ObrienDave> parapan, couldn't live without LibreOffice or OpenOffice. never had a format problem with either

[13:55] <wylde_child> maybe i still dont get the hang of linux but i just want the exact same setup after restoring, so i dont have to tweak everything again
[13:57] <ObrienDave> wylde_child, there are backup programs that would restore the system. duplicity comes to mind. afaik iw would only restore the full system
[13:57] <ObrienDave> *it
[13:58] <wylde_child> i'm also afraid that it would delete everything on my harddrive (where i want to store my backup)
[13:58] <wylde_child> because i do stupid things^^
[13:59] <ginkgo> wylde_child: because you can tweak everything in linux "exact same setup" is a bigger job than you might think
[13:59] <minixvm> wylde_child: you are making a backup on the medium you want to restore the backup to?

[14:00] <ObrienDave> no, it's a stand alone program
[14:00] <gordonjcp> wylde_child: what?
[14:01] <betrayd> I need to 'retrieve' the conf of my working grub on dualboot XP/Linux. Would boot-repair be able to recover it?
[14:01] <wylde_child> Once Duplicity is installed and an FTP account is ready to receive the backup files,

[14:35] <colin_> I want to have a brief discussion on integration of Linux based traditional PCs and Android mobile PCs.
[14:35] <colin_> How will I be able to access an Android phone's flash storage chip from my Linux box?
[14:36] <colin_> I am on this IRC because my Linux is among the varied *buntus.
[14:37] <minixvm> colin_: all i needed to do was connect it via usb
[14:37] <ActionParsnip> colin_: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue   on your desktop system?
[14:37] <colin_> Anyway back to accessing the phone's storage chip. Like in transferring photo files to my Linux.
[14:37] <colin_> ActionParsnip: what the heck is /etc/issue.
[14:38] <ActionParsnip> colin_: its a file
=== BadLarry_ is now known as BadLarry
[14:38] <colin_> ActionParsnip: Ubuntu 11.10
[14:38] <ActionParsnip> colin_: run the command I gave, what is the output please?
[14:38] <minixvm> colin_: 11.10 is no longer supported
[14:38] <colin_> ActionParsnip: pls let me back to my main topic.
[14:38] <ses1984> i'd like to be able to customize the profile a new user gets when i add a new user to the system, i guess i would do that by customized /etc/skel
[14:39] <ActionParsnip> colin_: its part of the fix
[14:39] <colin_> Do I access the phone's storage chip just like it's a USB flash?
[14:39] <ses1984> i was wondering how i would set it up so a new user would automatically have certain samba shares mounted
[14:39] <ses1984> but i'm not sure where that information belongs as part of a user profile
[14:39] <colin_> Another question: phone tethering.
[14:40] <colin_> I rather would do phone tethering via USB. So does tethering does anything else beside the possibly of the phone as a cell modem?
[14:41] <colin_> minivxm: sorry ubuntu 11.10 no longer supported.
[14:41] <ActionParsnip> colin_: hence me asking
[14:42] <ActionParsnip> colin_: so it IS part of the main topic, isn't it

[14:42] <mustmodify> `
[14:42] <ActionParsnip> colin_: when people ask you things, despite what you MAY think, they are part of the fix,.
[14:42] <colin_> ActionParsnip: interface between android phones and linux boxes is the main topic for me this moment.
[14:42] <mustmodify> Can't find it on google but surely someone has written that
[14:42] <Pici> mustmodify: pipe through nl
[14:43] <mustmodify> Pici: thanks I'll try athat.
[14:43] <mustmodify> that
[14:43] <ActionParsnip> colin_: your release is no longer supported
[14:43] <minixvm> colin_: and for us to help you with that you'd need to be running a supported version of ubuntu
[14:44] <ActionParsnip> colin_: that fact trumps any other fact
[14:44] <colin_> my phone is a recent model; less than 6 months old.
[14:44] <ActionParsnip> colin_: but your OS is dead
[14:44] <minixvm> colin_: if only your ubuntu install was recent too..
[14:44] <ActionParsnip> colin_: the OS you are using is EOL
[14:45] <colin_> ActionParsnip: well I'm sorry that my Ubuntu is EOL. I'll go. Bye.
[14:48] <ActionParsnip> I love when people don't think questions are relevant
[14:49] <mmrazik> petervonfrosta: hi. tvoss mentioned you are playing with raspberry pi..
[14:50] <petervonfrosta> hey, yes, that's right
[14:50] <Capprentice> Where I can get a easy guide on all the ways to compile a .deb binary for Ubuntu ?
[14:50] <petervonfrosta> but i am a newbe and trieing to get bluettoth working
[14:51] <sere_> Question: Im working on this labtop that was dropped and everything seem to be functional but for some reason this battery wont hold a charge..i was reading that in windows you can drain and then regenerate the battery power.. is that possible in ubuntu or some other tools to trouble shoot this?
[14:51] <mmrazik> petervonfrosta: with some bluetooth dongle?
[14:51] <mmrazik> never tried that :-/
[14:52] <sere_> the labtop will not in get power for the cord and the cord is good
[14:52] <dellos> aa
[14:52] <ActionParsnip> Capprentice: use checkinstall to make a deb from compiled source rather than: sudo make install
[14:53] <dellos> cant find home/username/.vim
[14:53] <ActionParsnip> sere_: I'd ask in ##hardware
[14:53] <iceroot> Capprentice: have a look at debhelper (man debhelper) and searching on the debian website about debhelper and packaging
[14:53] <ActionParsnip> sere_: a system not charging is OS independant
[14:53] <petervonfrosta> you want to know the bluetouth chip? or dongle? the dongle is from logilink, it should be compatible...
[14:53] <Capprentice> http://www.webupd8.org/2010/01/how-to-create-deb-package-ubuntu-debian.html
[14:53] <dellos> so where to install pluging
[14:53] <petervonfrosta> some tools from installed bluez package do work
[14:53] <Capprentice> Do I need not to follow any of those :http://www.webupd8.org/2010/01/how-to-create-deb-package-ubuntu-debian.html
[14:54] <sere_> ActionParsnip: i started out in my usb slax and then installed lubuntu .32 as we discussed yesterday :)
[14:55] <mmrazik> petervonfrosta: not sure I'll be able to help you. I'm actually fairly new to Pi as well. I just tried to recently play with it mostly to try some electronics stuff. Never tried any radio (bluetooth nor wifi)

[15:00] <sudobash> 1 sec and I'll get the command
[15:00] <sudobash>  1995  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5

[15:01] <sudobash> any advice? I've tried skipping deps but not luck
[15:04] <jrib> sudobash: my advice is not to use that ppa
[15:05] <sudobash> I guess there isn't a rebuilt sasl package for 5.4.15?
[15:05] <ginkgo> is there any advantage 13.04 > 12.04 ? because i don't see one
[15:06] <minixvm> ginkgo: more recent kernel and packages
[15:06] <ginkgo> minixvm: packages too?
[15:06] <minixvm> ginkgo: indeed, every release has newer packages
