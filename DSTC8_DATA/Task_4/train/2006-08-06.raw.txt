[00:16] <eternaljoy> sparkleytone: how do I symlink the java plugin?
[00:16] <Jack_Sparrow> starscream[2] : NOt using sata raid correct?
[00:17] <EvilGuru> sparkleytone: The motherboard has support for ATA-66 if that is what you mean?
[00:17] <starscream[2] > Jack_Sparrow> I got to install grub and it got an error so I installed LILO instead, but I think I installed it to the wrong partition, should I just try from scratch agaon?
[00:17] <eternaljoy> NickGarvey: what web browser does Dapper come with when I install Dapper from CD?
[00:17] <qwerty2k> eternaljoy, easier to use Automatix, it will auto install all firefox plugins for you
[00:17] <sparkleytone> eleazar123: dammit...i'm bad at syntax today.  you need to 'mount -o bind /proc /mnt/sdc/proc'  ... i'm sorry
[00:17] <Renan_s2> eternaljoy, Firefox
[00:17] <starscream[2] > Jack_Sparrow> no not raid however this is a 64bit machine
[00:17] <sparkleytone> EvilGuru: no i mean ATA6
[00:17] <eleazar123> sparkleytone, np :) i'm learning from this as well
[00:17] <Jack_Sparrow> starscream[2] : the plot thickens, how are the partitions setup.. If xp isnt #1 on drive 1 then it is a prob

[00:36] <starscream[2] > Jack_Sparrow, they said they recommend against it and dont give help if you do
[00:36] <sparkleytone> nicholaspaul: you probably want to create 2 partitions on the new drive, format them and cp all your /home/* and /usr/* into each respective one.  then you can just change your fstab to mount the partitions into /home and /usr

[01:17] <qwerty2k> Hit3k, alternatively use a program called Automatix (search ubuntu forums for it), it will auto install java amongst other things you can choose from)
[01:17] <minimec> Silenti-Ambulo: OK. What you can do no is to install another kernel, like the i386 kernel if you're working with the pentium optimized. Or you take an older version. By installing that, you will have the choice on the next boot <esc> to choose the kernel. Choose the new instakked one and try to configure your card.

[01:42] <Paladine> writing to ntfs from ext is very buggy to say the least
[01:42] <Paladine> no matter what you are using to do it

=== wweasel [n=karen@modemcable154.138-81-70.mc.videotron.ca]  has joined #ubuntu
[01:42] <stewski> well you dont write from ext3
[01:42] <wweasel> Hey all. Is it possible to add a link to a folder to the Places menu?
[01:43] <stewski> you write via your filesystem driver
[01:43] <stewski> but write support for ntfs is pretty new
[01:43] <slaxy> Paladine: is there no safe way to write ntfs from linux... if not ext2/ 3 maybe reiserfs
[01:43] <DarkAudit> so that external HD I'm thinking of getting would be best off formatted in FAT32 if it's going to be used by XP and Linux boxes?
=== richiefrich [n=dethwish@unaffiliated/richiefrich]  has joined #ubuntu
[01:43] <rdz> minimec, i cannot interpret the output of dmesg. can i pastebin you the lines that appear when i connect the drive?
[01:44] <wweasel> DarkAudit: Or ext2. Ext2 can be safely written from Windows.
[01:44] <Paladine> slaxy, it is totallyunsafe to write to NTFS unless the system is live irrespective of where you are trying to do it from, unless you are accessing it as a samba share
[01:44] <Paladine> the ntfs filesystem needs to be live
[01:44] <stewski> yeah get the ext driver for win pretty safe way round
[01:44] <slaxy> what do u mean by live ????
[01:44] <Paladine> itisbecause of the way ntfs works
[01:44] <stewski> or better still get vmware and run windows under linux
[01:45] <Paladine> it needs to be on a booted system (as in windows)
[01:45] <wweasel> DarkAudit: It can either be formatted FAT32 or ext2.
[01:45] <Paladine> accessed via samba

[01:45] <MoNkUnClE> Paladine is there a way to do that with them existing on the same drive?
[01:45] <wweasel> dave: Alacarte Menu Editor
[01:45] <nu__> wweasel: yea
[01:45] <dave> thanks
[01:45] <wweasel> nu__: How?
[01:45] <Paladine> MoNkUnClE, you can make vmware server use an existing windows installation for a guest operating system
[01:45] <nu__> wweasel: i asked that same question when i was using xubuntu. let me make sure if it works. ill try now
[01:46] <Paladine> other than that, no
[01:46] <DarkAudit> wweasel: ok... I was intrigued by that media router... attach a usb drive to it, and move all my music/videos to that, independent of my OS
[01:46] <SeaRunner> ok the CANON scsi Slide Scanner is working happily
[01:46] <slaxy> well i have 4 ntfs drives... and i have started using ntfs-3g ... but then do u think i can use samba on the same system accessing those 4 drives
[01:46] <MoNkUnClE> Paladine i think i have the vmware server installed do u know where i might find a good howto on it??

=== tanath [n=user@d36-72-255.home1.cgocable.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[01:48] <wweasel> DarkAudit: Well, here's the deal.  FAT32 would be more portable, cause every OS can read/write without drivers. You can take it anywhere, to any computer, no need to install anything.  The prob is that FAT32 has a maximum file size.  ext2 can be read/write in Windows, but it requires custom drivers. You can install them on any windows install. And it doesn't have a stupid max file size.

[01:51] <slaxy> Paladine: how does vmware help ?? for the already existing ntfs dirves
[01:51] <Paladine> mjr, acs stands for Access Control System iirc
[01:51] <wweasel> nu__: That's kinda vague. Do you mean when I right click on the top panel and select "Add to Panel..."?

[01:51] <stewski> Im not sure I understand paladine as I understand it ntfs write underlinux doesnt support all ACL attributes buth thats a long way from it will definately destroy your partition?
[01:51] <Paladine> slaxy, you can instruct vmware to create a guest OS from an existing windows installation
[01:51] <nu__> wweasel: yes. on that window, there are two tabs at the top. click on "Custom application launcher"
[01:51] <wweasel> Done

[01:52] <nu__> wweasel: for "type", select Application

[01:52] <wweasel> nu__: Alright
[01:52] <nu__> wweasel: and for "command", do this: nautilus /path/to/dir
[01:52] <Paladine> mjr, ok you use something to write to ntfs from linux then, but don't come here complaining when you hose the partition
[01:52] <nu__> wweasel: youw ill also have to give it a name :p
