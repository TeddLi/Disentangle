[07:23] <Hotdog003> armenb: (from "How Linux Works") PC hardware has a battery-backed "real time" clock. It's not the greatest clock in the world, but it's better than nothing. The kernel usually sets its time based on this clock at boot time, and you can reset the system clock to the current hardware time with the command 'hwclock'.

[09:15] <Cntryboy> kk
[09:15] <eri1> anyone have any ideas on ubuntu hanging up? i have a sony vaio pcg-k17 (IGP345 video card), dapper drake is installed and working fine.  if i let it sit for awhile and come back it's hung (whole pc, cursor doesn't blink, ctrl_alt_backspace doesn't exit gnome).  soemtimes it will hang as i'm working. any ideas on boot settings that might dumb down video accelleration?  I'm guessing maybe something going on there so wanted to rule that
[09:15] <dylan_> Why does Ubuntu advertise the operating system as being completely free and open source when it includes restricted drivers in the default installation?
[09:15] <Flawless> In 5.10, "sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales" worked. Now it doesn't ask what locale I want

[09:16] <_Spire_> Mandalf: didn't you set up a user during the install?
[09:16] <Mandalf> _Spire_: nope
[09:16] <eri1> surfnkid: haha... right you are.   how do i control the video accelleration settings?
