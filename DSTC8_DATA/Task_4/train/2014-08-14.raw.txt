[02:16] <daftykins> FLCl: can you take a picture with a camera of each of your EFI setup screens and share them online?
[02:16] <mitchelwb> daftykins: looks like http://paste.ubuntu.com/8041334
[02:16] <FLCl> when i enable uefi support
[02:16] <daftykins> mitchelwb: and can you confirm the graphics hardware from 'lspci' ?
[02:17] <FLCl> I'm sorry what exactly is the EFI setup screen?
[02:17] <Beldar> FLCl, So what are you going to load there to fool them, I think they are on your side basically. Booting a disc or usb is probably a user skill issue.
[02:17] <Beldar> unless it is broken
[02:18] <daftykins> FLCl: the setup screens you go into to configure boot mode etc etc
[02:18] <kz> sudo: error in /etc/sudo.conf, line 0 while loading plugin `sudoers_policy'
[02:18] <kz> sudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be only be writeable by owner

[02:18] <FLCl> Okay Dafty, thank you for the help I will upload now. Give me a few mins.
[02:18] <daftykins> FLCl: possibly your Lenovo has a special button you press when powered off to boot and enter the setup, otherwise it's likely a key like delete, F2, F8, F10, F12... the usual
[02:19] <enjoi> nvm, seems to work fine with firefox, no ,desktop shortcut needed
[02:19] <enjoi> woop woop
[02:19] <mitchelwb> daftykins: I think the line you're looking for is: 04:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] RV770 [Radeon HD 4850/4870]
[02:19] <enjoi> juniper vpn success on ubu 14.04 yayyyyyy
[02:19] <Beldar> the manual will say FLCl key
[02:19] <enjoi> this makes me so so so so happy lol
[02:20] <anonymous9037611> what version?
[02:20] <FLCl> dafty
[02:20] <FLCl> before I upload the pictures I think i should mention thast
[02:21] <FLCl> I just noticed that after removing all the os's on this computer, and going into bios and switching to UEFI support only I now have the option to boot into USB
[02:21] <FLCl> but only USB
[02:21] <FLCl> nothing else is listed
[02:21] <daftykins> mitchelwb: ah-har, you've got an old 4-series card that's only supported by the legacy radeon driver now i believe.
[02:21] <antiPoP> Hi,
[02:21] <Beldar> FLCl, Hit the tab key after typing dafty to get the nick correct.
[02:21] <hol> enjoi: what version of juniper vpn are you using?
=== rrrre445534 is now known as the_mighty_bogan
[02:22] <daftykins> FLCl: USB in EFI mode?
[02:22] <mitchelwb> daftykins: yeah, I think you're right... And I realized that AFTER I tried to install newer drivers today.  I tried to back it out, but apparently, I took a wrong turn at Albuquerque.
[02:22] <antiPoP> While updating ubuntu I got a few strange errors, I googled for tehse but I didn't got any info. Is this something I shoudl worry about? Here are the update logs: https://gist.github.com/antiPoP/d97e0d70407fb3255905
[02:22] <FLCl> daftykins:yes sir
[02:23] <FLCl> daftykins: i will be done uploading pictures soon
[02:23] <wahben> Hey Ubuntuers, question: I want a specific service that managed by rc.d to execute as a specific user instead of by root.
[02:23] <wahben> how to do?
[02:23] <daftykins> mitchelwb: whoops :D ok, i'd only be guessing which to install, i'd google for radeon legacy and 14.04 i think to see what you can do. from the log you can see it's failing then trying to use FBDEV, which isn't going to allow 3D and thus doesn't let Unity work
[02:24] <daftykins> wahben: disable it from rc.d then look if it can be executed as a user, then find the binary and run it
[02:24] <wahben> daftykins: .. obviously, but I want it to run as a service when system boots, just not with root
[02:25] <mitchelwb> daftykins: let me see if I can find it again.  I had it up earlier on my machine, but I'm on a different machine now so I'll have to try and relocate it.
[02:25] <wahben> can't you change user id in init.d script?
[02:26] <daftykins> wahben: perhaps a course of action could be suggested why you're trying to do something so ass-backwards :>
[02:26] <daftykins> +if you share
[02:27] <icecube45> HOLY KITTEN!
[02:27] <icecube45> daftykins: no idea what I did
[02:27] <icecube45> guess what's working?
[02:27] <daftykins> world peace!?
[02:27] <icecube45> NO!
[02:27] <icecube45> hehe
[02:27] <daftykins> ;) glad to hear it
[02:27] <icecube45> streaming
[02:28] <icecube45> i dont even know
[02:28] <wahben> meh.. nevermind, thanks for suggestion though.
[02:28] <wahben> peace
[02:28] <icecube45> Actually.. I might know what happened
[02:28] <icecube45> added my user to the video group
[02:28] <icecube45> haha
[02:28] <FLCl> daftykins: Hey sorry im taking so long its taking forever to upload. here is one of the pictures tho. This is with legacy support turned on. http://oi62.tinypic.com/2ez49rd.jpg
[02:29] <FLCl> daftykins: And here is with only uefi http://oi58.tinypic.com/2h4xoj5.jpg
[02:29] <daftykins> ah yes that's looking better, in the first
[02:29] <daftykins> oh, well in both :>
[02:29] <daftykins> FLCl: what's on the USB flash drive right now?
[02:30] <icecube45> hey daftykins, new question. best way to run scripts upon startup?
[02:30] <daftykins> icecube45: no idea :)
[02:30] <icecube45> good!
[02:30] <FLCl> currently the usb contains elementary os
[02:30] <_unreal_> hello. ok I can noit shut down this computer with out it feezing and having to force shutdown. 14.04 LTS desktop
[02:30] <FLCl> daftykins: THE USB CONTAINS ELEMENTARY OS
[02:30] <FLCl> daftykins:sorry for the caps
[02:30] <_unreal_> I know it froze on install on a network card driver error I believe
[02:30] <wafflejock> icecube45: have you typed start up in the lens
[02:30] <daftykins> FLCl: zomg caps, my ears! ok, so you want win7 and ubuntu eventually, yes? dualboot?
[02:31] <icecube45> whatnow wafflejock?
[02:31] <wafflejock> icecube45: oh you mean when a streaming server starts?
[02:31] <wafflejock> icecube45: just caught the end of that conversation
[02:31] <icecube45> no, system startup
[02:31] <FLCl> daftykins: yes sir ^.^ i would like both installed under efi if possible
[02:31] <_unreal_> any way it searchnig any logs? that would give a clue why the  computer is feezing every time I try to shut it down
[02:31] <wafflejock> icecube45: oh yeah so are you using a desktop environment, Unity, Gnome, KDE?
[02:31] <daftykins> FLCl: do you have another computer?
[02:31] <icecube45> wafflejock: 14.04 server
[02:32] <FLCl> daftykins: yes sir, I am on it currently
[02:32] <Panik> hey
[02:32] <icecube45> so. no to the desktop environment
[02:32] <daftykins> FLCl: ah good stuff, so you're going to want to make up that flash drive with win7 SP1 EFI bootable
[02:32] <icecube45> hey Panik, whadup
[02:32] <Panik> if I have to install ndiswrapper and the source pc doesnt have internet access... can i do it via windows then throw it on a usb and vala?
[02:32] <_unreal_> also TERMINAL is not giving me a command prompt. its totally blank
[02:32] <Panik> I mean, I assume i can, just wondering if there is any probelsm with doing it that way
[02:33] <daftykins> FLCl: make sure that on the other setup pages, 'secure boot' is disabled if it is present
[02:33] <FLCl> daftykins: Im sorry im rather noobish, how would i make it efi bootable?
[02:33] <wafflejock> icecube45: think you need .bashrc but ubottu has no ifno
[02:33] <wafflejock> info*
[02:33] <icecube45> mm
[02:33] <icecube45> Can't I just drop a script into init.d?
[02:33] <icecube45> or init
[02:34] <wafflejock> icecube45: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBootupHowto
[02:34] <_unreal_> ?
[02:34] <daftykins> Panik: you can pass the .deb's over, but you should be 100% sure there's no better way before resorting to ndiswrapper
[02:34] <FLCl> daftykins: secure boot is currently disabled sir, how should i turn the Windows 7 into efi bootable
[02:34] <daftykins> FLCl: see PM
[02:35] <daftykins> as we are drifting into Windows support territory right now, and here be dragons.
[02:35] <Panik> its what my manufactors is suggesting to do
[02:36] <daftykins> Panik: really? that's terrible, what wireless device is it?
[02:36] <mitchelwb> daftykins: I believe this is the correct driver  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver  But the part about purging fglrx seems to be a sticking point.
[02:37] <daftykins> mitchelwb: did you attempt to install any AMD driver from their website, or fglrx package when you were updating earlier?
[02:37] <wafflejock> icecube45: looks like that document is a bit dated but it links to an up to date guide for the upstart cookbook
[02:37] <mitchelwb> daftykins: the fglrx one, yes.
=== Guest-9800 is now known as zealotnagah
[02:38] <icecube45> yea, wafflejock I found rc.local
[02:38] <daftykins> mitchelwb: was that via package or download?
[02:38] <Psil0Cybin> hey guys if i am backing up my home folder and am copying all the files over, do i need to access it as root on the computer to copy it? or can i just copy and paste on to the ext4 thumbdrive.
[02:39] <daftykins> Psil0Cybin: user is fine, but ideally you'd do it from a live session so no files are locked/in use
[02:39] <mitchelwb> daftykins: package.  I don't have the url of the page that I got the instructions from now though.
[02:39] <Psil0Cybin> daftykins, i have an encrypted home directory so i cant do it via live cd..
[02:39] <Psil0Cybin> what is the next best method?
[02:39] <daftykins> you could if you then unlocked the home in the live session
[02:40] <daftykins> mitchelwb: "dpkg -l | grep fgl | pastebinit"
[02:40] <Psil0Cybin> daftykins, is there a guide on doing that? I am new, never done that before...so I dont want to make mistakes, nor i guess flood this channel; asking for basic help questions
[02:40] <Psil0Cybin> regarding that issue
[02:40] <Psil0Cybin> unless its a simple process?
[02:41] <mitchelwb> daftykins: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8041484
[02:41] <daftykins> Psil0Cybin: i'm too sane and un-worried about my cat pictures to use encryption
[02:41] <daftykins> mitchelwb: yeah, "sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx* " then - be sure you include that * at the end
[02:44] <Nordom> Hello, I installed a package for Xen. And it had a grub file that came with it. Somehow I bugged it and caused my system to crash so I removed the grub using grub customiser. I fixed the issue and now I need that grub back. I dont know what was on the grub I deleted and guides haven't been very helpful on how to set that up. Is there some way I can remove Xen and reinstall it to get it back?
[02:44] <Nordom> I tried udo apt-get remove xen-hypervisor-amd64 but it didnt seem to remove it
[02:44] <daftykins> sudo apt-get install --reinstall <package>
[02:44] <Nordom> Daftykins thanks I will try that
[02:46] <Psil0Cybin> daftykins, lol, so what would i do when i boot the live CD to mount the home directory...its located in the default partition sets, so it does not have a seperate directory or anything funky yet..until I learn how to do these things of course, but....
[02:46] <Psil0Cybin> you suggested i can just mount the home directory and copy it via the live cd?
[02:46] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: In the Live ISO environment, "sudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils" and then "ecryptfs-recover-private /home/$USER". See "man ecryptfs-recover-private" first!
[02:47] <Psil0Cybin> Thank you TJ-.
[02:48] <Psil0Cybin> hmmm it keeps saying Collecting Files when I just tried to copy and paste from the home directory onto the thumb drive, sigh..lol
[02:48] <mitchelwb> daftykins: I did purged the fglrx (that was a slightly different command from the instructions linked on the driver page) and then did a reinstall of mesa-utils and a reboot and I seem to be back in business!
[02:49] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: Abandon the GUI and embrace the terminal shell  :)
[02:49] <Psil0Cybin> TJ-, nvm it worked now, and i should....I think I need to start compiling my own documents on what i do so I remember all these steps you guys tell me...its all golden!
[02:50] <evoly> Hello! Why do i get the message "bash: cowsay: command not found" if i try to run cowsay as root? Cowsay as normal user works, but not as root... This is not a serious problem but i'm just curious about why this does not work.
[02:50] <Psil0Cybin> last question how can i double check that my permissions copied over properly, i guess..just on the home directory type ls -l and then do the same in the terminal of the dir of the backup?
[02:51] <Psil0Cybin> yea the GUI is telling me "Can't copy special file"
[02:51] <daftykins> mitchelwb: excellent :D
[02:51] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: unless the copy is destined for a file-system that doesn't store POSIX/*nix permissions (such as NTFS or FAT), then permissions should be the same
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> okay cool
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> yea i am using ext4. ty
[02:52] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: "Special files" are usually things like FIFO pipes
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> so i should be fine correct...it looked like a gnome thing anyway..
[02:53] <Psil0Cybin> I really only want to back up my information/themes/icons/ssh keys/gpg keys
[02:53] <Psil0Cybin> information is easy to back up...but the rest, is in the home directory correct?
[02:54] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: This is a reason for working directly from a Virtual Terminal (VT) when doing these kind of operations, because the GUI will be using several files within the home directory for live activity.

[02:55] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: If you only want to preserve data you created, in *general*, copying everything except 'dotfiles' (files and directories beginning with a "." that 'hides' them from directory listings by default) is sufficient. If you want settings and configurations from the applications you use, you must ensure you get the 'dotfiles' too
[02:56] <Psil0Cybin> TJ-, thank you that answers actually my next few questions...thank you.
[02:56] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: In a terminal you can see 'dotfiles' by using the "-A" switch to "ls". In GUI there's usually an option to enable listing of 'hidden' files which does the same thing
[02:56] <Psil0Cybin> yea CTRL+H enables it... i am getting the .dot files, but i am worried that some of the files in use would be like SSH keys? If that is not the case then i am fine regardless...
[02:57] <Psil0Cybin> i am not using anything just copying stuff over, so i was assuming the stuff thats locked is mostly stuff for the current system
[02:57] <daftykins> you're not copying them graphically? :S
[02:57] <Psil0Cybin> I am, i was told i could open up thunar, and just copy and paste into the thumb-drive? as one way of backing up?
[02:57] <Psil0Cybin> should i not be?
[02:58] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: No, files are generally only held open when being actively written to, or read into memory. The files that are likely to be cause issues are desktop-environment control files for inter-process communication - which you can ignore
[02:58] <daftykins> flash drives != backup
[02:58] <Psil0Cybin> daftykins, ill do what ever you recommend, if i should not do it via the GUI then fine, just what would be the command to copy my directory into the thumbdrive :( sorry...guys, i know i am being very stupid atm but when I google, i find 1000 of methods of doing things, and i come here because i know you guys recommend the best lmao
[02:58] <daftykins> TJ-'ll sort you out :) i have to sleep now, i'm punching out for the night ;)
[02:58] <Psil0Cybin> but off google it just says make a ext4, and copy and paste with the .files that are normally hidden
[02:59] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: Graphically will generally be a *lot* slower than a terminal shell, because the tools spend ages building internal lists of files ands trying to present a graphical representation too... whereas the shell just gets on with the job
[02:59] <daftykins> TJ-: ^5
[02:59] <Psil0Cybin> TJ-, Makes plenty of sense, what would be the best command to copy them over... a simple cp?
[02:59] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: Also, when things go wrong, the GUI often gets in the way of identifying *what* was the exact cause.
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> cp (dir of home) (dir of backup)?
[03:01] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: We have a tool for that! "rsync" ... it is designed for efficient synchronisation of two directories, usually one is on a remote server, but can be used just as well locally. So you could do, for example: "rsync -av /home/$USER /media/$USER/USB/home/$USER/" (assuming "/media/$USER/home/$USER/" exists!)
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> oh wow!
[03:03] <Psil0Cybin> well maybe at the moment if your saying i should be fine, I will just copy and paste and learn more about that for next time, all i really want is my SSH keys/GPG keys, stuff like that..should be easy to back up regardless..
[03:03] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: slight correction here, to avoid creating an additional directory in the destination: "rsync -av /home/$USER/ /media/$USER/USB/home/$USER/"
[03:03] <Psil0Cybin> wow thanks i need to look into rsync!
[03:03] <Psil0Cybin> never even knew this stuff exist
[03:04] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: the keys are in "/home/$USER/.ssh/" and "/home/$USER/.gnupg/" I think
[03:04] <Psil0Cybin> TJ-, silly question gpg keys are stored in the home directory as well, as the SSH ones correct? like I know for a fact .ssh should be what i need
[03:04] <Psil0Cybin> oh wow...ur amazing
[03:04] <Psil0Cybin> lol!
[03:04] <Psil0Cybin> i just died
[03:04] <TJ-> Psil0Cybin: I think we have a telapathic connection :)
[03:05] <PCworker> Hello, I am looking for a program or a set of commands to be able to copy a partition and all its files to another hard drive. Or clone one disk to other disks. Anyone have any ideas on this subject?

[03:05] <daftykins> clonezilla - PCworker
[03:06] <Beldar> PCworker, +1 clonezilla
[03:06] <TJ-> PCworker: to clone a disk - assuming the target is the same size or larger than the source: "sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=1M"
[03:07] <PCworker> Can I get that from Software center or apt-get?? (clonezilla)
[03:07] <daftykins> PCworker: downloadable bootable ISO too

[03:10] <s1ckness> Anyone use ubuntu 14.04 here guys ?
[03:11] <TJ-> evil_dan2wik: You ran it without piping it a patch didn't you? :) press Ctrl+C and then show us the command you're trying to use and we'll correct it
[03:11] <evil_dan2wik> initrd@initrd-Aspire-xxxx:~/usbasp.2011-05-28/firmware$ sudo patch /home/initrd/Downloads/usbasp-pdi-usbaspfirmware-20120816.diff

[03:12] <evil_dan2wik> TJ-, ^
[03:14] <TJ-> evil_dan2wik: firstly, you shouldn't need sudo. Secondly the .diff file probably contains directory levels you'll need to tell 'patch' about with its "-p X" argument, and thirdly we use it from the base directory of the files we are patching like: "patch -p1 < /home/initrd/Downloads/usbasp-pdi-usbaspfirmware-20120816.diff"

[03:17] <icecube45> weird
[03:19] <Psil0Cybin> Quick question guys after coping my home directory into a thumbdrive (ext4) i checked my permissions and on the home directory on my computer the same folder that is drwx-----  is now drwxrwxr-x is that normal?
[03:19] <Psil0Cybin> or is that fine or are all my permissions messed up?
[03:21] <somsip> Psil0Cybin: how did you copy? Did you use whatever flag it is to preserver permissions?
[03:21] <Psil0Cybin> somsip, no i used thunar in root..and copied and pasted it into an ext4, and everyone said i should be fine
[03:21] <Tedel> hello, has anybody tried to create a calendar as a "template" for korganizer/kontact? see, I have about 20 tasks which repeat over and over again on all the projects I need to manage, so I created an ical of all those tasks and saved it on one file, with the intention of importing it (merging) with the main calendar every time I get a new project. has anybody tried this successfully? I just tried, but it failed.
[03:21] <Psil0Cybin> somsip, would that not work?
[03:22] <somsip> Psil0Cybin: depends how the ext4 is mounted, but maybe "everyone" will have an answer for you
[03:22] <eeee_> Psil0Cybin: cp -p
[03:23] <eeee_> cp changes permissions, mv doesn't (unless across volumes)
[03:23] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: they're slightly messed up, but the new permissions are more generous than the old ones, so most of the time it won't matter. A few programs e.g. ssh are fussy about directory permissions and may complain. You can fix them as you encounter them. Or do the copy all over again with better software...
[03:24] <Psil0Cybin> Loshki, well i really only want them for SSH and stuff like that, so how would I recopy it using cp - p (home folder) (folder of backup?)
[03:24] <Loshki> I prefer "rsync -av", not least because it has a "dry run" option....
[03:24] <somsip> Psil0Cybin: in this case, better software might be rsync
=== Sleepnbum is now known as Guest30968
[03:25] <Psil0Cybin> somsip, so i would (rsync -av /home/$USER/ /media/$USER/USB/home/$USER/)
[03:27] <Psil0Cybin> what would be the best method to use rsync in order to make sure i copied it over properly so i may not deal with problems down the road
[03:27] <somsip> Psil0Cybin: I use rsync -rtlDvu but you'd have to check what they all mean 'cos I don't remember. But your command looks okay in itself
[03:27] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: rsync -n -av --partial --progress  /home/$USER /media/$USER/USB/home  <--- note shorter path for destination, and use of -n
[03:28] <Psil0Cybin> Loshki, what does the n do? sorry, i guess ill have to go through the man page
[03:28] <Psil0Cybin> I just want tostart coping it over while i do that
[03:29] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: -n is a dry run. When you're happy the args are correct, remove it to do the actual copy...
[03:29] <vigoo> im having 64bit ubuntu 14.04 with a ralink rt5360. it detects wifi but does not connect. keeps asking for password and never connects. any idea what to do folks?
[03:30] <Tedel> does anybody know how to duplicate tasks on kontact?
[03:30] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: if you're very lucky, rsync will notice that only the permissions have changed, and it will fix them without a bunch of copying.
[03:31] <eeee_> Psil0Cybin: and if you're very unlucky it will think the size and mod time are the same and not do squat
[03:31] <eeee_> :D
[03:32] <Psil0Cybin> Loshki, okay wait so i just run the command you said  rsync -n -av --partial --progress  /home/$USER /media/$USER/USB/home
[03:32] <Psil0Cybin> and if it works good remove the -n
[03:32] <Psil0Cybin> and i should be good to go? and my permissions should be good?
[03:32] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: exactly, and then you should be good to go, and the permissions should be correct. You will need to spot check a few of them to be sure, of course.

[03:34] <Psil0Cybin> Loshki, what does the dry run do, test that it can actually copy the files over? its showing me all the files..
=== chocolate_cake is now known as mgodzilla
[03:34] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: You could log the output as it runs, in case you have questions later.
[03:34] <Psil0Cybin> going down the list, so once it completes and it has no major error messages i would just remove the -n?
[03:35] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: dry run does everything except the actual copy. If it looks ok, then yes, just remove the -n
[03:36] <Psil0Cybin> Loshki, thank you guys, i really appreciate this..
[03:36] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: it worked?
[03:36] <Psil0Cybin> Well its working at the moment via the dry run, its showing all my files
[03:37] <Psil0Cybin> okay trhe dry run finished
[03:37] <Psil0Cybin> it said
[03:37] <Psil0Cybin> rsync error: some files/attrs were not transffered (see previous errors) (code 23) at main.c(1183)
[03:38] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: you might wanna redo the dry run, log the output, then check the particulars of those errors...
[03:39] <Psil0Cybin> how can i write the output to a file, because it seems to cut off the top part of what it copied over..
[03:40] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: rsync -n -av --partial --progress  /home/$USER /media/$USER/USB/home | tee logfile.txt
[03:40] <Psil0Cybin> thank you Loshki you are a big help. btw.

[03:43] <Psil0Cybin> Yea you rright, but thank you i will try the dry run again and log the files, its prob the GUI files that are in use
[03:43] <Psil0Cybin> right?
[03:44] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: whenever I've had copy errors like that it's usually been something unimportant, but it never hurts to check. The only thing worse than a corrupted backup is no backup at all...
[03:44] <Psil0Cybin> Loshki, you are correct, thank you for giving me this advice, it really would save me the stress / be worth it to be double checking prior to nuking my drives.

[03:58] <Loshki> Psil0Cybin: See what the dry run says. If you have sufficient permissions to read the files from the source directory and write them to the destination you can get away without root. If not, then run it as root. If you own the files you are backing up, running as root may be overkill but it pretty much forestalls any permissions problems. Of course, root can write anywhere, so you need to be a little more careful before you hit return...

[04:05] <Loshki> Hmm. Quite a compact written language. That takes about 3 lines in a romance language..

[04:29] <alfonsojon> Hello
[04:29] <alfonsojon> I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Power Mac G4, but it boots to a black screen with a cursor.
[04:30] <Beldar> !nomodeset | alfonsojon
[04:30] <ubottu> alfonsojon: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[04:30] <alfonsojon> It seems lightdm is not loading correctly, any suggestions?
[04:30] <jaymaker> Hello everyone!
[04:30] <alfonsojon> Beldar: I will take a look, thanks
[04:31] <ttal> any idea why mounting my raid drive to /mnt/ doesnt show up in the file browser under devices?
[04:32] <alfonsojon> Beldar: how can I boot using that from yaboot?
[04:32] <alfonsojon> My Mac is a PowerPC, so it doesn't use Grub
[04:32] <ttal> but when I mount to /media/ it shows up.
[04:33] <Beldar> alfonsojon, The link is for a grub mod, so probably not. Grub should be involved somewhere, not sure the answer.
[04:33] <Takkun> Can someone help me install ubuntu?
[04:33] <alfonsojon> Darn.
[04:34] <Takkun> guys?
[04:35] <alfonsojon> Beldar: I got it, a quick Google search sent me on the right path

[04:36] <Beldar> Takkun, Tell the channel the issue, f I recognize it I will try.
[04:36] <Beldar> if*
[04:37] <wafflejock> Takkun: where are you trying to install and what version?
[04:38] <Takkun> Basically I have two hard drives in my computer, an SSD and a normal 1tb hard drive. I had Ubuntu installed on the SSD in legacy mode, but my entire boot got messed up so I reformated both hard drives. I currently have no os installed. I am trying to install Ubuntu onto the SSD however, it does not get detected only my normal hd does
[04:38] <Takkun> Any way to fix this?
[04:39] <Takkun> I have used Gparted to see all paritions, but it only shows my 1tbh hard drive
[04:39] <wafflejock> Takkun: you're using the 14.04 desktop install?
[04:39] <Beldar> Takkun, pastebin sudo parted -l
[04:40] <Takkun> Correct I am using the 14.04 install and i will pastebin tht in a moment plz hold
[04:40] <_2_landa> hey
[04:41] <wafflejock> Takkun: are both drives internal as well? it might be worth disconnecting the secondary and just leaving the SSD hooked up to see if it's any different

[04:55] <TJ-> Takkun: check in the system firmware in case it has been disabled
[04:55] <stiv2k_> cfhowlett: i want to lower my power consumption ...... or at least get more computing power per kW
[04:55] <Takkun> TJ-: Sorry sir, how do i do that?
[04:55] <Beldar> Takkun This is there, /dev/sr0 read-write (Read-only file system).  /dev/sr0 and note TJ-'s comment
[04:55] <stiv2k_> i keep it under 100% load
[04:55] <stiv2k_> this one has been running for about 2 years now
[04:56] <kryptonradon> I'm looking for 32 bit compatability libs for 14.04, I can't find libfreetype
[04:56] <Takkun> Beldar: Yeah i noticed that too. I'm not really sure how to do what tj has recommend.
[04:57] <TJ-> Takkun: Beldar 'sr0' is the SCSI name for a read-only CD-ROM device
[04:57] <cfhowlett> !info libfreetype
[04:57] <ubottu> Package libfreetype does not exist in trusty
[04:57] <TJ-> Takkun: investigate the system's firmware Setup options when the PC is switched on

[04:58] <TJ-> stiv2k_: Not unless you have cygwin installed
[04:58] <Beldar> TJ-, I thought it might be but the unrecognized disk label I did not recognize, thanks.
[04:58] <Takkun> TJ-: that makes alot of sense :/, are the systems firmware settings the same thing as the bios settings?
[04:58] <TJ-> Takkun: Yes :)
[04:58] <kryptonradon> !info libfreetype6
[04:58] <ubottu> libfreetype6 (source: freetype): FreeType 2 font engine, shared library files. In component main, is optional. Version 2.5.2-1ubuntu2.2 (trusty), package size 293 kB, installed size 878 kB
[04:59] <Takkun> TJ-: thank you sir :) i don't believe thats the problem :C seeing as how the bios also does not list the ssd, and there is no option to disable :C
[04:59] <TJ-> Takkun: It is unusual that the system firmware can disable a device such that Linux cannot see it; You could have a device that has got a fault
[04:59] <kryptonradon> I need the 32 bit lib for 64 bit system?
[04:59] <Takkun> TJ-: Do you thin the ssd might have broken?
[04:59] <lotuspsychje> Takkun: wich brand is your ssd?
[05:00] <cfhowlett> kryptonradon, 32 bit will run if no 64 bit version is available
[05:00] <Takkun> lotuspsychje: I am not sure sir :C it came preinstalled on this laptop
[05:00] <lotuspsychje> Takkun: wich laptop plz?
[05:00] <TJ-> Takkun: If even the firmware doesn't report finding it, either it has become disconnected or it has broken. I'd be investigating if it is possible to open the flap that covers where the SSD is installed, remove it, then reseat it carefully to ensure a firm physical connection
[05:00] <kryptonradon> 32 bit program needs libfreetype6
[05:01] <Takkun> TJ-: i have searched through the bios options, the ssd is not listed and there is no option to disable any devices
[05:01] <TJ-> kryptonradon: If the system has the foreign architecture i386 configured it is possible to install 32-bit libraries with "apt-get install <package>:i386"
[05:02] <kryptonradon> the problem i have is i don't know the name of the package
[05:02] <TJ-> Takkun: Try the second option then - physical refit
[05:02] <lotuspsychje> Takkun: you bought a laptop with ssd inside that doesnt work?
[05:02] <lotuspsychje> Takkun: wich laptop brand, and wich Os was preinstalled on it?
[05:03] <Takkun> lotuspsychje: The ssd used to work, its jus tht i installed ubuntu on it, and then erased it and now its no longer detected :/ Its a lenovo y510p and windows 8 was preinstalled
[05:03] <lotuspsychje> Takkun: did you check uefi settings?
[05:03] <TJ-> Takkun: You said earlier you "reformatted both drives" - how, exactly, did you do that?
[05:04] <TJ-> Takkun: Is Secure Boot or Rapid Boot enabled in firmware? try disabling them
[05:04] <Takkun> TJ-: secure boot is indeed disabled, and i reformated by inserting a WIndows 7 install disc and deleting the partitions and reformated them from there
[05:10] <lotuspsychje> Takkun: did your ubuntu setup recognize your ssd?
[05:10] <TJ-> Takkun: "reformatting" ... you mean you deleted the partition entries in the partition table and re-added them?
[05:10] <TJ-> Takkun: Have you powered the laptop down completely since doing that?
[05:10] <Takkun> TJ-: Correct sir I have powered it down completely, and correct that is how i reformated them
[05:10] <TJ-> lotuspsychje: Apparently so - Ubuntu was installed on the SSD
[05:10] <TJ-> Takkun: I go back to doing a physical re-fit of the SSD
[05:10] <Takkun> lotuspsychje:yes it recognized it, it actually wouldnt let me isntall it anywhere besides the ssd
[05:10] <Takkun> TJ-: i am not able to physically re-fit it as it would void the warranty
[05:10] <MrSalt> What's a good open source news source on the web?  It seems like there's a bunch of stuff going on that I keep missing.

[05:12] <lotuspsychje> TJ-: nice find!
[05:13] <TJ-> Takkun: It doesn't help that you currently have no Windows OS to use to extract that bootable image from. It might be possible to hack it from Linux
[05:13] <Takkun> TJ-: thanks friend. I guess i will go install windows now :C
[05:14] <TJ-> Takkun: don't do that yet!
[05:14] <lotuspsychje> Takkun: what happened exactly after you installed ubuntu on your ssd?
[05:14] <TJ-> Takkun: You first need to confirm the SSD in your laptop is made by Toshiba
[05:14] <TJ-> Takkun: Then we can look at extracting the bootable USB image from that Windows executable file
[05:16] <TJ-> Takkun: OK, it should be easy to create the bootable image from Linux - it's a just a bootable DOS image
[05:16] <Takkun> TJ-: how would i confirm this? I am looking at the lenovo website and it doesnt list wht brand it is
[05:16] <Takkun> TJ-: do you mean i should use like virtual box to install windows?
[05:16] <TJ-> Takkun: look inside the laptop at the label on the SSD, if it is accessible
[05:16] <cfhowlett> Takkun, virtualbox still requires a working OS
[05:17] <TJ-> Takkun: No, you don't need Windows. Please be patient, I am creating a bootable USB image for you from the Win7.zip file.
[05:17] <Takkun> TJ-: im rly sorry for being troublesome, :( also i cannot open the laptop
[05:18] <TJ-> Takkun: OK, then you'll need to wait for me to get this ready for you, so you can boot the laptop with a USB drive connected, and test it that way

[05:19] <Takkun> TJ-: okay thank you friend
[05:21] <alfonsojon> I am running Ubuntu 14.04 on my Power Mac G4 with an ATI Radeon 9000 Pro. When I boot using "radeon.modeset=1 video=radeonfb:off radeon.agpmode=4", I can make it to the login screen but it hangs after a few seconds.

[05:24] <Beldar> alfonsojon, Has that computer ever run ubuntu, seems a bit low in needed hardware?
[05:24] <alfonsojon> Yes, 12.04 ran fine
=== badon_ is now known as badon
[05:24] <alfonsojon> Also, Lubuntu 13.10 ran on it too
[05:25] <Beldar> alfonsojon, It seems lubuntu would be much better
[05:25] <alfonsojon> But I am stuck at LightDM
[05:25] <alfonsojon> Does Lubuntu not also use LightDM?
[05:26] <alfonsojon> I found that radeon.nomodeset=1 should not be used
[05:27] <alfonsojon> And now it does not hang, but I still cannot log in.
[05:27] <alfonsojon> gnome-session-flashback just loops back to lightdm

[05:58] <TJ-> Takkun: OK, tested, working, and ready! You need a USB flash drive available that can be overwritten, and be at the terminal shell prompt
[05:59] <Takkun> I have a flash drive ready ^^
[05:59] <TJ-> Takkun: 1) download the file: "wget http://iam.tj/projects/misc/ssd_fw_up.img"
[06:01] <Takkun> TJ-: i have downloaded it
[06:01] <Takkun> brasero does not seem to detect it tho
[06:02] <TJ-> Takkun: next, identify which device name the USB flash drive has... usually you can tell by doing "ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/usb-*"
[06:02] <TJ-> Takkun: You don't need brasero
[06:02] <Takkun> the flash drive it called sandisk ^^
[06:02] <TJ-> Takkun: On my system that command shows me "/dev/disk/by-id/usb-SanDisk_Cruzer_Micro_20060775000A7FF0D518-0:0 -> ../../sdc"
[06:02] <TJ-> Takkun: So I now know the device is "/dev/sdc"

[06:11] <coolstar> (yes it's a chromebook)
[06:11] <TJ-> Takkun: OK :) So reboot the system with the USB plugged in, the system should suggest a key you can press to get to the boot menu (often the key is F11 or F12), then select the USB device and boot.
[06:12] <somsip> coolstar: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2190187 (first link on a search, and there are others)

=== dojodgh is now known as dojodgh_
[06:13] <Takkun> TJ-: Ur one of those mad geniuses arent you x3 soo cool ^^ give me one sec plz i will do that now x3
[06:14] <Takkun> TJ-: i have ran the usb and it says this pc does not need an updated firmware
[06:18] <TJ-> Takkun: That's not helpful, but it does suggest that the tool recognised that there is a Toshiba SSD installed, yes?
[06:18] <Takkun> i think it would be safe to assume tht indeed
[06:19] <Takkun> or perhaps it has no relation
[06:19] <Takkun> :D
[06:19] <Takkun> :C
[06:19] <TJ-> Takkun: I ran it here and it told me there was no supported SSD in the system
[06:19] <Takkun> oh
[06:20] <TJ-> Takkun: so it sounds as if it found such a device in your system, checked the firmware version, and found it is already the correct version
[06:20] <Takkun> okay then yes i think its safe to assume that toshiba would be the brand
[06:20] <TJ-> Takkun: This doesn't help you of course... let me hack the files on that image in case it is possible to force it to reinstall the firmware

[06:33] <Takkun> TJ-: yes sir it is disabled ^^
[06:34] <TJ-> alfonsojon: There's a known issue with Toshiba SSDs where the firmware gets corrupted and the device isn't seen by the system (firmware or OS). We've checked using the Lenovo/Toshiba SSD firmware updater and the device doesn't need the firmware update

[06:40] <linuxuz3r> anyone knows how to take a screenshot in ubuntu window fullscreen and selection
[06:41] <TJ-> Takkun: I'd download the bootable ISO image, use 'dd' to write to your USB flash drive, and then reboot using it and test again... worth trying, if it avoids having to return the PC and get a replacement
[06:41] <Takkun> TJ-: but thts for thinkpads
[06:42] <Takkun> TJ-: i have an ideapad, does tht make a difference?
[06:42] <trijntje> linuxuz3r: just use the screenshot app that is installed by default
[06:42] <TJ-> Takkun: Well that came up as I was looking at the downloads for the Y510P
[06:42] <linuxuz3r> ok
[06:43] <linuxuz3r> how about a tool to write with a tablet on the desktop
[06:43] <TJ-> Takkun: the program checks the SSD versions... it won't do anything invasive without asking permission, so there is no harm trying it
[06:43] <Takkun> TJ-:since its an iso is it okay if i use brasero or do i have to use dd
[06:44] <TJ-> Takkun: 'dd' is quicker - you're writing to a USB
[06:44] <TJ-> Takkun: "sudo dd if=file.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M; sync" and you're done
[06:45] <trijntje> TJ, Takkun, dont run that command unless you are sure /dev/sdb is your usb drive
[06:45] <TJ-> trijntje: We know it is already
[06:46] <TJ-> Takkun: reading the notes for the ISO, it isn't certain it'll boot from USB... the install notes only talk about writing to a physical optical disk
[06:46] <dotDeb> dd is amazing
[06:46] <dotDeb> way better than any frontend
[06:47] <Takkun> TJ-: i will try the usb jus in case
[06:48] <TJ-> Takkun: Are you 100% sure that Y510P *has* an SSD!? I ask since I'm reading the Leonvo engineers service manual and it shows no SSD nor anywhere for one to fit!
[06:49] <Takkun> TJ-: that might be because i got my y510p when it was on sale, and they were giving the ssd for free
[06:49] <Takkun> TJ-: i know for a fact an ssd is there
[06:49] <TJ-> Takkun: I can't see a space inside for it, that's the weird part
[06:49] <Takkun> TJ-:the site even list an option to pay to install an additional ssd
[06:50] <Takkun> TJ-: i believe its installed in the ultra bay drive
[06:50] <TJ-> Takkun: The only thing mentioned is a 1TB hybrid drive (combined spinning disk with flash cache), 5,400rpm
[06:50] <TJ-> Takkun: Ahh, found it! 256GB SSD

[06:53] <abhishek__> I want to install ubuntu in blade that will go for production.Please give me tips for partition.I am planning to give /boot swap and / partitions only
[06:53] <Takkun> TJ-: the usb didnt work going to try on a dvd now
[06:53] <TJ-> Takkun: No, wait!
[06:54] <Blue1> might want to create a seperate /home partition - makes upgrading software a lot easier
[06:54] <TJ-> Takkun: I've just read in the Lenovo support that, and this is very weird, the SSD may not be seen in EFI mode! I don't know how accurate that is, but if the system is booting in EFI mode (as the Ubuntu Live ISO may be doing) that could explain this!
[06:55] <abhishek__> Blue1 thanks should I consider lvm over xfs ?
[06:55] <Blue1> abhishek__: I use lvm  -
[06:55] <Takkun> TJ-: i dont believe its booting in efi
[06:56] <Takkun> TJ-: there was a seperate option to boot into efi mode
[06:56] <Takkun> TJ-: also i have installed the os now, and am sure its not in efi
[06:56] <TJ-> Takkun: So, I'd suggest rebooting with the Live ISO and making sure the UEFI firmware has Compatibility Support Module (CSM) enabled and at the manual boot device menu, if there are 2 choices for the Installer device, try to determine which is the CSM BIOS and which the EFI, and choose the BIOS
=== sudhir_ is now known as nrange
[06:56] <TJ-> Takkun: OK... that shoots that idea down then! You can check if it is in EFI mode with "ls -l /sys/firmware/efi/" ... that will exist if in EFI mode
[06:57] <abhishek__> Blue1 default / partitions will create /home directory . this will not changed at least for five years
[06:59] <Takkun> TJ-: it says no such file or directory
[06:59] <Takkun> also i believe the SSD can be see in efi mode because when i had wins 8 on this machine it was able to see it
[07:00] <TJ-> Takkun: So, it is in BIOS mode then. OK, so its back to the "return to manufacturer" option I think
[07:00] <TJ-> Takkun: I'd have expected it could, but it was worth investigating

[07:09] <volkan> Hi
[07:09] <volkan> When I try to install H.264 decoder, I get this error: http://pastie.org/9472399 How can I solve this problem?
[07:10] <Syria> boichev: http://pastebin.com/xp2jHY2g  / I did not remove anything, It is a free account.
[07:10] <Takkun> TJ-: tht is indeed not the ultra bay
[07:11] <TJ-> Takkun: right, so there are 2 locations where it can be fitted :)
[07:11] <Takkun> TJ-: correct ^.^
[07:11] <TJ-> Takkun: I think the article I pointed you to is only for mini PCIe flash cache modules though. If your system has a 256GB SSD it'll be a 2.5" form-factor, and therefore have to be in the Ultra Bay because it is too big to go internally
[07:12] <Takkun> TJ-: i'm afraid to break it more >.>
[07:13] <ObrienDave> Syria, i sent you the new password changed today
[07:13] <TJ-> Takkun: Ultra-Bay release is easy... watch this video (shows removing the ultra-bay GPU option) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9LmpAoby4w

[07:14] <boichev> Syria, .... no passwords on irc directly please :) keep it on private...
[07:14] <Syria> ObrienDave:  I will try establishing a connection using the tutorial you gave me.
[07:14] <TJ-> Takkun: If you do remove the ultra-bay you can get the exact make and model of the SSD, so we have more accurate info to investigate
[07:15] <ObrienDave> Syria, that tutorial is the one i used

[09:10] <ikonia> Psil0Cybin: paranoid about what ???
[09:10] <anew> somsip sorry i was figuring all this out while i was typing
[09:10] <anew> so when i get the warning... even tho i get the warning, i do crontab -l and see the crontab for will
[09:10] <anew> ?
[09:11] <[^DarkGod^]> Psil0Cybin: now its working because you "disabled" the ssh auth using SSL
[09:11] <PechosRey> Hi
[09:11] <[^DarkGod^]> if you reboot your server, it will fail again
[09:11] <somsip> anew: did you work through the suggestions on the page I linked for you?
[09:11] <[^DarkGod^]> you have to check your ssh config and place the certs on the correct folders
[09:11] <anew> doing it now
[09:12] <[^DarkGod^]> the password prompt problem you have is because the server is asking for the ssl passphrase you used when you created the certs on 12.04
[09:12] <idimmu> Psil0Cybin: if you really want to know, install apt-rdepends and run  apt-rdepends -r gnome-keyring
=== thkang0 is now known as skyrunner14
[09:12] <ObrienDave> what? Psil0Cybin complain? naw, say it isn't so ;P
[09:13] <Psil0Cybin> oh you guys
[09:13] <idimmu> also what are you paranoid of?
[09:13] <Psil0Cybin> i want to re-enter my password in the terminal each time, I do not want someone to just type my last command in the terminal if i left my computer on and access my raspberry pi, and view my cat videos
[09:13] <PechosRey> How can i deactivate the samba service in Ubuntu 14.04 which is active by default
[09:13] <idimmu> use a screensaver that requires a password to unlock ..
[09:14] <PechosRey> i can't find it in the runlevels
[09:14] <Tachyon`> 'cat', heh, never heard it called that before
[09:14] <Psil0Cybin> ObrienDave, be a lover, not a hater..
[09:15] <Tachyon`> also, isn't that the active ingredient in magic mushrooms?
[09:15] <ikonia> Psil0Cybin: I don't understand tha actual problem ?
[09:16] <Psil0Cybin> nvm i figured it out i just wanted to disable gnome-keyring daemon
[09:17] <ikonia> so that's all you had to ask
[09:17] <Psil0Cybin> if i chmod it to 0, it stops bugging me.
[09:17] <ikonia> bad solution but "ok"
[09:17] <Psil0Cybin> what do you recommend.
[09:17] <ikonia> disabling the service
[09:17] <anew> somsip i dont understand what to do with the first answer...
[09:17] <anew> what do i type into the terminal?
[09:18] <Psil0Cybin> in what way ikonia? just kill it every start or boot? or can I physically set it to off?
[09:18] <ikonia> it's called from dbus I think from memory
[09:18] <ikonia> so disable it within dbus
[09:18] <ikonia> or just click "cancel" when it asks you for your password, it shouldnt ask you again for that session
[09:18] <ObrienDave> Psil0Cybin, i don't hate you, i think you worry too much and waste peoples time on really silly stuff
[09:19] <ikonia> if you're certain you don't want it ever, just remove the package
[09:19] <somsip> anew: the input after "nick@home-sv-1:~$ " gives the ouput shown underneath it. Do the ones in Problem and Solution. And read the rest
[09:20] <Psil0Cybin> ikonia, okay, but when I cancel obviously it just says pubkey denied because I did not enter a password. I am worried if I remove the package it might remove other packages I need for a standard Xubuntu install, How can I disable it through dbus perhaps in case it may cause problems later I can enable it..
[09:20] <PechosRey> nobody knows from where the samba service is autostarted in 14.04? the rc.local is empty
[09:20] <ikonia> Psil0Cybin I'd just remove it if you're that against it
[09:20] <Psil0Cybin> okay.
[09:21] <Psil0Cybin> ikonia, it wants to remove software center.
[09:21] <ikonia> https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring/Ssh
[09:21] <Psil0Cybin> I think disabling it is a better method should I just google it ( how to disable via dbus? )
[09:21] <Psil0Cybin> can I disable via dconf-editor?
[09:22] <ikonia> Psil0Cybin: I'd be surprised if software center depended on gnome-ask-pass/keyring
[09:22] <ikonia> ls -la
[09:22] <Psil0Cybin> ikonia, it wanted to remove gnome-keyring, oneconf, python-ubuntu-sso-client software-center ubuntu-sso-client
[09:22] <ikonia> oops
[09:22] <ikonia> surprising
[09:22] <ikonia> Psil0Cybin: what package did you tell it to remove ?
[09:23] <Psil0Cybin> gnome-keyring
[09:23] <ikonia> surprising
[09:23] <Tachyon`> hi, I've atm got grub2 installed with its loader in the mbr, however, for reasons I need not go into, that's no longer useful, I want to install it to the superblock of the root partition, is that as simple as doing a grub-install /dev/sda6 or is there more to it than that?
[09:24] <ikonia> http://askubuntu.com/questions/243397/xubuntu-disable-gnome-keyring worth a glance too
[09:25] <ikonia> le of using a wrapper script http://askubuntu.com/questions/412793/xubuntu-stop-gnome-keyring-daemon-from-impersonating-ssh-agent
[09:25] <ikonia> this should in my mind by changed at the dbus "call" line
[09:25] <menace> hi, i am just installing the netboot 14.10 image, and i had several lvs/vgs on the disk before. It seems i cannot stop the nulling of the disk. is that right? any experience with that?
[09:25] <somsip> !14.10 | menace
[09:25] <ubottu> menace: Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) is the next development release of Ubuntu due for release in October 2014. Support in #ubuntu+1. For more info, see the announcement at http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1363
[09:25] <blubaustin> hello
[09:26] <blubaustin> Was just wondering one thing can I have a NFS server and client running on the same machine? I am trying to share folders from both machines to each other
[09:26] <ikonia> blubaustin: yes you can
[09:27] <blubaustin> Alright was just wondering since I know with some things a client and server you can only have one or the other not both
[09:27] <ikonia> nfs is fine
[09:27] <blubaustin> I've never set up a NFS so I was just wondering
[09:27] <blubaustin> So this will be fun ^_^ . I hope at least
[09:27]  * Tachyon` gives up and just tries it and prepares a lot of cursing in case his system ends up unbootable
=== apodio is now known as nooooooooiz
[09:28] <menace> *sigh* I know that 14.10 is not released yet.... I don't want to complain, i just ask, if anyone knows this behaviour. if not, i surely will look for a bug, or even open one...
[09:28] <blubaustin> ikonia Have is it very difficult to setup or is it pretty easy? I'm trying to make it where each user can access their home folder.
=== raz1 is now known as Raz1
[09:29] <cfhowlett> menace, and ALL of that can and should be discussed in #ubuntu+1
[09:29] <somsip> menace: try in 14.10. That's where users of 14.10 are
[09:29] <blubaustin> So if one person is on one computer they can still access files on the other computer
[09:29] <somsip> menace: s/14.10/#ubuntu+1 ...
[09:29] <menace> thanks :)
[09:29] <menace> that's a better place, i agree
[09:29] <ikonia> blubaustin: doddle
[09:29] <blubaustin> I do want security though which is whats bothering me with the guide its wanting everyone to access it instead of authentication
[09:30] <Raz1> So, should I ask MIR questions in this channel or 14.10 - or something completely different?
=== helpme is now known as Guest57281

[09:32] <blubaustin> Why not
[09:32] <blubaustin> I have backups
[09:32] <ikonia> blubaustin: because it's pre-release, it breaks it is unstable
[09:32] <blubaustin> read above ^
[09:32] <ikonia> blubaustin: ok, then please join #ubuntu+1 for 14.10 discussion
[09:32] <cfhowlett> blubaustin, AND it's not supported here so >>> #ubuntu+1 for support please
[09:32] <blubaustin> So to me if I can help the team, and other people can its worth it
[09:32] <ikonia> blubaustin: this channel only suppors the stable release
[09:32] <blubaustin> crap >_>
[09:33] <PechosRey> can someone tell me how the new autostart of services in ubuntu 14.04 works?
[09:33] <PechosRey> the rc.local is empty
[09:34] <PechosRey> my samba autostarts with 14.04 but i can find out where to deactivate the samba service
[09:34] <ikonia> it uses upstart
[09:34] <ikonia> that's the init system
[09:34] <blubaustin> delete it in the /etc/init.d/
[09:35] <ikonia> rc.local is only for very specific and pretty much obsolete stuff now
[09:35] <ikonia> do not delete it
[09:35] <ikonia> do not delete init scripts

[09:36] <blubaustin> ?!
[09:36] <PechosRey> ah great there is a samba autostart script thx a lot
[09:36] <Raz1> They can be disabled
[09:36] <ikonia> disable init jobs using upstart
[09:36] <ikonia> do not try to get around it
[09:36] <blubaustin> yes they can be disabled but I've always moved it or deleted it >_>
[09:36] <blubaustin> <_<
[09:36] <ikonia> then you have bad practices
[09:36] <ikonia> please don't offer them as solutions
[09:37] <PechosRey> where can i find upstart?
[09:37] <ikonia> PechosRey: it's an init system it's made up of a few components
[09:37] <ikonia> !upstart | PechosRey

=== sudhir_ is now known as nrange
[09:40] <Psil0Cybin> I just typed in free -m on a fresh install of Xubuntu and it says i have 0 swap 0 used 0 free, so i can assume I have no swap...why is this so, would it no task me to make a swap or make one automatically, if i just did a standard install when it erases everything?
[09:40] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, swap is not automatic
[09:40] <Raz1> upstart is going to be replaced eventually, by the way
[09:40] <cfhowlett> !swap | Psil0Cybin
[09:40] <ubottu> Psil0Cybin: swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[09:41] <Raz1> Psil0Cybin: It just means that your system hasn't needed to page anything yet because you have enough memory
[09:41] <Psil0Cybin> cfhowlett, would it get created automatically, if i need more memory
[09:41] <Psil0Cybin> even if total says 0?
[09:41] <Raz1> It's just the space used on the swap partition
[09:41] <PechosRey> it seems samba is not managed with upstart service
[09:42] <cynicallemon> i dont usually run with swap enabled due to having enough memory
[09:42] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, swap IS NOT created unless you choose to do so.  Did you?  If not = no swap.  Read the wiki and add one if you wish12
[09:42] <PechosRey> initctl list -> doesn`t list samba processes
[09:42] <Raz1> cynicallemon: It's kind of useful for hibernation though
[09:42] <Raz1> Psil0Cybin: Oh, sorry. I didn't see the 0 free part
[09:42] <Psil0Cybin> i did the whole LVM encrypted / home encrypted, it never gave an option for swap..it just gave me the option to create my own partitions or let the Install do its own thing.
[09:42] <cynicallemon> Raz1: yes maybe for laptops
[09:43] <cuddylier> Does anyone know how to apt-get install programs without it prompting for a yes/no? I need it not to for a bash script.
[09:43] <Psil0Cybin> so i clicked erase all previous partitions and do a fresh install
[09:43] <Psil0Cybin> so i thought it would create a swap just incase...
[09:43] <Psil0Cybin> like in 12.04..
[09:43] <Raz1> cynicallemon: Especiall so, but I use it for desktops aswell in order to keep session state
[09:43] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, don't feel bad.  I just installed my 14.04 upgrade and manage to forget to set the swap partition.  It's present from 12.04 but I didn't assign it so = no swap.  Easily fixed thought
[09:43] <Raz1> cynicallemon: No real need to shut down your system if you don't have to
[09:44] <winem> cuddylier: use -y
[09:44] <cuddylier> winem: Thanks
[09:44] <winem> this will automatically answer the question with yes and skips the prompt
[09:44] <devlin> what if it's installed on tablet
=== Pupeno_ is now known as Pupeno
[09:44] <Psil0Cybin> cfhowlett, is it easy to create an encrypted swap in 14.04 and link it in? or is that not as easily fixed lol?
[09:44] <cynicallemon> Raz1: i dont worry about that on laptops anyway as i shut mine down anyway, always have
[09:45] <smittix> Has anyone experienced boot problems when installing Nvidia drivers?
[09:45] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, all I can suggest is read the swap wiki.  I just verified that my 12.04 /swap is present, so I' need to boot a USB and then do some mtab/fstab assignments or something.  seems caveman easy ...
[09:46] <Psil0Cybin> Okay ty.

[09:55] <irgendwer4711> hello, anyone using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with openssl/postfix, havin this error in log: ccs received early?

[09:58] <H4ml3t> cuddylier, can I advice you to use a Perl script?
[09:58] <irgendwer4711> cfhowlett: there seems to be a bug regression with TLS
[09:58] <H4ml3t> is much more easy
[09:59] <cuddylier> H4ml3t Is it similar to bash in terms of simplicity for comands?
[09:59] <cuddylier> commands*
[09:59] <irgendwer4711> maybe encryption is worthless
[09:59] <cfhowlett> irgendwer4711, over my head.  ask #ubuntu-server
[09:59] <irgendwer4711> cfhowlett: do you use this version with postfix?=
[09:59] <H4ml3t> the syntax is different, but not too much!
[09:59] <cfhowlett> irgendwer4711, no server on my machine.   you might ask in the server channel.
[10:00] <H4ml3t> you can just focus on what you have to do, without learning all the language
[10:00] <H4ml3t> maybe you can write a little perl script and execute it inside you bash script
[10:01] <irgendwer4711> cfhowlett: did
[10:04] <irgendwer4711> cfhowlett: may I should ask some dev?
[10:04] <cfhowlett> irgendwer4711, pretty sure the first thing they'll they'd suggest is upgrade to 14.04 --- as do I.  10.04 support ends in 2 months.
[10:05] <irgendwer4711> cfhowlett: lts ends in april 2015
[10:05] <cfhowlett> and an upgrade may easily fix the problem.
[10:05] <cuddylier> For exiting mysql in my bash script, you would usually use 'exit' normally but I can't do that can I in a script as exit is a function too?

[10:22] <blaab> CM108 audio controller analog stereo. However, I don't hear any sound even after setting audio at 145%
[10:22] <blaab> and the mic isn't detected either. Could someone help out here?
[10:25] <Ja[r]od> hi mom!
[10:26] <delf_> hi guys! i'm trying to install puppet 2.7 on my ubuntu 14.04 box...i created a pref-file in /etc/apt/preferences.d, but somehow it seems like apt ignores it...any ideas what i could have done wrong?
[10:26] <mlody> Hi guys, What are default permissions and owners to /var/log in ubuntu 14.04? In my install i have 775 root syslog which causes my logratate to fail
[10:27] <ChaosBringer> Hello all. I have about 6 LVs that I seem to be running into some small issues with
[10:27] <ChaosBringer> @ mlody drwxrwxr-x 15 root syslog   4096 Aug 13 08:03 log
[10:28] <ChaosBringer> So, I noticed I have duplicate entries in proc/mounts
[10:28] <ChaosBringer> for some of my Logical Volumes
[10:28] <ChaosBringer> they also do not seem to be automounted or unmounted
[10:28] <ChaosBringer> on boot and shutdown, even though they are in /etc/fstab
[10:28] <ChaosBringer> any ideas?
[10:30] <mlody> do you think that somethink can go wrong when i set chmod 755 /var/log ?
[10:32] <ChaosBringer> why wouldn't you give whatever user is running logrotate
[10:32] <Ja[r]od> mlody: yup
[10:32] <ChaosBringer> you add whatever user to the syslog group
[10:32] <ChaosBringer> instead of messing with permissions in / :)
[10:32] <k1l> mlody: 775 root:syslog is fine for /var/log/ . but the files in there have different permissions
[10:32] <ChaosBringer> anyone have any idea about dupes in /proc/mounts concerning LVM?
[10:32] <k1l> mlody: did you fiddle with the permissions in there already?
[10:33] <ChaosBringer> ubuntu 14.04
[10:33] <mlody> k1l, 775 isnt fine in case of my logrotate
[10:34] <mlody> error: skipping "/var/log/tarara.log" because parent directory has insecure permissions (It's world writable or writable by group which is not "root")
[10:34] <mlody> when i run logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/tararar
[10:34] <mlody> it clearly says that /var/log is writable by group
[10:34] <mlody> and this causes the error
[10:34] <ChaosBringer> right
[10:35] <ChaosBringer> you have given too broad permissions
[10:35] <ChaosBringer> to tarara.log
[10:35] <ChaosBringer> syslog is the default group
[10:35] <ChaosBringer> that the folder belongs to
[10:36] <TJ-> mlody: It sounds as if logrotate isn't being run as the syslog user, but as root
[10:36] <mlody> TJ-, in logrotate.conf: su root syslog
[10:36] <ChaosBringer> ^ probably right
[10:36] <mlody> directive is set
[10:36] <TJ-> mlody: That's correct .... have you got any logrotate customisations?
[10:36] <mlody> may this be the problem?
[10:36] <k1l> mlody: what program gives that error? 755 is the regular ubunut setup
[10:36] <ChaosBringer> anyone know why my LVM partitions are not automounting (they are in /etc/fstab) and I have dupes in /proc/mounts?
[10:37] <mlody> k1l, logrotate gives it
[10:37] <TJ-> My systems /var/log/ are 775 root:syslog
[10:37] <k1l> mlody: not on a regular ubuntu
[10:37] <mlody> btw. when I add this directive to the conf for tararara the it is ok
[10:37] <mlody> and it rotates the log
[10:37] <k1l> mlody: which ubuntu is that exactly?
[10:37] <mlody> Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS \n \l
[10:38] <k1l> so 775 is all fine
[10:39] <InsaneReality> Hi, after upgrading to Trusty, Gnome-shell is acting very sluggish, with windows getting stuck or twitching. What should I do?
[10:39] <TJ-> mlody: What is the owner:group of tarara.log?
[10:39] <k1l> InsaneReality: try a different user to see if it is some user setting (old theme, old config etc)
[10:40] <mlody> -rw-------  1 root    root
[10:40] <EriC^^> mlody:  try setting the group to syslog?
[10:40] <InsaneReality> k1l: Ok, I will try that. Just in case that issue doesn't happen with a new user, what should I do?
[10:41] <TJ-> mlody: I think you need a custom "/etc/logrotate.d/<daemon_name>" with "/var/log/tarara.log { ... su root root }"  in
[10:41] <k1l> InsaneReality: good question. i would consider to reset the user configurations from gnome desktop.
[10:42] <TJ-> mlody: That... or change the group ownership of tarara.log to syslog
[10:43] <InsaneReality> k1l: Can you tell me how to reset user config please?
[10:43] <mlody> TJ-, yup. I have custom config. When i add there a directive "su root syslog" then it rotates the log. Also when i change /var/log permissions to 755 instead of 775 it works aswell. We have big environment and its easier to change in ansible single config (to change /var/log) instead of all logrotate configs
[10:43] <mlody> TJ-, i wonder wheter there will be some porlbmes with /var/log chmoded to 755
[10:43] <mlody> (as it was in ubuntu 13.04 for example)
[10:43] <frib> when i run sudo pm-hibernate, the screen just flashes and pc doesn't shut off .. how can I make hibernate work?
[10:44] <EriC^^> frib: do you have a swap partition?
[10:45] <TJ-> mlody: There could be, the point of the group rw is that daemons can drop root privs but still have access to write logs
[10:45] <k1l> InsaneReality: see f that helps: http://askubuntu.com/questions/56313/how-do-i-reset-gnome-to-the-defaults
[10:46] <InsaneReality> k1l: Thanks a lot. :)
[10:46] <frib> EriC^^, one sec, checking
[10:47] <frib> EriC^^, it seems I dont
[10:48] <EriC^^> frib: you need a swap partition/file to hibernate
[10:48] <AMD-Z> frib: that's what I told you yesterday too
[10:48] <frib> EriC^^, atm i have a boot/efi partition (fat32) and a root partition ext4
[10:48] <frib> AMD-Z, i thought i had one
[10:49] <k1l> you can only standby without a swap partition
[10:49] <frib> with this new laptop the install was some weird efi thing that I had never seen before and i couldn't partition things the way I wanted to
[10:49] <k1l> frib: "sudo fdisk -l" will tell you
[10:50] <frib> my ram is 12 gb but gparted says i have 11.93 gb of free disk space
[10:51] <InsaneReality> One more question: Something has happened while upgrading to 14.04 that libreoffice-base is showing as half-installed and it remains in its old precise version without updating to the trusty one. Is there a way to solve that?
[10:52] <EriC^^> frib: you mean unallocated space?
[10:52] <frib> EriC^^, gparted called it "unknown" so i just formatted it to swap
[10:52] <k1l> InsaneReality: run a "sudo apt-get udpate &&sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" and put the whole output into a pastebin please
[10:52] <frib> but despite gparted showing 3 partitions, fdisk only shows 1 still
[10:53] <k1l> frib: dont just guess! pastebin the output and let the peer review it
[10:53] <TJ-> frib: That is because the disk using GPT, not MBR. With fdisk all you see is the Protective MBR... use "gdisk"
[10:53] <InsaneReality> k1l: Ok
[10:53] <k1l> else you may be deleting your stuff
[10:53] <EriC^^> frib: try parted -l
[10:54] <frib> EriC^^, that shows them all
=== rawagner is now known as rawagner_afk
[10:54] <frib> so now that i have a swap i should try to hibernate again?
[10:54] <EriC^^> np
[10:54] <EriC^^> *no
[10:54] <EriC^^> first does it say the partition is linux-swap ? (under filesystem)
[10:54] <frib> linux-swap(v1)
[10:55] <EriC^^> ok
[10:55] <EriC^^> type swapon /dev/sdxY
[10:55] <EriC^^> where sdxY is the swap
[10:55] <frib> done
[10:56] <TJ-> frib: the swap partition needs to be slightly larger than installed RAM for hibernation to work, for an 8GB RAM PC I needed to allocate 8.25GB to the swap partition
[10:56] <frib> TJ-, my ubuntu system info lists my ram as 11.7GB and parted -l lists the swap partition as 12.8GB
[10:56] <EriC^^> now type blkid
[10:56] <TJ-> frib: That looks about right
[10:56] <EriC^^> and get the UUID
[10:56] <frib> got it
[10:57] <EriC^^> sudo nano /etc/fstab
[10:57] <frib> ok
[10:57] <frib> im there
[10:58] <InsaneReality> k1l: Here's the paste: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8044367/ . I entered Y when it asked me to upgrade.
[10:58] <EriC^^> add this UUID=UUIDhere    none    swap    sw      0   0
[11:00] <iptable> please also note that you need more than "slightly" bigger swap than ram. linux by default will swap out unused memory to swap, so you may end up with your ram + 1GB of swap utilised after a few hours of doing certain things. A good rule of thumb is SWAP=RAM*1.5. So for 12GB RAM, have at least 18GB SWAP. that will ensure you can hibernate after a few days of not rebooting
[11:00] <frib> EriC^^, done
[11:01] <EriC^^> ok, sudo nano /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume
[11:01] <frib> iptable, then iwill have to shrink my os partition
[11:02] <frib> EriC^^, there
[11:02] <EriC^^> add this RESUME=UUID=UUIDhere
[11:02] <frib> done
[11:02] <iptable> just a note ;) free -m can tell you if you have enough swap free. you need swap free = your ram size + a few MB in order to be able to hibernate
[11:03] <frib> http://paste.ubuntu.com/8044419/
[11:03] <EriC^^> then sudo update-initramfs -u
[11:03] <frib> done
[11:03] <EriC^^> ok, you're good
[11:04] <EriC^^> pm-hibernate
[11:05] <frib> am i still here
[11:05] <EriC^^> ok, you need to restart i think
[11:05] <k1l> InsaneReality: you use libreoffice from a PPA and that PPA is broken
[11:05] <frib> the hibernate seemed to work
[11:05] <frib> the pc shut off
[11:05] <frib> i'm just surprised i didn't get disconnected from irc
[11:05] <k1l> !info libreoffice-base | InsaneReality see the package version
[11:05] <ubottu> InsaneReality see the package version: libreoffice-base (source: libreoffice): office productivity suite -- database. In component main, is optional. Version 1:4.2.4-0ubuntu2 (trusty), package size 1366 kB, installed size 5192 kB
[11:06] <EriC^^> maybe cause the connection didn't timeout yet
[11:06] <frib> ok so then all is good
[11:06] <EriC^^> my wifi goes away sometimes, and when its back i resume in irc
[11:06] <frib> can i just ask -- all that i just did, did it fix my problem of not being able to come back from suspend also?
[11:07] <InsaneReality> k1l: So what should I do now?
[11:07] <k1l> remove that PPA with ppa-purge
[11:07] <EriC^^> no idea
[11:07] <frib> ok hopefully it did
[11:07] <k1l> !ppa-purge | InsaneReality
[11:07] <ubottu> InsaneReality: To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: <unconvertable> sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> <unconvertable> <unconvertable> For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html
[11:07] <frib> and now hibernate shows up in the gui shutdown options too so that's good
[11:07] <frib> thanks for the help
[11:07] <InsaneReality> k1l: Ok I will do that
[11:07] <EriC^^> np

[11:22] <popl> I'd like to install Apache Solr. I have been comparing Tomcat vs. Jetty. So far I have noticed that solr-tomcat requires tomcat6, which is at version 6.0.39 (which is a version that has multiple security issues). For that reason I am now considering using solr-jetty. Is Jetty preferred for using Solr with Ubuntu?

[11:41] <theadmin> anuvrat: You can't "fix" it, 13.X is EOL.
[11:41] <theadmin> anuvrat: You have to upgrade to install packages.
[11:43] <theadmin> anuvrat: For general use, stick to EOL versions (12.04, 14.04, 16.04, 18.04 and so on). Only use non-LTS if you want to play with new features.
[11:45] <theadmin> Err
[11:45] <k1l> anuvrat: the repos get shut down after its even too late to have a secure system due to stopped updates. so better stick with LTS in first place. you got 5 years support on that
