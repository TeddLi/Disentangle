[08:01] <jsestri2> crouton: trying...
[08:01] <Vashypooh> is it possible to login to X like this? or just this
[08:02] <wastrel> `JD:  did you copy the conf file you changed over to /etc/X11/xorg.conf  (keeping a backup of the origial xorg.conf , of course)
[08:02] <wastrel> Vashypooh:  that's what VNC is for
[08:02] <Vashypooh> I see
[08:02] <crouton> jsestri2: so it was the hotplug that was preventing Xorg from running successfully?

[08:02] <jdumont> is remote desktop similair to vnc?
[08:02] <iceman> can you apt-get vnc ?
[08:03] <jsestri2> crouton: no...i have been running the on-board sound disabled since we started talking
[08:03] <wastrel> jdumont:  i don't know what remote desktop is :]
[08:03] <`JD> I edit xorg.conf directly, I still have the back up
[08:03] <crouton> jsestri2: Ahh. Interesting.
[08:03] <Xenguy> iceman: yep
[08:03] <jsestri2> crouton: the xorg stuff was fixed with the reconfigure you suggested
[08:03] <wastrel> `JD:  and you restarted after changing it?
[08:03] <intelikey> wastrel caution.  if there is an xorg.conf in the $PWD and you run startx it will read that one rather than the one in /etc/X11/    i had a big fight with that the other day.
[08:03] <Vashypooh> iceman that didnt work
[08:03] <jdumont> well i'm scouring my install and came across remote desktop
[08:03] <crouton> jsestri2: Excellent, that's good news.
[08:03] <iceman> Xenguy apt-get what ?
[08:03] <jsestri2> crouton: I have now moved onto trying to get it to work wtih my on-board sound
[08:03] <wastrel> intelikey:  i don't think he knows the startx command but thx for the tip :]
[08:04] <jdumont> i'll fire up xp and see if i can login to remote desktop
[08:04] <jsestri2> crouton: it dosent show up under lspci (i'd assume because its not enabled)
[08:04] <iceman> sorry, samba cant see it, vnc will let me log in and xfer the dockuments i need

[08:05] <jsestri2> crouton: i'm pretty sure its Realtek

[08:08] <intelikey> RichART1 if you are going to use the linux partition/s simple wat is mkfs.ext3 the partition.  else  c/fdisk  is the answer.     but be advised that if you use grub you may not be able to boot after such actions.

[08:22] <OmegaAlpha> wastrel, is the only way to use linux on ext hd. is if it is able to boot from the BIOS?
[08:22] <biovore> (minus the . in the begining)

[08:22] <wisie> crouton: Nope I havnt yet, thats the weird thing :/

[08:23] <damian_> thanks
[08:23] <biovore> try google next time
[08:23] <Vashypooh> wastrel: any idea of how to fix this?
[08:23] <iceman> This installation doesn't support glibc-2.0 on Linux / x86_64
[08:23] <iceman> (tried to run setup)
[08:23] <jdumont> you mean i spent half a day trying to get vnc to work and here it is already installed by default!  <sigh>

[08:24] <damian_> and alot quicker than google

[08:24] <iceman> looks like ill have to install 32 bit chrood ... or just install 32 bit linux
[08:25] <wisie> crouton: brings up a list of commands, i might give it a look :)
[08:25] <jdumont> i'll see if logging off solves the house of mirrors.
[08:25] <wastrel> Vashypooh:  sorry i don't know
[08:25] <jsestri2> crouton: i edit it, and it appears to stay, and then i back up and boot my kernel, but it drops the nohotplug part of it
[08:25] <biovore> iceman: look around.. I think there is a amd64 bin for RTCW

[08:25] <damian_> for certain things it is
[08:25] <wastrel> Vashypooh:  there are font lines in your xorg.conf file - you may be able to figure out what to change it to
[08:25] <iceman> biovore have not seen one .
[08:25] <jsestri2> crouton: ooo, i guess i misread what you said. You said not to use b, but if i use enter is all good?

[08:56] <jsestri2> intelikey: the startup hangs at "starting hotplug subsystem" if my onboard Realtek audio is enabled
[08:57] <intelikey> jsestri2 oh you are not trying to get sound working... you are trying to get init booted.   ok.
[08:57] <Vashypooh> sudo /etc/init.d/inetd restart doesnt do anything
[08:57] <MaxeyPad> just curious, but what effect will google's support for google have directly? Are they funding R&D now or what exactly
[08:58] <intelikey> jsestri2 which do you want to use   hotplug  or  the onboard sound ?      and if you say both, then get someone else to help ya fix it :)
[08:59] <jsestri2> intelikey: well, from what i've been told, turning off hotplug is a bad decision except for trying things out, so i guess the answer is both

[09:35] <djs_2_6> graveson - when you first boot up it gives you the option of accessing the loader.  I think you can get to an emergency mode and you should be able to get a terminal from there...
