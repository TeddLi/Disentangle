[20:09] <roasted> Question - I just installed two 3TB HDDs. They have GPT tables as per GParted from Lubuntu LiveUSB 12.04. In GParted, the first sector is listed as 2048. However, if I run fdisk -l against them even though fdisk isn't supported for larger disks, it says the first sector is 1. Why is fdisk reporting 1 while gparted is reporting 2048?
[20:10] <przemek> hello do you know guys how to format usb drive in ubuntu?
[20:10] <zykotick9> roasted: don't use fdisk.  end of story.
[20:10] <roasted> zykotick9: :D
[20:10] <zykotick9> roasted: parted -l does same as fdisk -l
[20:10] <roasted> zykotick9: is there an equivalent to "fdisk -l" for gdisk or parted?
[20:11] <roasted> bingo
[20:11] <roasted> nailed it. appreciate it zykotick9
[20:11] <DuncanNZ> przemek gparted
[20:11] <przemek> :D
[20:11] <roasted> zykotick9: parted -l reports my "start" as 1049kB...

[20:12] <roasted> zykotick9: ah okay
[20:13] <mibofra> Can I ask for a problem of supybot plugin PackageInfo ?
[20:13] <roasted> zykotick9: I just wanted to make sure things were aligned properly. I kept hearing 2048 was the first sector that should be written to, which is what gparted reports but this 1049kB for parted confuswed me.

[21:34] <Bubo> No Pici
[21:34] <Bubo> no virtualenv
[21:34] <Pici> Bubo: Is there a reason you're not using the package in the repositories?
[21:35] <Bubo> What package Pici
[21:35] <Bubo> It says "The required version of distribute (>=0.6.28) is not available," and in the paste I gave you, the first command installs a version higher than that one.. Which is weird

[21:47] <ThinkT510> source_: perhaps your mouse is just too awesome for your desktop to handle
[21:47] <Bubo> Ok Pici. Any idea for my other problem??
[21:48] <source_> Hahaha I wish. It only clicks certain windows. Unless i log out and login. Then it works fine.
[21:48] <nibbler>  i'm just migrating to digikam, was using f-spot before. when importing my collections, sometimes the tags, saved in Subject (XMP i assume) like "tag1, tag2, tag3" get imported as ONE tag, sometimes they get split, resulting in three distinct tags. how to make it distinct tags everytime?
[21:50] <dartos> What video drivers should I get for the GTX560Ti?
[21:50] <dartos> The only drivers I see on the software center say they are for gtx 600+
[21:52] <daftykins> dartos: doesn't matter. those'll be fine.
[21:52] <Castial> hey I have a Gnome-shell/Unity issue and its an issue on both machines
[21:53] <Castial> I need to add wine to the "open with" as default
[21:53] <dave_ubuntu> hi, whenever i try and install the 13.1 catalyst drivers for my ati4850, it'll create an xorg.conf and when i reboot it'll make my monitors out of range on the login screen, if i remove the xorg it still doesn't work. any help?
[21:53] <dartos> daftykins: I think I'll try the ones from their site. I didn't know they had Linux versions from the geforce site. Sorry for the bother
[21:54] <daftykins> dartos: i'd recommend using the hardware drivers over downloading manually. APT is healthier
[21:54] <dartos> daftykins: What do you mean APT? I am pretty new to linux...
[21:55] <daftykins> dartos: it's the way software packages are downloaded and installed automagically
[21:55] <Castial> dave_ubuntu, you have odd monitors probably try opening the xorg.conf files with a text editor, and set the htz to 60 and set the resolution to what it is the monitors are suppose to have
[21:55] <dartos> Oh
[21:55] <dartos> apt-get
[21:55] <Castial> simply deleting the xorg will recreate it with the ati drivers
[21:55] <daftykins> dartos: yep. just try the latest version the hardware drivers program offers you and see how it goes
[21:56] <dartos> I had to get that additional drivers program from the software center
[21:56] <Castial> how do I add Wine to the programs list, there is no "use custom command" anymore
[21:56] <dartos> but there are 4 drivers in that thing...
[21:56] <dartos> 2 beta and 2 non-beta
[21:56] <dave_ubuntu> Castial, I've tried that. Gave them a VertRefresh (iirc) for my range.
[21:56] <Castial> you dont need to
[21:56] <dartos> daftykins: your talking about jockey-kde right?
[21:56] <Castial> just set it to 6-htz
[21:56] <Castial> 60 rather
[21:56] <Bubo> How do I fix this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1587061/ - thanks
[21:57] <Castial> and set it to the proper resolution
[21:57] <ubuntu346> im trying to recover a RAID0 array, using testdisk, after resetting it through RAID BIOS - but testdisk is accessing the disk with CHS 34632452345 1 1 - and throwing warnings left and right, about incorrect sectors and/or heads... would these errors keep me from finding my original partitions ?
[21:57] <dave_ubuntu> my monitor doesn't support 60, that's the issue
[21:57] <daftykins> dartos: sure
[21:57] <Castial> then get a better monitor
[21:57] <dave_ubuntu> its 70-85 by the looks.
[21:57] <Castial> then set it to 85
[21:57] <dave_ubuntu> yeah i'll do just that
[21:57] <daftykins> dave_ubuntu: is it a CRT?
[21:57] <Castial> if its crt it supports as low as 56
[21:57] <dave_ubuntu> its 2 x flat
[21:58] <daftykins> all LCDs support 59/60
[21:58] <Castial> if none of the higher ones work, set it to 56
[21:59] <Castial> daftykins, not all some only support "56" but are oh heavens whats that word
[21:59] <Castial> there is no refresh rate per say and its set to 56
[21:59] <dartos> daftykins: it seems that the driver install failed
[21:59] <Castial> how do I get the latest nvidia drivers
[21:59] <daftykins> Castial: yeah. never seen 56 :O that's a new one on me and i've seen a lot
[21:59] <OerHeks> Castial, resetting the monitor with its own menu might help
[22:00] <Castial> I had them installed through the terminal and an update broke them
[22:00] <Castial> so I had to revert to the 304 ones
[22:00] <Castial> is there a deb of the 310 ones?
[22:02] <dartos> I tried installing the nvidia drivers but it failed :'(
[22:02] <dartos> here is the log from jockey
[22:02] <dartos> http://pastebin.com/i6xUgy6U
[22:02] <Castial> oh ok they are in the repositories as "experimental"
[22:02] <Castial> cool
[22:02] <dartos> If anyone would be so kind to help me out
[22:02] <Castial> remove the nvidia drivers

[22:28] <Castial> how do I add it to the other programs list
[22:29] <Castial> there is no "use command" button anymore
[22:29] <Castial> what do I do?
[22:29] <Castial> it is the same on both Gnome-Shell and Unity
[22:30] <ZeloZelos> Castial, the run command is still there, hit the window button, type run...if i remember correctly..havent used it in a while
[22:31] <Castial> I wish they would allow me to "create link"
[22:31] <Castial> why the hell did canonical remove that
[22:31] <Castial> its so damn annoying
[22:31] <ZeloZelos> drag n drop to desktop makes links still i think
[22:31] <Castial> nope just a copy
[22:32] <Castial> I make a link, and if the link isnt in the folder it doesnt work
[22:32] <Castial> they took a completely workable system and completely broke it
[22:32] <Castial> ok cool I got the link on the desktop
[22:33] <Castial> but there is no way to change the options anymore
[22:33] <dave_ubuntu> it was the resolution that needed to be defined and used with the aticonfig tool
[22:33] <Castial> it used to be easy god
[22:33] <dave_ubuntu> fun tmes
[22:33] <ZeloZelos> Castial, maybe you will like mint better instead
[22:33] <dave_ubuntu> cheers for the help guys
[22:33] <Castial> dave_ubuntu, same for Nvidia
[22:33] <Castial> ZeloZelos, ill give it a go later
[22:34] <dave_ubuntu> when in doubt, build your own closed source undocumented tool
[22:34] <Castial> it just seems ass backwards to not allow me to make desktop icons to applications
[22:34] <Castial> dave_ubuntu, same for Windows, OSX, Hurd, and any other system
[22:34] <Castial> even Intel has a tool now iirc
[22:35] <dave_ubuntu> you don't **need** one in windows
[22:35] <dave_ubuntu> for special driver specific stuff maybe
[22:35] <Castial> dave_ubuntu, because Microsoft dictates to them "you MUST use our system" on Linux hardware vendors have the freedom to do that
[22:35] <Castial> hence the term "freedom"
[22:35] <dave_ubuntu> indeed
[22:36] <Castial> I mean if thats your biggest annoyance you have other issues to learn like the fact they need you to add a repository to use up to date software
[22:37] <Castial> they need to keep the software in the repos more up to date
[22:37] <Castial> its annoying as piss to have 100000 repos for all the apps I use when 1 repository should do it
[22:37] <Castial> that was what they were meant to do, they were meant to remove confusion

[22:38] <Castial> 1 repo to rule them all

[22:38] <Castial> it removed codecs
[22:39] <Castial> it removed anything that wasnt disney friendly

[22:41] <spydmobile> Hi folks, I have a headscratcher and need some bright ideas. I have a ubuntu server: Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-36-generic x86_64) that has a nealy full root partiton but for the life of me I have tried every trick I know to find why or how, but I cannot seem to find the bloat.
[22:41] <beandog> how full is full
[22:42] <spydmobile> beandog: /dev/mapper/smvmbackup64-root      15G   14G  373M  98% /
[22:42] <beandog> eh
[22:42] <beandog> that's normal
[22:42] <beandog> but install ncdu and run it at / and you can poke around to see what's using the most
[22:42] <beandog> If I had to guess, I'd say /home /var/log /tmp and /var/tmp
[22:42] <Castial> my gentoo server uses like 90% all the time for temp files
[22:43] <SolarisB1y> Castial: do you really think one repo is the answer to that?
[22:43] <Castial> clear your temp files and get janitor
[22:43] <beandog> Castial: tmpwatch ftw
[22:43] <Castial> beandog, that too
[22:43] <beandog> never used janitor
[22:43] <bipul> Castial, ?
[22:43] <Castial> janitor is a front end with some custom commands
[22:43] <Castial> same thing as tmpwatch but for other things
[22:43] <SolarisB1y> it seems like ubuntu like all other distros controls versions of software uploaded to their repo - i think it's normal and without it if those ppa versions got pushed to standard repos everyone would have a broken system
[22:44] <Castial> no we wouldnt
[22:44] <SDr> hello. using the command-line mail program, how can I scroll down in the list of incoming mails? (ie: got more, than 200 mails in there, need to check latest ones)
[22:44] <Castial> not if they did it right
[22:44] <spydmobile> beandog: ncdu shows my /usr at 650mb and my /var at 495mb
[22:44] <beandog> spydmobile: yah, that's a gig total, that's not much
[22:44] <SolarisB1y> which would in turn be making the core libraries unstable to do it "right"
[22:45] <Castial> not core libraries but applications
[22:45] <SolarisB1y> when each ppa pulls in it's own list of deps etc its gonna break stuff
[22:45] <Castial> like gimp wasnt the latest for over a year after its release
[22:45] <SolarisB1y> apps end up depending on core libraries somwehere it can't be prevented
[22:45] <bipul> is there any one who has performed network simulation emulation in ubuntu.
[22:45] <spydmobile> beandog: exactly, I have scoured and cant find anything even remotely big enough, this was a fresh install with a hand full of thingks like openssh etc...
[22:45] <Castial> I suppose its still annoyingly broken
[22:46] <chris__> Does anyone know how I can change the user that an upstart service is run as?
[22:46] <beandog> spydmobile: oh yah?  Hmm, because I generally do about 15G for a fresh install too.  You said server, right?
[22:46] <spydmobile> ?q
[22:46] <Castial> later peeps been real helping and all
[22:46] <SolarisB1y> install x and it wants to install it's own version of a-lib b-lib etc. where a-lib and b-lib required by app c which is also system app - broken system - there needs to be a working location to start from, thats why they did ppa's to let you break your own systems
[22:46] <beandog> Castial: laters
[22:46] <SolarisB1y> peace
[22:46] <spydmobile> bea
[22:46] <spydmobile> beandog: sorry, you mean a base server install should hover near 15GB?
[22:47] <beandog> spydmobile: no, I was saying I'd probably do the same thing
[22:47] <beandog> spydmobile: a 15gb root install

[22:53] <xibalba> hey folks, anyone know if there is an Ubuntu OVF I can deploy quickly?
[22:54] <millennia> what is OVF?
[22:54] <xibalba> I dont want to have to run through the installer
[22:54] <xibalba> OVF = Open Virtual Format
[22:54] <xibalba> like a VM template
[22:54] <millennia> are you doing mass deployment to identical machines?
[22:55] <xibalba> no, i just need one handy because i generally quickly deploy an ubuntu box, test something, throw it away
[22:55] <xibalba> I can make my own, figured someone might have one already
[22:55] <jhutchins_wk> xibalba: So make your own.
[22:55] <xibalba> jhutchins_wk, well that requires more time than i obviously wanted to invest...
[22:55] <xibalba> jhutchins_wk, wonderful input btw, very helpful
[22:56] <Dessimat0r> i have no /etc/init.d/ssh or no /etc/init.d/sshd or /etc/init/ssh or /etc/init/sshd file with openssh-server installed on 12.10. What to do?
[22:56] <Dessimat0r> i reinstalled openssh-server
[22:56] <Dessimat0r> and nothing happened
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> i expect that the upstart script to detect ssh is missing
[22:57] <jrib> Dessimat0r: you have no idea why this is?
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> for whatever reason
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> but how to put that back?
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> i guess it is because of some hard disk corruption i suffered a while back
[22:57]  * xibalba throws jhutchins_wk a few packets to eat
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> but what package needs reinstalling in that case?
[22:57] <jrib> Dessimat0r: just purge openssh-server and install it again
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> something that handles the upstart init scripts
[22:58] <Dessimat0r> i did apt-get install openssh-server --reinstall
[22:58] <jrib> Dessimat0r: ok, now purge and install it again
[22:58] <Dessimat0r> that isn't the same as a purge/install?
[22:58] <Dessimat0r> ok
[22:58] <malkauns> in 12.10 why do i have no compress dialog when i want to compress a file in nautilus?
[22:58] <malkauns> nothing pops up
[22:59] <OerHeks>           xibalba , scroll down vor .ovf image >>> http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/quantal/current/
[23:00] <OerHeks> *for
[23:00] <xibalba> OerHeks, thank you sir I appreciate the response
[23:00] <OerHeks> change quantal to precise for the 12.04 lts version
[23:00] <spydmobile> beandog: Wow, I found it - crazy. somehow, my huge backup partion must have not been mounted and a huge backup was made to the mountpoint then later when the backup partion was mounted and emptied, it hid the 12 gig of files backup there!!!!
[23:01] <spydmobile> cd ..
[23:01] <xibalba> jhutchins_wk, learn from OerHeks
[23:02] <agrestringere_> ThinkT150 solved my issue today with the libc6 broken download wanted to thank the room #ubuntu for the help
[23:04] <xibalba> jhutchins_wk, you must be bitter living in Kansas
[23:15] <Rayshi> Hello I'm a new ubuntu user, I've been having problems to install ubuntu on my computer. I had some issue which I pinpointed to my Ahci and I was led to believe using the option acpi=off should fix it. And it did for that issue. But now a new error has shown up http://imgur.com/PPxTVqI this screen just flashes until I shut down the pc. Thanks for any help ahead of time

[23:24] <Rayshi> any other official channels where I may find some help regarding my issue?
[23:24] <Chriys> what is your issue Rayshi
[23:25] <Rayshi> I've been having problems to install ubuntu on my computer. I had some issue which I pinpointed to my Ahci and I was led to believe using the option acpi=off should fix it. And it did for that issue. But now a new error has shown up http://imgur.com/PPxTVqI this screen just flashes until I shut down the pc. Thanks for any help ahead of time
[23:25] <beandog> Rayshi: kernel panic.  That sucks.  Which version are you installing
[23:25] <Rayshi> 12.10 i believe the lastest stable
[23:25] <ekristen> is there any tool out there to manage a apt repository via a GUI or web interface? following that question I'm looking at running dozens of ubuntu servers internally, is there a way to have an APT mirror, but where I can approve packages before they show up in the mirror?
[23:26] <beandog> Rayshi: what kind of hardware
[23:27] <Rayshi> Beandog: EVGA X58 Classified3 samsung 830 128GB any other part in specific?
[23:28] <Chriys> ekriten: to generate repository here is a lin =>http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/
[23:28] <Chriys> ekristen but what is the exact issue that you have
[23:29] <Chriys> do you have a particular error message
[23:29] <beandog> Rayshi: yah, dunno.  I dunno where to start with that
[23:30] <Rayshi> I'm going to try to update the bios
[23:30] <Rayshi> see if that helps any
[23:30] <beandog> Rayshi: okay.  My first inclination was to say to reset the bios to factory defaults.  If you feel comfortable with that.
[23:31] <Chriys> me too.
[23:32] <Rayshi> beandog: well I think the problem might be on ahci but I have to use ahci for TRIM
[23:33] <remontees> €€€$$$
[23:35] <histo> Chriys: Also it's quite possible your ISP is block port 25 outbound
[23:36] <tab1293> I am trying to set up a pptp server on ubuntu but I am not sure what to use for the remote and local ip in pptpd.conf. here is my ifconfig output http://pastebin.ca/2308764
[23:36] <Chriys> histo: good remark. i have open the 25 on my router. do you know a way to verify that.
[23:38] <millennia> http://www.lunarforums.com/email_troubleshooting_and_tips/videotron_implements_outgoing_port_25_block-t26357.0.html
[23:39] <millennia> Chriys | yes it appear they did block port 25, and probably still do
[23:39] <Chriys> millenia thanks for the link. do you know if i can ask them to unblock it on my modem ?
[23:40] <histo> Chriys: A lot of ISP's block outbout port 25 to avoid people from setting up server to spam with.
[23:41] <Chriys> but question how thunderbird do to send email ?
[23:41] <histo> Chriys: becuase your isp's server is sending email out.  Not thunderbird
[23:41] <Chriys> histo: can i use another port instead of the 25 ?
[23:42] <millennia> Chriys | with a big isp like videotron, not much chance
[23:42] <millennia> Chriys | you can usually use port 465
[23:42] <barrett> my raid hard drives are beeping, this is not good, I rebooted and now the array didn't come up.  what can I do to test them?
[23:43] <millennia> Chriys | port 465 is smtp with ssl
[23:43] <Chriys> thanks millenia and how do i know if this port is open ?
[23:44] <histo> Chriys: I've only looked into setting up a mail server and understand the fundamentals. I've never actually done it. Because I was worried about spammers.  You may have better luck in #ubuntu-server.
[23:44] <Chriys> thanks histo
[23:44] <millennia> Chriys | you can tell if 465 is open by looking at videotron's faq, or by trying to use it with some mail server that offers ssl
[23:46] <_helios_> Finaly got my ssh server running had to change the port from 22 I think my ISP was blocking it.
[23:47] <histo> Chriys: You also might be able to use your isp's mail servers to relay messages
[23:48] <Chriys> that one can be cool histo
[23:50] <entreri> hey there, I added a new user and then deleted the old one. Now, I can't run sudo because my new user is not in sudoer file, the old user had administrator privilege... what can I do to grant privileges to new user ?
[23:50] <zykotick9> entreri: add the user to the sudo group (which might be tricky, as it requires sudo)
[23:51] <jrib> entreri: reboot in recovery mode to add the user to the sudo group
[23:51] <millennia> entreri | boot with the live cd and edit the group file
[23:52] <nIcestAdie> WOOOOO NICEST
[23:52] <entreri> lol, there is a way maybe to login as root ?
[23:52] <malkauns> in 12.10 how do i get empathy to remember my yahoo contacts?
[23:52] <jrib> entreri: reboot in recovery mode to add the user to the sudo group
[23:52] <ESphynx> hey guys, why is Quantal sooooo slow in VirtualBox ? And how do I disable these transitions or what not? clicking on a dock icon takes like 10 seconds with a super slow animation
[23:52] <ESphynx> note: I have 'animations' turned off in compiz settings manager
[23:52] <entreri> jrib: in recovery mode we have root access ?
[23:52] <jrib> entreri: yes
[23:53] <entreri> jrib: I will do that thanks
[23:53] <ESphynx> Quantal it's basically unusable in VirtualBox
[23:53] <Frozenthia> Hello, I have a graphics card: GeForce GTX 580 from NVIDIA. I'm using the latest Kubuntu version, for KDE. KDE freezes for nouveau, saying something like "nouveau lockup" if I give it a chance to blackscreen. It doesn't blackscreen at the logo fade, but it freezes.
[23:53] <jrib> I wonder if he knows how to add a user to a group
[23:54] <histo> ESphynx: That's possibly due to the removal of unity2d
[23:54] <ESphynx> histo why on earth would that be done
[23:54] <mattwj2002> hi guys ubuntu for android
[23:54] <ESphynx> histo know any work around?
[23:54] <mattwj2002> is that available yet?
[23:54] <mattwj2002> if so where is it at?
[23:55] <barrett> I'm really desperate is there anyone that can help me with my mdadm array not coming up?
[23:55] <Frozenthia> That was weird.
[23:55] <barrett> the hard drives seem to be making noises, beeping, I need to run some diagnostics or get it online to copy data off if its failling
[23:55] <histo> ESphynx: try a different desktop environment
[23:56] <kryl> hi, what about backup ntfs partition (with win vista) I used dd to backup & restore like normal. And don't touch the master boot record. But for the second time when I boot after restoring this partition win stay locked on the logo. Any advices please ? What am I doing wrong ?
[23:56] <histo> !phone | mattwj2002
[23:56] <ubottu> mattwj2002: Ubuntu for phone has been announced, see http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone to find out more and to sign up for progress updates. Discussion is in #ubuntu-phone
[23:56] <mattwj2002> thanks histo
[23:56] <mattwj2002> :d
[23:56] <Frozenthia> Anyway,when I install Nvidia-Current, and reboot, a "Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)" error comes up.
[23:57] <ESphynx> histo: Is there an easy way to switch? I don't care much for Unity.
[23:57] <millennia> ESphynx | xubuntu is good
[23:57] <ESphynx> millennia: i don't want to reinstall
[23:57] <histo> ESphynx: sure you can sudo apt-get install xfce   or kde or lxde or whatever DE you want to run.  Or you can install the meta packages like xubuntu-desktop lubuntu-desktop  etc...
[23:58] <millennia> ESphynx | all you have to do is replace unity with xfce and it's xubuntu :)
[23:58] <gmachine_24> Hi. I am wiping a laptop hd to reinstall Windows Vista (I am selling the computer) - there is an easy way, I believe, to overwrite the grub boot files etc. otherwise I end up dd'ing the entire drive.
[23:58] <histo> ESphynx: You don't need to reinstall to get xubuntu. Just sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop    and at the login screen click the ubuntu logo by your name to change the default session.
[23:58] <ESphynx> can I install cinnamon?
[23:58] <ESphynx> cinnamon is decent.
[23:59] <gmachine_24> Sorry, I am booting from a Ubuntu flash drive with 12.04 LTS live install
[23:59] <gmachine_24> ....... eegads...... flash drive as in USB drive
[23:59] <histo> gmachine_24: yeah dd is your safest bet. Something like dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M
[23:59] <histo> gmachine_24: assuming /dev/sda is the drive you want ot wipe
[23:59] <gmachine_24> histo yeah that's what I typically do ......... otherwise grub remains. Just looking for a shortcut
[23:59] <millennia> ESphynx | cinnamon is a forbidden topic
[00:00] <Frozenthia> : (
[00:00] <SalMi> Any hackers here ?! :/
[00:00] <histo> gmachine_24: Grub doesn't remain if you install windows.  It installs it's bootloader to the mbr
[00:00] <gmachine_24> histo, not in my experience.
[00:00] <ESphynx> millennia: lolz
[00:00] <gmachine_24> histo, Grub remains.
[00:00] <SalMi> HELLLLO
[00:00] <Frozenthia> Is Kubuntu a forbidden topic? I need help. : S
[00:00] <histo> gmachine_24: sure in windows fdisk /mbr   would write it's bootloader.  Or whatever they are using now. fixmbr I think
[00:00] <SalMi> ;D
[00:00] <sevensixtwo> SalMi, do you expect people to raise their hand?
[00:00] <ESphynx> It's installing :P
[00:01] <histo> gmachine_24: fixmbr c:   from a windows cd will overwrite it.
[00:01] <SalMi> just messing around duude :P\
[00:01] <SalMi> hmmm
[00:01] <histo> gmachine_24: However I would write zero's to the drive. People like me could recover your old files even after you loaded windows if you don't
[00:01] <Frozenthia> Well, thanks for the help. >_>
[00:01] <gmachine_24> SalMi this is not 4chan. Do you have an Ubuntu question or problem?
[00:02] <SalMi> Yah
[00:02] <gmachine_24> histo, yes, I know. I overwrite all drives. Just trying something new.

[00:06] <ESphynx> w0rm-_x: Unity? it's the worst
[00:06] <w0rm-_x> ESphynx, compiz
[00:07] <ESphynx> well compiz was OK until Unity came along :P
[00:08] <SalMi> I think unity is a gr8 interface :P
[00:08] <w0rm-_x> ESphynx, I don't know if the existence of both would create a conflict, only started to have problems when setting Compiz up..
[00:09] <ESphynx> w0rm-_x: hmm compiz normally comes with ubuntu/unity does it not?
[00:09] <w0rm-_x> ESphynx, no
[00:09] <ESphynx> It does for me?
[00:09] <SalMi> well its not buggy here .. I have an i5 intel quad core processor, 8 gb ram and Radeon 6570
[00:09] <SalMi> Works gr8 for me .. not buggy at all
[00:09] <w0rm-_x> ESphynx, that's weird
[00:09] <w0rm-_x> SalMi, which one?
[00:10] <SalMi> Wht do u mean which one ? :P Unity .. sorry for my english :/

[00:13] <histo> sam555: where are you trying to change this password?
[00:14] <_lucas_br_> w0rm-_x I need to configure the keyboard for these symbols work, and I can not.
[00:14] <histo> _lucas_br_: can you use alt codes?

[00:15] <histo> _lucas_br_: under keyboard > layout > layout options > compose key   I believe is what you are looking for
[00:15] <ESphynx> ok xubuntu just isn't working
[00:15] <ESphynx> I get this same red backgrond as with unity :S with no dock or anything
[00:16] <ESphynx> still looks like compilz/unity is running :|
[00:16] <w0rm-_x> histo, I don't want something different, just something that is better and has less problems.
[00:16] <sam555> histo: I'm trying to change the password from within the user account.  How would I do it from root?
[00:16] <histo> w0rm-_x: What sort of problems are you having?
[00:16] <blbrown_win3> With ubuntu12.10 when the top window bar is hidden from view, how can I move the window (say with gimp)
[00:16] <Seven_Six_Two> ESphynx, can you open a terminal and type     metacity --replace &
[00:16] <gmachine_24> sam555, http://www.ehow.com/how_5938222_change-password-ubuntu.html
[00:16] <histo> sam555: Change who's passwd?
[00:17] <histo> sam555: you could passwd sam555    in a terminal if sam555 is your username
[00:17] <histo> sam555: if you are logged in as that user just passwd
[00:17] <sam555> histo: I'm changing another admin within the OS.
[00:17] <blbrown_win3> nevermind I went to single window mode
[00:17] <_lucas_br_> histo: Ok
[00:17] <histo> sam555: sudo passwd otherusername
[00:17] <sam555> histo: i used that command, however, it would not let me change it because it was too similar, but I need to make it this particular password.
[00:17] <ESphynx> Seven_Six_Two I couldnt open anything, but in the console I could start xfce...
[00:18] <histo> sam555: can you please pastebin the error you are receiving
[00:18] <w0rm-_x> histo, I keep getting messages stating that there was a problem with the system and keep reporting them without a respond, also Ubuntu gets stuck when shutting it down while the other OSs does not
[00:18] <ESphynx> Where can I configure to run an xfce session instead?
[00:18] <sam555> it worked histo!!!
[00:18] <barrett> gmachine_24, sorry, i'm frustrated because usually its packed in here and my raid array... is not assembling, and i'm panicking and nobody seems to have any advice
[00:18] <histo> sam555: I don't know where you were thinking it was too similiar that should not be an issue
[00:19] <sam555> histo: thanks much.  It was the sudo passwd otherusername that worked
[00:19] <sam555> histo: when I did just passwd, it would give me that error
[00:19] <sam555> thanks for the save
[00:19] <histo> sam555: What error? I've never seen that.
[00:19] <ESphynx> well metacity looks like a nice WM
[00:19] <sam555> histo: it was saying "password too similar"

[00:33] <genoobie> hey all
[00:33] <genoobie> looking for a stripped down distro that runs lightweight for a PIII 800MHz, and 384MB ram (laptop)
[00:33] <apos> xubuntu
[00:33] <shufflebot> Ben64: sudo -i dude ;p
[00:33] <genoobie> apos, xubuntu is a bit laggy...
[00:34] <apos> because you have 384 ram.
[00:34] <KI4RO> Is there a way to tell the software center onto which drive to install software?
[00:34] <Ben64> shufflebot: but then you used su
[00:34] <genoobie> right, but I was thinking just plain old, twm and a simplified de
[00:34] <histo> Pici: in his example puppet is x for user puppet
[00:34] <Pici> histo: but git is in the puppet group.
[00:34] <genoobie> I am running puppylinux and I'm not entirely unhappy with it
[00:34] <apos> your going to have to either use a very old distro from that era, or add a lil more ram
[00:35] <histo> Pici: ahh
[00:35] <genoobie> so apos if I bumped it up to 512MB (max) xubuntu might work nicely?
[00:35] <histo> shufflebot: puppet folder is only x for the user not the g
[00:35] <Ben64> genoobie: you could try lubuntu too
[00:36] <Ben64> not sure which is lighter
[00:36] <genoobie> ben64, I did but the video detect was borked....
[00:36] <genoobie> lubuntu
[00:36] <apos> genoobie,  yes. also it would be a good idea to adjust the "swappiness" so it wont use swap untill it absolutely has to
[00:36] <shufflebot> Ben64: yeah because I'm switching users
[00:36] <apos> lubuntu has more artwork
[00:36] <genoobie> apos more artwork than xubuntu?
[00:36] <apos> yes
[00:37] <genoobie> hmm...I have lubuntu installed on another laptop and it seems reasonable
[00:37] <genoobie> but that laptop is a dual core 1gb
[00:37] <genoobie> anyhow, apos, lubuntu, xubuntu anything more streamlined DE?
[00:37] <histo> Ben64: su = switch user
[00:37] <Ben64> histo: i know...
[00:38] <genoobie> okay, so suppose I go with lubuntu, I have a *nix that has some drivers
[00:38] <apos> no dm and just run in terminal?
[00:38] <apos> lubuntu is fine. just adjust the swapiness
[00:38] <genoobie> should I get a printout of vendors (lspci) before I install lubuntu so the drivers work ok?
[00:39] <apos> if xubuntu works, im sure lubuntu will work
[00:39] <genoobie> yeah, xubuntu didn't quite work b/c of b43 legacy driver for wireless

[00:48] <unsobill> plz hurry guys :(
[00:48] <apos> use gksudo instead?
[00:49] <unsobill_> gksudo for what ?
[00:49] <histo> unsobill: I don't think you want to change your default telnet app. To do so you would update-alternatives --config telnet
[00:50] <histo> unsobill_: ^^ Although this doesn't sound like your issue
[00:50] <unsobill_> its basically a web form thats calling this command : telnet://xxx.xxx.xxx.xx:2000

[00:53] <unsobill_> ben telnet works
[00:53] <unsobill_> trying firefox

[00:53] <ubottu> unsobill_  This would help.: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."

[00:53] <unsobill_> ubuntu
[00:54] <unsobill_> nothing - same result on firefox as chrome
[00:54] <unsobill_> terminal window not being activated
[00:54] <unsobill_> arfgh
[00:54] <unsobill_> i can open terminal and easily telnet but command from browser doesnt work
[00:54] <histo> unsobill_: What webform?
[00:54] <unsobill_> u want tv ?
[00:55] <unsobill_> its basically lab farm
[00:55] <unsobill_> that has lots of devices to telnet to
[00:55] <unsobill_> u pick one - click open console to it and voila - terminal opens up with telnet connection to it
[00:55] <unsobill_> thats how it is on windows :(
[00:55] <histo> unsobill_: yeah with internet explorer maybe
[00:55] <unsobill_> nah with firefox and chrome
[00:56] <unsobill_> i suspect i has to do with this command :
[00:56] <unsobill_> telnet://xxx.xxx.xxx:xxx
[00:56] <unsobill_> basically ubuntu has no idea what to do with association "telnet://"
[00:56] <unsobill_> tghats my uneducated guess
[00:56] <histo> unsobill_: It's not that ubuntu doesn't but the browsers don't
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> unsobill, correction: the browsers don't know the connection.
[00:57] <unsobill_> should browser ask OS about associations then...
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> unsobill, ubuntu doesn't dictate a browser's interpretation of URL prefixes (telnet://, IRC:// etc.(
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> at least not afaikl
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> file associations, maybe.  prefix associations, don't think so.
[00:58] <unsobill_> awesome then i need to manually use my gnome connection manager to manually telnet to 30 devices
[00:58] <histo> unsobill_: Have you thought about installing an extension in chrome or firefox?
[00:58] <unsobill_> hmm
[00:58] <unsobill_> perhaps may work
[00:58] <histo> unsobill_: here's one froma  quick google search http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Google-Chrome-Extensions/Telnet-77530.shtml  Althought I would just look int he play store.
[00:59] <histo> unsobill_: also you could add hostnames for each ip.. Then just telnet whateverhostname   in a terminal
[00:59] <unsobill_> i guess i just use terminal manager if nothing else would work fine
[01:00] <unsobill_> no time for drilling
[01:00] <histo> unsobill_: I would look for an extension.
[01:00] <unsobill_> im on ubuntu - no luxury of simplicity :D
[01:00] <histo> unsobill_: would take less than a few minutes.
[01:00] <unsobill_> i installed it

[01:15] <histo> kitten_mittens: ahh they changed that in 12.10 select advanced options
[01:16] <kitten_mittens> and my grub is version 2.00-7ubuntu11
[01:16] <Guest80061> When I right click on it from the home folder and click mount I get an error message "unable to mount volume"
[01:16] <ElixirVitae> I was wondering whether setting up a new system from minimal CD and adding packages or deleting certain packages from a normal install have difference.
[01:16] <ElixirVitae> Does it?
[01:16] <histo> kitten_mittens: under advanced options you should be able to select an older kernel version
[01:16] <histo> ElixirVitae: yes gets rid of a lot of bloat
[01:17] <kitten_mittens> ok, theres versions 3.5.0-22 and 3.5.0-17 and both have a recovery option too
[01:17] <histo> ElixirVitae: you can completely customize what's installed
[01:17] <histo> kitten_mittens: slect 3.5.0-17  non-recovery
[01:17] <histo> kitten_mittens: see if the system boots without errors
[01:18] <kitten_mittens> it froze
[01:18] <ElixirVitae> Can't I get rid of the said bloat after install by hunting them down via synaptic?
[01:18] <kitten_mittens> it says loading linux 3.5.0-17-generic... then under it says loading initial ramdisk ... and its frozen
[01:19] <ElixirVitae> I meant normal install, btw.
[01:19] <histo> ElixirVitae: Yeah I guess just a longer way of doing it.
[01:20] <histo> ElixirVitae: like if you are going to just install ubuntu-desktop from a minimal install then there is no difference.
[01:20] <ElixirVitae> I wonder whether they will be more or less equivalent.
[01:20] <histo> ElixirVitae: if you are going to start with a cli system and work up then there would be. I'm sure you'd miss a bunch of stuff going backwards.
[01:20] <ElixirVitae> I sure won't install ubuntu-desktop :)
[01:21] <histo> ElixirVitae: Like what are you trying to accomplish in total?
[01:21] <ElixirVitae> Another question, do configs change between 32 and 64 bit systems?
[01:22] <histo> ElixirVitae: no
[01:22] <ElixirVitae> I want to get a leaner system, and learn more in the process, but wonder whether the hassle would be worth it.
[01:22] <ElixirVitae> If it doesn't give me much benefit, I'd rather install normal and delete some parts.

[01:23] <histo> ElixirVitae: You could always create a virtual machine and install a minimals system and work up.. Ex: install xorg  then whatever de you wanted.  You don't have to use a login manager for instance or you can pick a lighter one.
[01:23] <histo> kitten_mittens: what did it still lock up?
[01:23] <kitten_mittens> it says loading linux 3.5.0-17-generic... then under it says loading initial ramdisk ... and its frozen
[01:23] <histo> kitten_mittens: okay time to try recovery mode
[01:23] <ElixirVitae> Great, I should test it in VM, that way I can check whether my configs carry over seamlessly as well.

[01:27] <histo> kitten_mittens: I wouldn't rule it out. Since you are experiencing these wierd issues.  But you need to try booting to recovery mode.  It should dump you at a terminal.  Then we can see if all the updates installed properly.

[01:30] <histo> JokesOnYou77: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/42365/how-do-i-background-an-ssh-session/42367#42367
[01:30] <histo> JokesOnYou77: although you still should checkout screen much more powerfull.
[01:30] <Ben64> yes, screen
[01:31] <JokesOnYou77> histo, thanks.  Yeah, my solution didn't quite seem to work, I could get the ssh session back just with fg but then something funky happened with the prompt
[01:32] <JokesOnYou77> And yes, I realize that screen is generally better but I'm using my GUI atm, and I don't like multiple gui terminal windows running AND screen
[01:32] <histo> JokesOnYou77: when you bring it back hit enter for the screen to redraw. But ~ then ctrl+z works here for me
[01:32] <kitten_mittens> histo im in the recovery menu, now what
[01:32] <histo> JokesOnYou77: What I use is screen on the remote machine.   So I can disconnect the ssh session. Then if I want to come back I just ssh back in and reattach the screen starting where I left off.
[01:33] <histo> kitten_mittens: No under Advanced options for Ubuntu boot one of the (reocover mode) kernels
[01:34] <unsobill> OH GOD FINALLY
[01:34] <unsobill> PUTTY SAVED ME
[01:34] <FloodBot1> unsobill: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[01:34] <kitten_mittens> histo i did, it have me a recovery menu
[01:34] <unsobill> spent 1 hour trying to get firefox to associate telnet or ssh links under ubuntu
[01:34] <unsobill> fuking hell
[01:34] <unsobill> putty FTW
[01:34] <JokesOnYou77> histo, ahhh yes, I see what you mean.  I'm actually starting an ssh session with a dynamically forwarded port to the remot host so I can use it as a SOCKS proxy from browsing on my local host.  I don't have anything to really DO on the remote machine, I just need the tunnel open
[01:35] <histo> JokesOnYou77: then use -N so you don't get a prompt
[01:35] <histo> kitten_mittens: what are your options?
[01:36] <kitten_mittens> resume normal boot, clean, dpkg, grub, network, root, system summery
[01:36] <kitten_mittens> im guessing root? it says drop to root shell promt
[01:36] <JokesOnYou77> histo, perfect! ty :)
[01:36] <histo> kitten_mittens: How is this computer connected to network?
[01:36] <kitten_mittens> wireless
[01:37] <histo> kitten_mittens: is there a netroot option?
[01:37] <JokesOnYou77> histo, w8, but that doesn't give me back my local prompt :/
[01:37] <ekristen> are their any web based repo management tools?
[01:37] <kitten_mittens> no
[01:37] <ekristen> also is there any way to run a repo mirror but be able to approve/disapprove packages before allowing servers to download them?
[01:37] <histo> kitten_mittens: what's under network?  Can you configure your network card. And then drop to root shell that would be the goal here. Sorry it's been awhile since i've been in there.

[01:38] <ekristen> I'm looking to run several ubuntu servers internally in a production env, and want to control which packages get advertised for update

[01:41] <kitten_mittens> i just have a flashing underscore
[01:41] <GoGetOperated> ./Go~Get\.
[01:41] <histo> kitten_mittens: Do you still have a cd lying around that you can boot to?  It would be a lot easier than walking you through configuring a network in command line if you just booted that and we repaired from there.
[01:41] <kitten_mittens> ok, i dont have cd i have usb for my pc
[01:42] <histo> kitten_mittens: or usb. I can't remember what you staid you installed from?
[01:42] <kitten_mittens> because it has no cdrom
[01:42] <histo> kitten_mittens: yeah boot to the usb drive you installed from.
[01:42] <Brewski> I'm looking for a QR barcode scanner solution for Ubuntu. We're looking to scan QR codes into a web form instead of manually typing them, so a "keyboard wedge" would be preferred (like credit card readers).
[01:42] <GoGetOperated> What ar you trying to do
[01:42] <Brewski> I know the software is there, is there hardware compatibility for any USB scanners yet?
[01:42] <kitten_mittens> done histo
[01:43] <GoGetOperated> There is a thing called Google look for ith there
[01:43] <histo> kitten_mittens: I have to go but basically you are going to try. Booting from usb.  Setup your network so it gets online. Mount the hard drive where ubuntu is installed.  chroot /dev/sdx replace sdx with whatever your hdd is.  Then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.

[01:45] <kitten_mittens> OMFG THIS IS STUPID
[01:45] <histo> kitten_mittens: I really recomend doing a memtest.  Or I suspect your original iso you downloaded was corrupt.
[01:45] <NewUbun> yesterday i installed openproject from sourceforge but it is not workin.. I tried again today and got this msg

[01:56] <cainus> jrib: it only makes sense relative to my cwd... should I just give absolute paths?
[01:56] <jrib> cainus: you can use absolute paths if you want, yes
[01:57] <kitten_mittens> i feel as if im asking a pretty simple question
[01:57] <cainus> jrib: ahhh okay... so what does it do with the path?  writes it into the symbolic link?
[01:57] <cainus> jrib: so my relative paths wouldn't wortk
[01:57] <Guest33132> any help?
[01:58] <jrib> cainus: you can use relative paths, but they have to be relative to /etc/logrotate.d/couchdb, not your cwd
