<s> more ... configurable </s>
<s> how fast was that ? </s>
<s> faster than dban </s>
<s> dban often does n't put the drive into dma and stuff </s>
<s> <user> , DIR/etc/ is for configurations , not apache installs </s>

<s> <unk#a> : so , as i understand you , it does n't matter if the apache2 directory is on the system path , yes ? </s>
