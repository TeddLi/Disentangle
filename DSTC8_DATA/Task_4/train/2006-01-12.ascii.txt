[11:34] <CodenameKT> Mabus06: then logic permits us to think that maybe the people making these images know that u have a 700mb disk and made it accordingly. I don't believe u will have a problem burning. I don't know the CDI format so It could be a couple mb is bloat and won't even be burned to the cd

[11:40] <kameron> Berg: fdisk is a part of DOS, you can wipe our partitions and do all sorts of things with it, if you boot to it on a floppy or cdrom. or you can use partition magic, a product from Symantec i think, and run it from windows.
[11:40] <inventor_> 'unable to find group ubuntu' among other errors..

[00:17] <iKernel> Hi there. When running a game as a normal user, when the sound intializes, I get the following error: /dev/dsp: Device or resource busy Could not open /dev/dsp
[00:17] <Seveas> Sapentis, Breezy+some backports I made

=== kameron [n=kameron@S0106000129f5b884.cc.shawcable.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[00:17] <lucasvo> what is a backport?
[00:17] <iKernel> Other than that, the game runs fine. However, when running the game as root, the sound works. What could be wrong?
[00:17] <iKernel> lucasvo: www.google.com define: backport
[00:18] <cornflake> personally, i just want the latest stable packages
[00:18] <kameron> lucasvo: bakcporting is taking some things from dapper and porting them to breezy
[00:18] <cornflake> !soundserver
[00:18] <ubotu> parse error: dunno what the heck you're talking about, cornflake
[00:18] <lucasvo> kameron: aha
[00:18] <_null> how can I remove all packages which I installed from a custom repo?
[00:18] <cornflake> !esd
[00:18] <meshe> run game as root *shiver*
[00:18] <dutch> iKernal..make sure nothing else is trying to use the sound card....
[00:18] <Seveas> lucasvo, a backport in this case is a dapper package compiled on breezy
[00:18] <lucasvo> iKernel: you need to add the user to the audio group or something like this :D
=== corresponder [n=poeses_c@p54AD587B.dip.t-dialin.net]  has joined #ubuntu

[00:19] <Pygi> do not use backports if you don't know what you are doin'
[00:19] <iKernel> lucasvo: I hadn't thought of that. But you see, audio DOES play as a general rule, but I will try...
[00:19] <Seveas> lucasvo, tex, gnome-bluetooth, ntfsprogs (write support!)
=== Entity [n=entity@optimized.org]  has joined #ubuntu

[00:20] <iKernel> lucasvo: Not too sure...
[00:21] <lucasvo> iKernel: /dev/dsp is the hardware
[00:21] <lucasvo> gnome for e.g. is using ESD which runs under root
[00:21] <lucasvo> so it may use the hardware
[00:21] <lucasvo> afaik
[00:21] <lucasvo> Seveas: why do you need ntfs?
[00:21] <iKernel> lucasvo: So I should try adding my user to the esd group?
[00:22] <lucasvo> iKernel: I am not sure about that, it is some other group

[00:23] <iKernel> Seveas: I heard that microsoft made some changes to the ntfs file system that makes it so that your ntfs security becomes courrputed if you write to ntfs under linux.
[00:23] <lucasvo> woodgrain: what searchpath?
[00:24] <Kovecses> lucasvo, been like that ever since 4.10
[00:24] <lucasvo> Kovecses: aha

[00:44] <kameron> jean: TOWARDS
[00:44] <mwe> erUSUL: it will replace something in a string but to replace something in a file you need sed -i
[00:44] <ilba7r> oKtosiTe, thanx for the hint
[00:44] <ULffuntu> erUSUL: yeah, what happened was my mp3s switched partitions
[00:44] <jean> air goes to heatsink
[00:45] <oKtosiTe> ilba7r: ;-)
[00:45] <kameron> jean, yes
[00:45] <Inf3ctedFx> hey guys question: if I want to connect remotly to annother ubuntu box using ssh just typing ssh blabla@ip.com?
[00:45] <ULffuntu> erUSUL: so Z:/ goes to G:/
[00:45] <mwe> ULffuntu: use sed -i or it wont do what you want I think
[00:45] <theine> made, please post your /etc/apt/sources.list to #flood

[00:45] <ilba7r> D1, i have a 1gb here do not see any difference but i run light weight wm and do not have mem intensive appl
[00:45] <gnomefreak> isnt it ssh -x
[00:45] <Inf3ctedFx> I mean the IP address kameron
[00:45] <kameron> inf3ctedfx: yeah
[00:45] <Inf3ctedFx> just the ip withount .com
[00:45] <gnomefreak> ssh -X
[00:46] <crimsun> gnomefreak: only if you want to tunnel the remote [gui]  application
[00:46] <jean> how does a heat sink work then
[00:46] <jean> nickrud: this isnt even for a cpu...its a watercooler
[00:46] <spacey_ki> Inf3ctedFx, either the hostname OR the IP address
[00:46] <gnomefreak> X lags big time under ssh
[00:46] <Inf3ctedFx> oks how about on the GUI enviroment? can I use the Terminal Server Client?

[00:46] <crimsun> gnomefreak: you should be using vnc tunneled through ssh, then.
[00:46] <woodgrain> kameron, should I edit my .bashrc or my etc/profile to get more paths included in PATH?
[00:46] <kameron> jean: a heatsink is made of a heat conductive material that draws heat away from a device (cpu, etc). blowing on that with a fan helps disappate heat.
[00:46] <nickrud> jean, then, read your instructions, except: think where will the heat go, and the fastest.

[00:47] <jean> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heatsink
[00:47] <kameron> eh, i do .bash_profile crimsun
[00:47] <theine> woodgrain, better edit ~/.gnomerc and modify your path there (if you're using gnome that is...)
[00:47] <crimsun> kameron: ~/.bash_profile isn't sourced for non-login shells
[00:47] <woodgrain> crimsun, but would emacsing up my etc/profile isn't smart?  Why?
[00:47] <kameron> crimsun: what?
[00:47] <mwe> kameron: that will only work for login shells
[00:48] <nickrud> lol, /etc/bashrc for everyone, .bashrc for you, and .gnomerc for you in gnome
[00:48] <Thunderguy> I was playing my media player xmms, then all of a sudden it locked up so I killed it with the gnome-kill app, and the process wouldn't die on me so I kept killing the process until it was gone, afterwards upon restarting it still won't play saying that it is unable to output to my audio, my audio output is set to Alsa, after some fiddling around X locked up so I restarted it with ctrl-alt-backspace upon reloading the GDM login screen was
[00:48] <kameron> mwe, crimsun, what's a non login shell, what do you mean?
[00:48] <crimsun> woodgrain: because it's not a good idea to muck with system conffiles unless necessary.
[00:48] <woodgrain> theine,  I'm in bash though, through gnome, but still bash ... does gnomerc do the smae thign?
[00:48] <Pygi> !patience
[00:48] <ubotu> There are a lot of questions, but only few who might answer you. Please be patient.
[00:48] <_null> how can I remove all packages which I installed from a custom repo?
[00:48] <woodgrain> crimsun,  yeah, i appreciate that logic, thx.
[00:48] <mwe> kameron: .bashrc is sourced from .bash_profile by default making sure it's read in either case
[00:48] <made> what is #flood    .. I'm new to irc as well..

[00:48] <jader_> can somebody tell me if the default ubuntu installation comes with and cd/dvd burner??
[00:49] <gnomefreak> later all
[00:49] <kameron> made: so it doesn't clog up other channels, like this one
[00:49] <kameron> jader_: it does
[00:49] <Seveas> jader_, nautilus can burn to cd, so yes
[00:49] <kameron> gnomefreak: lates
[00:49] <theine> woodgrain, yes, the difference is that if you don't set your path in ~/.gnomerc, the Gnome environment is not aware of it
[00:49] <made> ok

[00:50] <spacey_ki> Inf3ctedFx, not the same one as windows, but you can use FreeNX

[00:50] <Inf3ctedFx> FreeNX?

[00:51] <theine> woodgrain, export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/bin
[00:52] <theine> woodgrain, that's handy
[00:52] <woodgrain> nickrud, what's gnome-terminal is it a real schell?
[00:52] <lucasvo> corypho: ask a intelligent question... what's the problem
[00:52] <mwe> kameron: by default, I believe so
[00:52] <zorak> anyone know of a way to increase your mouse's scroll whell speed?
[00:52] <mwe> kameron: you can change resources and shorcuts to change it though
[00:52] <kameron> zorak: if you're in gnome, open gnome-control-center
[00:52] <woodgrain> theine, that adds /bin to both path and home?
[00:52] <kameron> mwe: that's strange, because i've _always_ edited .bash_profile to change my path, and never ever had it not read by gnome-terminal or konsole, etc.

[00:53] <zorak> thanks kameron

[00:53] <woodgrain> theine,  if I'm going to write some binaries, should I put them in /home/user/bin or in a more systemwide place?
[00:53] <kameron> woodgrain: you've synched your palm to the bottom of a river, but what about to linux?
[00:54] <nickrud> woodgrain, it's not obvious, but it's simple. the best thing I could suggest is setting variables in /etc/profile, /etc/bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, and ~/.bashrc, and try logging into virtual consoles and gnome-terminals, and see what is recognized where.

[00:56] <theine> nickrud, please mention ~/.gnomerc on that wiki page...
[00:56] <ilba7r> kameron, you asked for a link for the .bashrc and bash_profile right
[00:56] <woodgrain> nickrud, theine  says it's best to put it in ~/bin --> no-one else uses these so why not?

[00:57] <nickrud> woodgrain, I have all my personal bash scripts in ~/bin

[00:57] <woodgrain> nickrud, what's the bias against ~/.gnomerc?
[00:57] <ilba7r> kameron, sorry i am using tab completionperhaps i made a mistake
[00:57] <kafeine> kameron, haven't said anything in this channel the whole week, i reckon
[00:57] <kameron> mwe: ill give it a try in a bit
[00:58] <kameron> ilba7r: oh, okay, i get it. i was confused
[00:58] <nickrud> woodgrain, no bias, it's just that .gnomerc can be abused.
[00:58] <woodgrain> nickrud, so ~/bin should be for my pers. shell scripts -- should I have a ~/etc for applications/
[00:58] <kameron> kafeine: haha! wow. that's strange. just a lot of reading hey.

[01:05] <Toma-> sorry, --darch
[01:05] <theine> Inf3ctedFx, just try to ssh to your friend's machine now
[01:05] <soundray> ryblo_f, are you using terminal software like minicom?
[01:06] <Inf3ctedFx> oks theine
[01:06] <Inf3ctedFx> let me c
[01:06] <Inf3ctedFx> its ok mwe
[01:06] <mwe> theine: ssh works without configuration?
[01:06] <theine> mwe, yes
[01:06] <ryblo_f> soundray, that, or just 'sudo echo AT > /dev/ttyS0'
[01:06] <mwe> theine: how can I ssh to a machine without a key pair?
[01:06] <Mr_Molez> can anyone work out why i cant get my cdrom drive working ?
[01:06] <nickrud> f1k0ym4k4, the 'console' is at alt-ctl-f1
[01:06] <ULffuntu> anybody here work alot with gedit & notepad.exe?
[01:06] <Thunderguy> I have a problem in linux with kernel memory curroption and need to reboot the kernel, but how can I do this while keeping some programs open and network connections open?
[01:06] <theine> mwe, using a password?

[01:07] <soundray> ryblo_f, of course you wouldn't see any output from the latter.
[01:07] <mwe> theine: just a password?
[01:07] <theine> mwe, sure
[01:07] <kameron> thunderguy: i don't think you can
[01:07] <nickrud> Thunderguy, I think you ask for the impossible :)\
[01:07] <ryblo_f> soundray, no, I understand... but even commands like ATDT do nothing you see
[01:07] <mwe> theine: that takes the "secure" part away from secure shell though

[01:07] <theine> mwe, no it doesn't
[01:07] <zorak> does anyone know of a setting for increasing mouse wheel scroll speed? the mouse preferences do not allow you to change it...
[01:07] <Toma-> woodgrain: ./configure --target=arm7-linux
[01:07] <Toma-> i think
[01:08] <Thunderguy> It might not be corruption though, what the problem is, /dev/dsp is locked by a program that no longer exists in cpu/memory space.
[01:08] <BearHunter> Is it safe to use the 'saved' option to use the savedefault setting instead of a number?
[01:08] <soundray> ryblo_f, how about in minicom? Silence, too?
[01:08] <theine> mwe, that's the standard way of using ssh, private
[01:08] <Thunderguy> So how do I unlock a device, that a non-existant program has locked?
[01:08] <ryblo_f> soundray, yes minicom, wvdial, even the GTK stuff, silence
[01:08] <kameron> zorak: hmm, i know the kde control center has that option, i assumed that gnome does too, but i don't really use gnome
[01:08] <mwe> theine: um I would say so, not using encryption keys breaks the basic idea of ssh
[01:08] <johanbr> Well, what do you know. The kernel I compiled a week ago just decided to start working. :) I installed a new ubuntu kernel in the meantime, so maybe the install procedure for that cast some initrd spells that made it all work.
[01:08] <kameron> thunderguy: like a program that's hanging?
[01:08] <theine> mwe, please educate yourself
[01:08] <Thunderguy> kameron: Yes, except it isn't hanging anymore, I made it stop hanging and die
