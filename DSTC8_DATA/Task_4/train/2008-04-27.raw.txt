[04:46] <unperson> Gman99999, The other comment is that I don't know if OSX keeps other metadata on files.  I think maybe it might, in which case I'm not sure if everything will work the same if you pull it off, wipe the drive, and put it back on.  Though I would certainly hope so.

[04:46] <deformation> @amenado i think ther are mentioned in the fstab
[04:46] <Gman99999> makgyver then why won't it mount a portable hard drive with the mac filesystem it knows and loves?
[04:46] <unperson> Gman99999, I'm sure there are mac experts out there that could give better answers to those questions.
[04:47] <deformation> how can i show you guys my fstab file?
[04:47] <JbsTac> I'm having trouble getting my PC5740 PC Card to work in Hardy. lsusb shows the card is detected, but Hardy fails to create the /dev/ttyACM0 file. Anyone know how I can get this working?
[04:47] <Pelo> pawan, check in totem there is a new plugin for that ,  just open the panel and check th drop down list at the top
[04:47] <amenado> deformation-> please man fstab so you have at least an understanding what those entries meant

[04:48] <hdevalence> Anyone tried using Debtorrent with Ubuntu?
[04:48] <brunner> ﻿is the AMD64 branch considered unstable or something?
[04:48] <mikebot> Does anyone know why when I right-click and press `re-index' on tracker, it just disappears?
[04:48] <brunner> ﻿my web host installed x86 on a quad Xeon system for some reason
[04:48]  * flyback is going to try to sleep, thx all
[04:48] <Sebboh> amenado, thanks for the knee-jerk manpage recommendation.  Actually, my linux system works fine.  I was suggesting that ##java can't help Ubuntu users install java.
[04:48] <amenado> Chris|-> did you remember paying for one? any indications like antennae input ports?
[04:48]  * Pelo sneaks up behind unperson and bangs a gong
[04:48] <Sebboh> see you guys
[04:48] <Pelo> flyback,  sleep well
[04:48] <timandtom> I have a .lexe file, but it won't open. Whats the command to make a file executable in terminal?
[04:48] <Chris|> amenado, i do have a tv ant, but not sure if i have a tv tuner
[04:48] <ubuntung-pinoy> amenado: Yes.. and it pings fine
[04:49] <Gman99999> makgyver well i dont know what my wife did she pressed this odd key combination to reboot the computer once it did, osx never booted up again, I booted the computer with the osx cd to run the disk utility but it coulddnt fix the hard drive, at all
[04:49] <unperson> Pelo, :-P
[04:49] <Pelo> timandtom, is this a windows executable files ? those don't run in linux unless you use wine
[04:49] <Makgyver> reset the PRAM
[04:49] <amenado> Chris|-> possibly not, if its just a monitor, receiver could be additional
[04:49] <Makgyver> what Mac is it?
[04:49] <timandtom> Pelo: Nope, lexe is Linux executable(Or so I was told last time I had this problem)
[04:49] <MEtaLpREs_> is there something wrong with the ubuntu irc server?  i keep getting disconnected and timing out, none of my other servers are having this problem
[04:50] <Gman99999> makgyver so then i took out the hard drive and put in another one, and then i put the hard drive i took out into the portable hard drive enclosure just to see if it worked at all, since i thought it was probably broken
[04:50] <amenado> ubuntung-pinoy-> then your configs for smtp may need reconfiguring
[04:50] <deformation> ok guys
[04:50] <Chris|> amenado, how would i know for sure?
[04:50] <deformation> here is it http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64632/
[04:50] <Orbixx> I'm having an issue with Ubuntu recently. Ubuntu appears to believe it receives or emulates an up arrow keypress every 5 seconds, without or without a keyboard plugged in, even with a fresh installation and a Live CD.
[04:50] <unperson> Makgyver, Gman99999, Heh, it seems like every mac solution begins with "reset the PRAM"
[04:50] <Jangari> is there a way to restart to a particular line of the menu.lst from a command line? Something using $ shutdown -r, perhaps?
[04:50] <gleaken> is there anyone who can help me with the synaptics touch pad issue
[04:50] <amenado> Chris|-> is this for an extra card? for a laptop? wht hardware do you have?
[04:50] <timandtom> Pelo: Either way, I know this file works :) Used it before, but I need to set it up again because I reinstalled 7.10
[04:50] <ubuntung-pinoy> amenado: if one is using default ports, does one need to append " :portnumber " to the server name?
[04:50] <Pelo> timandtom, sorry I just missread,    put it on the desktop,  open a terminal ,  cd Desktop,   sudo chmod +x  filename,  sudo ./filename
[04:50] <Makgyver> unperson, it is the best way to eliminate about 90% or all end user issues
[04:50] <gleaken> The trackpoint gets it's mouse buttons disabled but the track point still works
[04:50] <obf214> d
[04:51] <timandtom> Pelo: Ah, thankyamuch!
[04:51] <Chris|> amenado, i'd like to use tvtime, but not sure if i have the tuner, i want to watch tv on my computer
[04:51] <amenado> ubuntung-pinoy-> dont know what app you are using,
[04:51] <RoC_MasterMind> Jangari, if you want to change the default OS in grub, change it
[04:51] <Dr_willis> timandtom,  just 'chmod +x whatever' then to set it as being exexutable then run it with ./whatever
[04:51] <Gman99999> makgyver windows wouldnt read it or mount it nor would osx but ubuntu would and now im surprised and quite pleased that it works so far
[04:51] <tawt> what's the best app to use for Python?
[04:51] <stuart> hey guys, my update-manager is broken :(
[04:51] <pawan> hi
[04:51] <Chris|> amenado, i have a hp media pc
[04:51] <tawt> stuart, what's the problem?
[04:51] <Makgyver> Ubuntu will see it as a raw disk
[04:51] <amenado> Chris|-> what hardware do you have? a pci card? pcmia?
[04:51] <stuart> I get an error that says "importerror: cannot import name Widget from gtk"
[04:51] <unperson> Makgyver, Yeah, so it seems.  I don't really understand what the PRAM does, so it's just black magic to me.
[04:51] <timandtom> Dr_Willis: Thanks. Is there a way to make it so it STAYS executable?
[04:51] <deformation> @Pelo @amenado http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64632/
[04:51] <Jangari> RoC_MasterMind: it ain't that, i have it set up just how i want it, but i want to be able to restart in windows but not have to wait for the grub to load to switch over
[04:52] <Makgyver> if you plug in the HDD in Mac OS Xand go to Disk utility you will/should be able to see/repair it
[04:52] <Chris|> amenado, i dont know that, how would i find out?
[04:52] <gleaken> stuart: Are you using the main repositories?  if you are, you may want to change to a different one, if you need help, ask
[04:52] <Gman99999> makgyver I tried it again on osx and it won't read the hard drive, so is there anything i can do, should i pull the files i want off of the hard drive and then format it?
[04:52] <amenado> Chris|-> you proly have to dig that info from hp web site
[04:52] <Jangari> sadly still some programs for which i need windows
[04:52] <Pelo> RoC_MasterMind, gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst ,  in the first 20 lies, there is a line default = 0   that the number or hte entry to boot first,   the numering starts with 0 -1 - 2 -3 etc
[04:52] <ubuntung-pinoy> amenado: Evolution
[04:52] <Gman99999> makgyver is there some special magical way to do that or is a simple format from ubuntu going to work?
[04:52] <Chris|> alright amenado so i'd search for what exactly?
[04:52] <Pelo> deformation,  what  do you need to do again ?
[04:52] <][AcHm2][> for what no ip my eth0
[04:52] <tawt> what's the best app to use for Python?
[04:52] <Gman99999> makgyver or is there a way i can still salvage the hard drive?
[04:52] <Makgyver> Gman99999, pull the files and write the Disk to Zero, then put it in the Mac as format it in disk utility
[04:52] <][AcHm2][> i have install 8.04
[04:53] <Gman99999> makgyver ok
[04:53] <RoC_MasterMind> Jangari, maybe set windows as the default but when you want ubuntu select ubuntu, that way if you just reboot from within ubuntu it will go into windows by itself
[04:53] <Makgyver> I would try disk utility in Mac OS first
[04:53] <stuart> gleaken: it doesn't run at all. it says ""importerror: cannot import name Widget from gtk"
[04:53] <obf214> !mp3 -> obf214

[04:55] <stuart> Jangari: yes it is
[04:55] <tawt> stuart, i'm not familiar with that
[04:55] <RoC_MasterMind> Jangari, it's either sit and wait, or set a default.
[04:55] <amenado> deformation-> yes, ubuntu will natively mount ext3 File systems, for ntfs, you have to use ntfs-3g
[04:55] <stuart> tawt, k, now worries
[04:55] <deformation> @Pelo it does not show in Thunar

[05:02] <stuart> gleaken, which package am I looking for ? Is it just called python ?
[05:02] <deformation> @Pelo because of that i think its a matter of kitpolicy
[05:02] <manixtate> will do thanks aard
[05:02] <maco> MrLinux: what makes you think ubuntu's a boy?
[05:02] <Tweaker> Ok Im back, and I got a few questions about codecs. I cant play internet movies on my computer. [Exp: Youtube] How can I fix this?
[05:02] <gleaken> stuart: give me a second, I will walk through it on my end too.
[05:02] <xkcdr0ckz> nm, crdlb's another user.
[05:02] <crdlb> Pelo: almost no one needs Xgl anymore
[05:02] <TaRDy> is ubuntu really no longer going to support the SPARC processors?
[05:02] <stuart> gleaken, sweet, thanks :)
[05:02] <maco> Tweaker: install ubuntu-restricted-extras and youll get flash, java, normal codecs, etc
[05:02] <ChuckMac> RoC_MasterMind I'm on 7.10. Apt tells me I've got the current version of the update-manager and do-release-upgrade says there are no new versions.....
[05:02] <Tweaker> thanks, is it in sypnaptic
[05:02] <Pelo> deformation, I haven't had much experince with the new policy kit ,  you'll have to figure that one out yourself
[05:03] <Crshman> ok...if no one knows how to fix my issue.....where do i find logs for compiz so i can attempt to figure this out on my own?
[05:03] <samliu> !tardy
[05:03] <The_Ringmaster> anyone got sound to work on a lenovo y410?
[05:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about tardy - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[05:03] <maco> TaRDy: security updates from old versions will still happen, and itll be in the ports, but no official support on future releases
[05:03] <samliu> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3268995
[05:03] <evilbug> Pelo- i tried doing a clean install yesterday after the upgrade failed and messed up my system,and the clean install didn't work either.it gave me a bunch of errors and saying that the disc was corrupt.i had the disc checked after it was burnt + twice with the disc check in the boot menu and it came up fine.
[05:03] <samliu> I followed that
[05:03] <deformation> @pelo you're right :) Thanks anyway guys
[05:03] <evilbug> evilbug- any idea why?
[05:03] <Pelo> Crshman, restate your issue periodicaly, it's a busy channel and it's been a long day
[05:03] <timandtom> Pelo: Theres quite a few, any idea which one?
[05:03] <samliu> and got the wusb300n working in 2 minutes
[05:03] <Crshman> hi all, i'm running hardy and for some reason when i open firefox compiz.real shoots upto 100% cpu usage and kills my system....any ideas?
[05:03] <tokyoahead> guys can someone help me getting sound from my SoundMAX soundcard on my laptop? the external volume control works fine with the linux volume slider, but I cannot hear any sound...
[05:03] <deformation> Thanks @amenado
[05:03] <RoC_MasterMind> ChuckMac, gksu "update-manager -d"
[05:03] <samliu> so I highly recommend it
[05:03] <drivetrax> There is a channel #compiz-Fusion... they are very helpful
[05:03] <Tweaker> Thanks Im out
[05:04] <aardvarken> tokyoahead: is the correct device selected in the sound settings?
[05:04] <Crshman> Pelo: i believe it...i thank everyone here for all their help...i know new releases cause a lot of stress for everyone!
[05:04] <RoC_MasterMind> Crshman, try also asking that on #compiz-fusion
[05:04] <crdlb> xkcdr0ckz: if you use @ in front of my nick, I don't get a hilight
[05:04] <mouseclone> anyone have an update on the 2.6.24-12 kernel breaking sound?
[05:04] <amenado> deformation-> you're welcome
[05:04] <aardvarken> tokyoahead: for instance, my surround sound car can select front, back, etc.
[05:04] <mouseclone> Audigy card more so
[05:04] <samliu> btw tardy, its a draft n card so if you ever get an n router it works, plus its not that expensive
[05:04] <Crshman> RoC_MasterMind: Will do
[05:04] <maco> how do i use gfxboot?  the howto i found on the forums is from dapper and didn't work on the gfxboot theme i found
[05:04] <samliu> orinoco cards are great too but expensive
[05:04] <Pelo> timandtom,  you're looking for a library , so one that starts with lib and check for the version number I think it was 2
[05:04] <manixtate> screen flashed but no change
[05:04] <Qrawl_> the new Ubuntu is very nice
[05:04] <tokyoahead> aardvarken: I think so. I chose ALSA for all of them, Autodeteect would not let me hear the test-sound
[05:04] <TaRDy> maco thank you, I was under the impression ubuntu and sun had been working together to help support
[05:04] <ChuckMac> RoC_MasterMind, have done that several times with no success.
[05:04] <Nemes> I have a folder where SSH users are uploading files. Does anybody know how I could to be mailed every time a new file is uploaded or an existent one is modified? I don't even know where I could start searching
[05:04] <RoC_MasterMind> samliu, my orinoco was $20 on ebay!
[05:04] <ezzieyguywu1> what script is hardy using for suspend? i don't think its /etc/acpi/sleep.sh because it doesn't recognize any changes to /etc/default/acpi-support. I think i read somewhere that hardy would use pmutils for suspend?
[05:04] <xtknight> Qrawl_, i like it too, just some small perks
[05:04] <maco> TaRDy: sun now does x86_64 though
[05:04] <RoC_MasterMind> ChuckMac, that is sad, sorry to hear.
[05:04] <xkcdr0ckz> i know, i was responding to Pelo. hah.
[05:04] <maco> TaRDy: i think
[05:05] <Qrawl_> xtknight, like what
[05:05] <samliu> really?
[05:05] <ffm> Is there any reason that I would not want to have security updates install automatically for a home machine?
[05:05] <samliu> I was looking for an orinoco gold card classic
[05:05] <samliu> it was like
[05:05] <Pelo> evilbug, why didyou reinstall ? I don'T recall I though you were doig fine execpt for a few little issues
[05:05] <samliu> $150-200
[05:05] <FloodBot2> samliu: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[05:05] <RoC_MasterMind> ffm, no.
[05:05] <Vlet> ffm: no
[05:05] <gleaken> stuart: when you query (CTRL-F) for python in synaptics, you will see a LOT of stuff, we are looking for the entry that says just "python", it should be a wrapper package for python 2.4 or 2.5, BTW, I assume you are gutsy?
[05:05] <Pelo> xkcdr0ckz, I missed it
[05:05] <RoC_MasterMind> samliu, I said silver!
[05:05] <figuringout> i was trying to get fretsonfire(the guitar hero clone) working on my ubuntu 7.10. now I get this error "OSError: glut: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
[05:05] <ffm> Vlet and RoC_MasterMind , then why is that not the default?
[05:05] <ffm> Vlet and RoC_MasterMind , and it won't reboot w/o prompting, even so, right?
[05:05] <aardvarken> does anyone know why the esperanto support does nothing?
[05:06] <RoC_MasterMind> ffm, typically your machine shouldn't be doing things you haven't asked it to.
[05:06] <NIghtFire> anyone here installed the 8.04 upgrade yet ?
[05:06] <evilbug> Pelo- i was doing fine for a bit,but then i had too many errors at startup and apps wouldn't launch for some reason.but any clue to why the clean install wouldn't work?
[05:06] <Pelo> aardvarken, cause no one speaks iit anymore ?
[05:06] <aardvarken> lol Pelo
[05:06] <RoC_MasterMind> ffm, this isn't windows, attitudes are different, configure it that way if you want it.
[05:06] <maco> TaRDy: the sun servers i use at school dont say SPARC when i uname -a them, at least
[05:06] <stuart> gleaken: yep Gutsy. OK found it. 2.5.1
[05:06] <ffm> RoC_MasterMind, Ok. How about presenting the option during install, since that improves security.
[05:06] <stuart> gleaken: Mark for re-install ?
[05:06] <ffm> RoC_MasterMind, I realize that.
[05:06] <timandtom> Pelo: I get an error trying to load "libstdc++.so.5". In Synaptic, theres 5 that start with libstdc++5
[05:06] <Pelo> evilbug,  ok when you say clean install is there another os on this computer ?
[05:06] <ezzieyguywu1> ﻿what script is hardy using for suspend? i don't think its /etc/acpi/sleep.sh because it doesn't recognize any changes to /etc/default/acpi-support. I think i read somewhere that hardy would use pmutils for suspend?
[05:07] <xkcdr0ckz> @Pelo: after clicking on the Compiz tab in Appearance, i get "The Composite extension is not available". next step?
[05:07] <Pelo> timandtom,  sounds like a winneer
[05:07] <simtower> my ubuntu is broken after update
[05:07] <RoC_MasterMind> ffm, I don't want to see that as a default, but I think your idea is part of the forward-thinking Ubuntu needs.  There is an idea tracker on ubuntu's website.
[05:07] <crdlb> xkcdr0ckz: please join #compiz-fusion
[05:07] <Crshman> is there a way to _more_ forcefully kill a process than "sudo killall" ?
[05:07] <xkcdr0ckz> @Pelo: when clicking on Normal or Extra for Visual Effects.
[05:07] <Pelo> xkcdr0ckz, re-install the xserver-xgl package you remove earlier
[05:07] <ffm> RoC_MasterMind, Mindstorm?
[05:07] <RoC_MasterMind> Crshman, yes...killall -9
[05:07] <maco> ffm: ideastorm
[05:07] <evilbug> Pelo- win xp,but i don't see why it would conflict with hardy since gutsy installed just fine after.
[05:07] <patifa> crashanddie: -9 flag
[05:07] <maco> ffm: this isnt legos :P
[05:07] <gleaken> stuart: yes, but before you do, make sure that it is listed as installed, at the bare minimum, the "python" and "python2.5" packages
[05:07] <crdlb> Pelo: he doesn't need that in hardy
[05:07] <Pelo> Crshman,  if it is a gui app ,  xkill  and then click on it
[05:08] <Pelo> crdlb, ok you take care of it
[05:08] <crdlb> Pelo: composite is just disabled because gutsy's restricted drivers manager disabled it for him
[05:08] <x1250> timandtom: you have to install libstdc++5 package
[05:08] <Crshman> RoC_MasterMind: that worked thanks!
[05:08] <simtower> could any help to fix my ubuntu stuck at login?
[05:08] <timandtom> x1250: Thanks :)
[05:08] <Crshman> Pelo: thanks for the suggestion!
[05:08] <patifa> just don't sudo kill the wrong thing, system will crash if a certain few are killed
[05:08] <stuart> gleaken: yep they are. Here goes *click*
[05:08] <mouseclone> simtower: what up? password?
[05:08] <Pelo> evilbug,  does the live cd work for you ? do you hve any data from ubuntu you need to save  ?
[05:08] <gleaken> stuart: I have python-apport and python-apt also installed
[05:08] <TaRDy> maco, sun has many servers available and some are SPARC
[05:08] <timandtom> x1250: To be installed: gcc-3.3-base. That sound right?
[05:08] <simtower> mouseclone: i updated to 8.04 now x locks up after I login
[05:09] <gleaken> stuart: see if you have those as well, don't worry about a reinstall, it should be harmless, considering your current situation
[05:09] <RoC_MasterMind> Crshman, it's the difference between asking the process to exit and having the kernel terminate it and free it's memory
[05:09] <maco> TaRDy: oh. i thought perhaps they had discontinued SPARC and were going to do just 64bit now
[05:09] <ffm> macd, Brainstorm. We're both wrong.
[05:09] <TaRDy> thank you samliu for the info, I had seen that but it is a little more than i want to be spending
[05:09] <maco> anyone here have experience making gfxboot go?
[05:09] <mandje> booting the live-cd. can you add options using [esc]?
[05:09] <simtower> how can i have ubuntu stop the startup application
[05:09] <Crshman> RoC_MasterMind: got it! i'll keep that in mind last time!
[05:09] <maco> ffm: oh right, thats dell's :P
[05:09] <mouseclone> simtower: ctrl+atl+F1 and you can log in fine there?
[05:09] <gleaken> stuart: also python-brlapi and python-cairo, those you may not need but they are probably installed already
[05:09] <evilbug> Pelo- the live cd works flawlessly and no,i don't have anything to save since i just installed gutsy :)
[05:09] <simtower> yes mouseclone
[05:09] <ffm> maco, Then there's storm, canonical's database thingie.
[05:10] <Crshman> THANKS to all those in here that are helping everyone.....i'm sure you don't hear this too often so i'm just saying thanks on behalf of all the frustrated new users!
[05:10] <gleaken> stuart: if you are having problems downloading because of the slow servers, we can change your repositories to a faster set
[05:10] <Pelo> maco, you need to uninstall grub and install a grub-gfxpackage  , check in the forum there are instructions
[05:10] <mouseclone> simtower: video card?
[05:10] <maco> Pelo: i did that, but the forum instructions dont work
[05:10] <Pelo> maco,  actualy  orry, this should work instructions for installing on ubuntu.
[05:10] <simtower> it is a radeon mobile

[05:10] <Pelo> if those aren'T enough or you are not using ubuntu , check in the other gfxboot themes that are available here some of the others have instructions
[05:10] <FloodBot2> Pelo: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[05:10] <andylcp> :(
[05:10] <stuart> gleaken: ok, are they all included in the wrapper package ?
[05:10] <maco> Pelo: im guessing because theyr from dapper-time not now
[05:10] <gleaken> stuart: unfortunately, I don't think so
[05:10] <stuart> gleaken: yes that might be an idea. It hasn't even started downloading yet

[05:11] <ezzieyguywu1> does nobody know?
[05:11] <maco> Pelo: alright...
[05:11] <ffm> Crshman, Much appreciated.
[05:11] <gleaken> stuart: go to settings->repositories
[05:11] <patifa> Nemes: I don't think there's anything built-in to do that
[05:11] <stuart> gleaken: "The repository information has changed. You have to click on the "Reload" button for your changes to take effect"
[05:11] <gleaken> stuart: then, when that opens up, there is a "Download from:" entry, correct?
[05:11] <mandje> booting the live-cd. can you add options using [esc]?
[05:12] <gleaken> stuart: ok, did you select a better mirror?
[05:12] <mouseclone> simtower: so do you get anything to show up after login, or just a lock, or a crash?  and can you CTRL+ALT+Backspace?
[05:12] <Gman99999> unperson I just tried to mount the hard drive and i got this message sudo mount /dev/Macintosh HD /media/Macintosh HD

[05:12] <samliu> LSG: YES.
[05:12] <simtower> mouseclone it is orange background with gray box in the corner

[05:12] <MrGnu> Hi Pelo and Aaron.  I hope that someone could help me on this one.  Im in Hardy now and I want to attempt another install of Kubuntu (it failed last time in Gutsy when I did sudo apt-get install Kubuntu, I just have the working splash screen) can you advise what is my best course of action?
[05:12] <mouseclone> LSG: yes.. might be OpenGL
[05:12] <samliu> LSG, are you using nvidia drivers?
[05:12] <stuart> gleaken: I haven't got that far yet. I clicked 'reload' and it's reloading (slooowly)
[05:12] <simtower> mouseclone ctrl-alt-backspace works but it lcks up again if i login again
[05:12] <LSG> samliu: What the hell? No...ATI
[05:13] <Gman99999> unperson how do i get rid of that?
[05:13] <timandtom> Pelo x1250: Ah, shweet, everything works good now :) Thanks
[05:13] <samliu> oh well lucky then, nvidia drivers have been a b*tch
[05:13] <Pelo> MrGnu, I would wait a few days before doign that ,  the servers are very busy ,   and it is sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[05:13] <TaRDy> Gman99999, did you throw in a \ before the space?
[05:13] <bzwingzero> I installed the Hardy Heron beta about a week ago and everything was working but one of the updates since broke my sound. How can I fix it? (Running a dell vostro 1500 aka inspiron 1520)
[05:13] <LSG> mouseclone: They worked very smoothly 1 hour ago using Gutsy on this same computer...
[05:13] <evilbug> Pelo- thanks! also please give me the command again for the removal of desktop volumes.
[05:13] <samliu> if you look up nvidia-glx-new in launchpad, you get like a billion hardy bugs haha

[05:13] <mouseclone> samliu:  nVidia have worked fine but just get some ghost images from the OpenGL
[05:14] <evilbug> Pelo- and format the partition with ext3,correct?
[05:14] <samliu> is anyone else mad that they took out XMMS? I hate not having themes for audacious

[05:14] <mouseclone> LGS: yes I know I just got the install done about 1 hour ago
[05:14]  * Pelo made that
[05:14] <maco> Pelo: im trying renaming it to messag.ubuntu instead of its gnome-look name

[05:14] <gilad> i've just installed xubuntu on a media pc. my wireless card (WMP300N) can list me all networks, but I can't connect to mine (using WPA). it seems it does not accept the password
[05:14] <RoC_MasterMind> samliu, I'm sadden by the loss of XMMS.
[05:14] <simtower> is ubuntu 8.04 broken?
[05:14] <drivetrax> mdkitzman,  - what ati card?
[05:14] <TaRDy> Gman99999, try doing mount /dev/Macintosh\ HD
[05:14] <ezzieyguywu1> ﻿what script is hardy using for suspend? i don't think its /etc/acpi/sleep.sh because it doesn't recognize any changes to /etc/default/acpi-support. I think i read somewhere that hardy would use pmutils for suspend?
[05:14] <ffm> Hey, can someone tell me what the default for  updates is? Does it just download them automatically, or does it do _nothing_ by default?
[05:15] <patifa> simplexio: There are bugs...
[05:15] <ffm> !repeat | ezzieyguywu1
[05:15] <ubotu> ezzieyguywu1: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[05:15] <Pelo> maco,  the name means nothing , it was just so I wouldnt confuse it with the other ones I had when I made it
[05:15] <manixtate> alt f2 will not work for me argh
[05:15] <ffm> simplexio, Not broken, but some have issues.
[05:15] <LSG> mouseclone: Any idea if there's some fix or something? Whenever i open the trash can it takes like 3 seconds to fully open
[05:15] <RoC_MasterMind> samliu, adacious has a refugee theme that looks like XMMS but wastes space in the playlist.
[05:15] <maco> Pelo: im also afraid past use of startupmanager may have made things umm..bad
[05:15] <servlsuser> hey noob here just instaled hardy on a compaq desktop running a gig of ram amd 64 3500+ install goes fine hardy boots up gives me the login screen i put in my username my password it tries to log on then i get thrown back to the log on screen it isnt an invalid password it just resets
[05:15] <TaRDy> Gman99999, any directory paths should have a \ before a space in a directory name
[05:15] <ezzieyguywu1> its hard to believe that nobody knows this when suspend has been an issue since fiesty
[05:15] <mouseclone> simtower:  I am unsure of what to tell you... you could try reinstalling GDM and Gnome... but I don't know if it is your drivers or not...
[05:15] <patifa> nm simplexio, sorry about that, nevermind my name mentions
[05:15] <Gman99999> taRDy nope didnt work
[05:15] <Nemes> patifa, thanks anyway, I'll try to write some kind of script to do that

[05:15] <ffm> ezzieyguywu1, please try another venue.
[05:15] <maco> Pelo: oh ok.  gentoo's wiki on gfxboot said message. was the prefix so i thought it might matter
[05:16] <samliu> RoC: I was looking at that today and ended up downloading one of the 5 or 6 available themes from gnome-look
[05:16] <Tweaker> Ok, well that package didnt work, why is that?
[05:16] <TaRDy> Gman99999, sorry thats all i have to offer :-/
[05:16] <mouseclone> simtower:  I think that there is an Xorg config tool as well that you might try.  I cant remember
[05:16] <patifa> Nemes: Best bet is to use the logging facility of sftp-server
[05:16] <Pelo> maco,  the file can named anything
[05:16] <patifa> and work from there
[05:16] <samliu> I hope people get on it and start making more themes haha
[05:16] <evilbug> Pelo- and the command to remove the startup volume icons off my desktop? (i forgot it X_X)
[05:16] <simtower> maybe i will just reinstall from scratch mouseclone
[05:16] <ezzieyguywu1> i don't know what you mean by another venu, but i think i'll wait for someone who may have an answer
[05:16] <Gman99999> i still got the same error message, which is weird because i deleted that file just a few minutes ago
[05:16] <ezzieyguywu1> :-)

[05:41] <djdeep> hello, here german users ?

[05:41] <harushimo> my dvd rom isn't working
[05:41] <ezzieyguywu1> B166erx: i had that problem too. make sure the the check box is actually checked. what actually fixed it for me is i logged in through the "X-script" session (don't even know what that is) and at that point the box was not checked and it didn't say that it was running. then i simply checked it, rebooted, and everything was fine. make sense?
[05:41] <Pelo> Co2, yes it' a dock
[05:41] <B166erx> smallfoot- yeap, its 'Activated' but 'not used'    (weirdly) , also, it doenst want me to activate any compiz  effects

[05:50] <M1dn1ght> Hey guys - I've managed to get Ubuntu running from the live cd and was able to install by choosing "noapic" and "acpi=off" as well as booting into safe graphics mode.  Problem is, when I try to boot the newly installed OS, it is freezing in the same place the installer was (the ubuntu logo with the scroll bar).  Is there some way to transfer the options I set to install to my regular install?
[05:50] <alien> mouseclone: ^
[05:50] <Tweaker> Whoot ok I got it to play vids, but when I use pidgin thats when it Freezes I think
[05:50] <cky> Gman99999: You may need to run "apt-get --reinstall install sudo" or some such (I don't know the "official" way to reinstall a package, sorry).
[05:50] <M1dn1ght> Sorry about the length of that...
[05:50] <roachmmflhyr> mheath: apt-get install kernel-headers....package is not available
[05:50] <Co2> alien, what video card do you have?
[05:50] <mouseclone> anyone seen a danger in dropping back to 2.6.24-11 kernel?

[05:51] <alien> Co2: good to go
[05:51] <Gman99999> maco ok so how do i install it, how in the heck did i un-install it?  I just used it a few mintues ago before this crap started
[05:51] <maco> Gman99999: huh? it should just have lines explaining what the columns mean and then the last line says "ii" in the first column and then sudo (the name), then the version, then an explanation
[05:51] <Co2> ok so you have the driver installed?
[05:51] <alien> Co2: yes
[05:51] <Gman99999> maco Im going to pastebin it for you
[05:51] <alien> Co2: it was restricted or something
[05:51] <Co2> ok

[05:51] <alien> :P
[05:51] <simtower> maybe you should install from scratch too
[05:52] <erimar77> what's the install size of server edition
[05:52] <alien> Co2: so what now
[05:52] <cky> M1dn1ght: Then, edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add those options to ("kopt", I think?) and rerun update-grub.

I got two errors during the upgrade relating to network manager, which I foolishly didn't write down because the popup said installation would continue. The graphical upgrader has stopped at the end of the "Installating Upgrades" step, with the terminal saying simply "Errors were encountered during processing: network-manager (newline) network-manager-
[05:52] <maco> cky: boot would be the letter "b"
[05:52] <alien> Co2: let me see
[05:52] <Co2> that will put a compiz icon in sys tray
[05:52] <M1dn1ght> thanks cky - I tried that, so I am thinking perhaps it was this safe-graphics mode (which I got with f4 during install) that helped me here?
[05:52] <johnny_> anybody else get the issue with symlink to /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 failing and causing the upgrade to stop completely?
[05:52] <Tweaker> Why is it Pidgin freezes when I watch streaming video?
[05:52] <cky> maco: Yes, eventually have to hit "b", after editing the command line. :-P
[05:52] <juvi> jack
[05:52] <maco> Tanaric: it probably couldnt get the nm packages due to slow repos, just apt-get them
[05:52] <Gman99999> maco http://pastebin.com/d43b020c6
[05:52] <maco> cky: i meant to say that to midnight. sorry
[05:53] <alien> Co2: nothing liek that under apps :(
[05:53] <alien> Co2: gnome
[05:53] <Tanaric> maco: Sure, but the upgrade window is stuck -- it thinks it's still going but it's not. Is it safe to force-quit it and run apt?
[05:53] <maco> Gman99999: see the last line where it says "ii"? that means its installed
[05:53] <alien> Co2: but i looked in all spots
[05:53] <tokyoahead> guys my menus and email lists in Thunderbird are extremely small... firefox is OK though. how can I change it? in the preference is a display-tab with fonht sizes but that changes o0nly the email text, not the menus etc
[05:53] <alien> only
[05:53] <Co2> oh your using gnome
[05:53] <Gman99999> maco ok
[05:53] <alien> Co2: advanced desktop settings
[05:53] <cky> M1dn1ght: That is definitely possible.
[05:53] <Gman99999> maco so what to do now ? lol
[05:53] <alien> Co2: there is that for compiz config settings manager, but like i said whatever i enable i see no eye candy :P
[05:53] <M1dn1ght> Yes - I got to that point - I added "noapic" and "acpi=off" after pressing e, and then pressing b to boot it still freezes, so I am thinking perhaps that it was not those options, but the safe mode I selected with F4?
[05:53] <maco> Tanaric: ooo yeah quit it and then install those two packages, then run "sudo dpkg --configure -a" to finish configuring everything
[05:54] <Co2> you need to change your window manager from gnome to compiz
[05:54] <ubuntu_> sweet a chat thing cool
[05:54] <Tanaric> Great, thanks maco!
[05:54] <M1dn1ght> If this is so, is there a method to do such a thing with main installation?
[05:54] <cky> M1dn1ght: So do safe mode. Then, pick "resume" when the menu comes up, and see how far you get then.
[05:54] <alien> Co2: how
[05:54] <maco> Gman99999: cky suggested reinstalling.  thatd mean reboot and choose recovery mode from the menu and then run "aptitude reinstall sudo"
[05:54] <Gman99999> maco should this be reported as a bug?
[05:54] <Co2> i did it with the compiz fusion icon
[05:54] <alien> Co2: i dont have one ;(
[05:54] <Co2> i right clicked the icon in the sys tray and changed the settings in there..
[05:55]  * cky learnt how to reinstall a package. Thanks maco! :-)
[05:55] <Gman99999> ok
[05:55] <Tweaker> Why does pidgin freeze when I stream videos? Is there a problem wrong with the codec?
[05:55] <M1dn1ght> After I press escape at grub, is this the location where I must select safe mode?  the boot loader is different from install
[05:55] <Tanaric> maco: Actually, it's completely frozen -- keyboard and mouse are not responding. Ctrl+Alt+Backspace isn't even killing X. Any advice?
[05:55] <Meshezabeel> most dvds will not play under ubuntu, yet some play, I am guessing it is some sort of codec problem as they are good discs and the drive itself is good. Any ideas what I need to install?
[05:55] <alien> Co2: hey i havent updated anything in ubuntu yet
[05:55] <maco> Gman99999: unless you can tell what happened to make the configuration file go missing...like if you can say "when i installed <program> it deleted my /etc/sudoers" no
[05:55] <cky> M1dn1ght: Yes, that's where you put your cursor at safe mode, hit "e" to add those acpi parameters, and then boot as usual.
[05:55] <alien> Co2: i have 210 updates to update
[05:55] <Co2> try that.
[05:55] <alien> Co2: some of the stuff in there is compiz ..

Re-checked the 'Activate' nvidia drivers...rebooted, andi get a black screen beside of the login screen now.
[05:57] <macd> roachmmflhyr, for searching packages, 'apt-cache search packagename' works well ;)

[05:58] <roachmmflhyr> macd: thanks

[05:58] <Gman99999> maco I have no idea how to use visudo lol maybe reinstalling it would be easier
[05:58] <macd> roachmmflhyr, or -server, etc if thats what you have

[05:59] <cky> maco: Maybe not anymore (I just strings'd visudo). It used to.
[05:59] <Meshezabeel> mouseclone, any idea which gstreamer package? I have most of them installed
[05:59] <roachmmflhyr> macd: thanks
[05:59] <cky> maco: No, I don't know if it has anything to do with the bash input mode (although I'm a "set -o vi" user myself).
[05:59] <B_166-ER-X> pawan, welcometo the club
[05:59] <szx0> I'm curious if anyone here has used VirtualBox?
[06:00] <pawan> thanks
[06:00] <patifa> szx0 yep
[06:00] <cky> maco: But it used to use sensible-editor because it drove me up the wall, and reminded me that I needed to run "update-alternatives --config editor".
[06:00]  * pclynch smiles while upgrading to 8.04
[06:00] <szx0> patifa, What is the seamless mode like?
[06:00] <maco> cky: no i mean, i set $EDITOR=vi and set -o vi
[06:00] <pawan> where is the club
[06:00] <cky> maco: Like I said, strings seems to suggest it doesn't do that now. Maybe.
[06:00] <roachmmflhyr> macd: package doesnt exist
[06:00] <mouseclone> Meshezabeel: you will also have to know if the DVD is DRM or some type of encryption.. might not be supported by linux
[06:00] <cky> maco: Got it.
[06:00] <macd> !source
[06:00] <ubotu> You can easily fetch a package's source with apt-get. See: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
[06:00] <szx0> patifa, does it really feel like a blend of two O/S ?
[06:00] <maco> cky: i only know one other person that does set -o vi
[06:01] <macd> roachmmflhyr, that source line was directed at you
[06:01] <patifa> running windows as a guest, ubuntu as the host, seemless was pretty good.  I can't remember if the window manager reconized the windows or not, though.
[06:01] <patifa> I broke my windows guest install, however.
[06:01] <cky> maco: I don't literally "set -o vi", I have "set editing-mode vi" in my .inputrc. But same diff. :-P
[06:01] <szx0> patifa, k thx
[06:01] <maco> cky: combine with capslock-is-escape, and i get people all mixed up in my terminal;

[06:02] <cky> m1dn1ght: That's neat to know! :-)
[06:02] <m1dn1ght> However - can you recommend me perhaps where I may make this an automated process?

[06:02] <cky> maco: Hahaha!
[06:02] <patifa> And the linux guest additions for 8.04 don't work anymore
[06:02] <maco> cky: worst was when i had SCIM set to use shift+space and theyd start typing in japanese in the terminal
[06:02] <lartza_> I starts to say "Problem in program and Firefox browser closed unexpectedly and then that it can't update some program and setup closes
[06:02] <brunner> ﻿is apachectl normally packaged with apache?
[06:02] <InfernoX222> Does anyone have a moment to help fix my nvidia driver issue?
[06:02] <cky> maco: That's bitten me before, and I learnt to release the shift key before hitting space.
[06:03] <brunner> because I installed apache2, and I can't find it
[06:03] <maco> cky: me too.  they didnt.
[06:03] <lartza_> It says retty many programs and some of them are .py files

[06:03] <MrGnu> Hey, does anyone know of an issue with Hardy when you upgrade, where Amarok is choosing to use the motherboard sound chip instead of your sound card?
[06:03] <Tweaker> Enemy Territory
[06:03] <maco> alien: wesnoth, frets on fire
[06:04] <B_166-ER-X> alien- arena
[06:04] <cky> maco: Hahaha, oh dear. :-P
[06:04] <Tweaker> Alien: Enemy Territory and Dopewars
[06:04] <maco> ooo i need to install my Xplorer 360 driver
[06:04] <philip_> is totem crashing in hardy when playing an avi file for anyone?
[06:04] <MrGnu> I was just in the Amarok chat room, but people are either asleep or whatever
[06:04] <nickrud> brunner have you tried apache2ctl ?
[06:04] <brunner> ﻿apache2ctl?? how annoying
[06:04] <mouseclone> Dopewars is fun
[06:04] <alien> ok
[06:04] <InfernoX222> B-166-ER-X: yah i just upgraded but cant go about 800x600 in either program for my rez
[06:04] <Tweaker> I love Dopewars :)
[06:04] <MrGnu> But this seems to be a hardy issue
[06:04] <brunner> nickrud: I just figured that out
[06:04] <brunner> thanks
[06:04] <MrGnu> any help?
[06:04] <HAX_TEH_GIBS0N> Hey guys
[06:04] <maco> MrGnu: *just* amarok?
[06:04] <Tweaker> Anyways, why does Pidgin freeze when I stream videos?
[06:04] <maco> !hi | HAX_TEH_GIBS0N
[06:04] <ubotu> HAX_TEH_GIBS0N: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:04] <MrGnu> Yeah, its just Amarok maco
[06:05] <milly1234> i honestly think they should have put ff2 in hardy, and when ff3 became finalized give it as an upgrade option or something
[06:05] <mouseclone> alien: I'm also a fan of scorched 3D
[06:05] <maco> MrGnu: other sound apps are fine?
[06:05] <MrGnu> yeah
[06:05] <milly1234> ff2 as default that is
[06:05] <m1dn1ght> Hax_Teh_Gibson - that movie was almost as bad as your nick :P
[06:05] <MrGnu> All other sound apps are ine
[06:05] <MrGnu> fine
[06:05] <B_166-ER-X> InfernoX222 i upgraded yesterday...finnaly had to reinstall completely..and now nvidia drivers wont load, and i have no sound at all :) (thats what i can an 'UPGRADE' ;) )
[06:05] <MrGnu> Playing through my soundblaster card
[06:05] <MrGnu> Its just Amarok
[06:05] <mouseclone> alien: if you like the old cannon / worms games
[06:05] <HAX_TEH_GIBS0N> Dudes, my Ubuntu 8.04 now boots into BusyBox after updating everything via Synaptic. If anyone can help, would be much appreciated. If you need me to be specific about any details, tell me. :p
[06:05] <maco> milly1234: ff3b5 is awesome though...much less mem usage and nicely integrated with gtk2
=== roaksoax_ is now known as RoAk
=== RoAk is now known as RoAkSoAx
[06:05] <jsoftw> WHat is busybox?
[06:05] <djdeep> ﻿my ati x1900gt runs with the  fglrx driver, but my grafik fan is very fast. how can i fix this ?
[06:05] <InfernoX222> ﻿B-166-ER-X: damn... i think i might have to do a reinstall... if i could revert to the drivers i had before i would be fine... but i cant do that
[06:06] <InfernoX222> or rather i cant figure that out
[06:06] <B_166-ER-X> Firefox 3 barely supports addons..
[06:06] <milly1234> but it comes with neat features like... 100% CPU usage at random times, while freezing.
[06:06] <LSG> djdeep Hey i have the same card. Did you notice the animations are not as fluid as Gutsy's? Or is it just me?
[06:06] <mouseclone> B_166-ER-X: Sound is more than likely related to 2.6.24-12 kernel
[06:06] <HAX_TEH_GIBS0N> if anyone could help me, I'd be extremely grateful.... ;_;
[06:06] <MrGnu> lol terrible Milly1234 .. but I am sure that the addons situation has to change soon
[06:07] <smallfoot-> B_166-ER-X, firefox works fine for me with Adobe Flash, adblock, noscript
[06:07] <B_166-ER-X> mouseclone, ok.. is that deadly doc ?
[06:07] <Gman99999> maco I can't figure out how to boot into recovery mode, its been changed since the last update, obviously to keep newbs out from wrecking stuff
[06:07] <MrGnu> Well, Im going to try to do a reboot Maco, I dont think Im going to get anywhere anytime soon
[06:07] <alien> waiitt
[06:07] <MrGnu> Adios all
[06:07] <alien> waiit
[06:07] <maco> Gman99999: what? its not the second option?
[06:07] <alien> who said scorched 3d!
[06:07] <alien> is a genous
[06:07] <maco> MrGnu: are you on ubutnu or kubuntu?
[06:07] <mouseclone> B_166-ER-X: deadly doc?
[06:07] <MrGnu> Ubuntu
[06:07] <cky> Gman99999: You still just hit escape at GRUB, and pick option 2, like maco says.
[06:07] <mouseclone> B_166-ER-X: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ubuntu-modules-2.6.24/+bug/200338
[06:07] <B_166-ER-X> looking at how good goes my hardy upgrade, i think FF3 and Hardy goes well together.
[06:07] <maco> MrGnu: kde apps use a different way to access pulseaudio than ubuntu apps do
[06:08] <maco> MrGnu: er, than gnome ones do
[06:08] <alien> mouseclone: heyyyy
[06:08] <alien> mouseclone: scorched 3d :P
[06:08] <iRRVi> ubuntu 8.04...problem with audacity...cannot open sound device...you know what im talkin about...
[06:08] <milly1234> ff3 looks good yes... but is far from stable.
[06:08] <maco> MrGnu: is the pulseaudio esd plugin enabled?
[06:08] <B_166-ER-X> mouseclone thx
[06:08] <mouseclone> alien: you get it?
[06:08] <Gman99999> cky i picked the recovery mode in grub and it sends me to this screen and i have 3 options 1st one is to send me back to normal mode and i cant remember the rest
[06:08] <Tweaker> Im out bye
[06:08] <cky> Gman99999: Pick option 2.
[06:08] <laeg> can somebody help me open a port range in ufw? it won't accept 6881-6999
[06:08] <LSG> milly1234: Mine just stopped working. So i went back to FF2!
[06:08] <djdeep> @ lsg, i think the animations habe the same speed
[06:08] <B_166-ER-X> And if i fin the guy who thought it would be nice to completely remove xmms..
[06:08] <alien> mouseclone: im about tooo
[06:08] <mouseclone> B_166-ER-X: welcome.. I don't know what is going to happen.. I think that I will wait till patch for sound
[06:08] <Gman99999> cky  if i pick that i dont get a gui then
[06:08] <maco> cky: thats new
=== HAX_TEH_GIBS0N is now known as Cynic_AU
[06:09] <alien> mouseclone: that game is t he best! ;P
[06:09] <MrGnu> umm...  I dont know the answer, I went into amaroks auto detect but I did not see anything that picked out the card
[06:09] <maco> Gman99999: youre not supposed to get gui
[06:09] <maco> Gman99999: just command line so you can fix things
[06:09] <MrGnu> maco:  where can I see that?
[06:09] <LSG> djdeep: Damn...mine are really crappy now.
[06:09] <djdeep> the grafik fan runs fast why ?
[06:09] <cky> Gman99999: No, you don't get a GUI, it's just there to allow you to recover your system.
[06:09] <Gman99999> maco lol ok i dont know what to do then
[06:09] <cky> maco: Yeah.
[06:09] <mouseclone> alien: a good scrolling shooter is Chromium
[06:09] <maco> MrGnu: *shrug* somewhere in amarok's settings
[06:09] <maco> Gman99999: run "visudo"
[06:09] <mouseclone> alien: it is very hard
[06:09] <lartza_> Could someone help me? I upgraded to hardy(well it stopped) and now i did the not full dist upgrade what update manager suggested and it stopped to. "Couldn't install updates" just in beginning
[06:09] <cky> Gman99999: Pick option 2, then either "visudo" or "aptitude reinstall sudo". :-P
[06:09] <cky> Then "exit" and option 1 when you're done.
[06:09] <maco> Gman99999: or just run "aptitude reinstall sudo" to regenerate the config
[06:09] <LSG> djdeep: My card's fan is running normally...
[06:10] <cky> maco: Jinx!
[06:10] <maco> cky: ;)
[06:10] <maco> MrGnu: or "reboot" when you're done to...ya know...reboot
[06:10] <Gman99999> so if i log right into recovery mode i can just type in aptitude reinstall sudo and it will just go to work?
[06:10] <Gman99999> maco so if i log right into recovery mode i can just type in aptitude reinstall sudo and it will just go to work?
[06:10] <maco> Gman99999: should, yes
[06:10] <MrGnu> ok, I ll give that a shot thanks Maco
[06:10] <nickrud> Gman99999 if you altered /etc/sudoers, no
[06:10] <djdeep> with windows my grafik fan runs when i play games. but with ubuntu my grafik fan runs ever
[06:10] <mouseclone> lartza_: did you do an internet upgrade? or did you download the CD?
[06:11] <Gman99999> nickrub i deleted it
[06:11] <B_166-ER-X> mouseclone could always go back to last kernel right ?
[06:11] <lartza_> I noticed some error on terminal of part dist upgrade and it said something about root cache and maybe system
[06:11]  * roachmmflhyr cannot get rtl8180 wifi card to work!!!
[06:11] <Gman99999> nickrud i deleted it
[06:11] <laeg> i have ufw enabled with the default policy as deny - how come i can connect to irc and browse the web when i didn't open port 80/6667?
[06:11] <lartza_> mouseclone: internet, which failed by many errors
[06:11] <NW2190> Hi, I'm trying to use gtkmm.h in C++, but I keep getting "window.cpp:2:19: error: gtkmm.h: No such file or directory" even though I have gtkmm-2.4-dev installed. How can I fix that?
[06:11] <mouseclone> B-155-ER-X: I don't have the last kernel installed
[06:11] <djdeep> in windows i cant here the fan when i only surf
[06:11] <LSG> djdeep: You mean like at a very high speed?
[06:11] <milly1234> wifi seems to be flakey in Hardy
[06:11] <mouseclone> B-155-ER-X: I did a complete reinstall today
[06:11] <B_166-ER-X> ok
[06:11] <djdeep> yes i mean
[06:11] <blankhead> hey where do u go to or talk to to report bugs and stuff so that the developers know about it?
[06:11] <B_166-ER-X> so did i.
[06:11] <maco> laeg: havent looked at ufw, but im thinking thats for *inbound* but irc is *outbound*
[06:11] <nickrud> Gman99999 dpkg won't replace altered/removed files unless you tell it to explicitly; for yours I'd do sudo apt-get remove --purge sudo && apt-get install sudo
[06:12] <B_166-ER-X> but i cannot even log into my ubuntu now, all i get is a black screen after bootup :/
[06:12] <cky> NW2190: You need to add gtkmm's includes directories to your -I option too.
[06:12] <maco> Gman99999: listn to him. he makes sense.
[06:12] <iRRVi> everything except audacity works with audio...tried everything i could find...from `killall esd`ing to messin with the sound preferences
[06:12] <Gman99999> maco lol
[06:12] <LSG> djdeep: I have no idea what could be causing that, never happened to me. Sorry.
[06:12] <nickrud> Gman99999 and hope you have sudo in the package cache, network doesn't come up by default in recovery mode
[06:12] <Gman99999> nickrud thank you
[06:12] <blankhead> B_166-ER-X: did u mess around with the xorg.conf file?
[06:12] <cky> NW2190: Put $(pkg-config --cflags gtkmm-2.4) to your build line.
[06:12] <maco> nickrud: i thought reinstall would act like that so it could fix things
[06:12] <mouseclone> lartza_: if you have a burner download the upgrade from http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
[06:12] <milly1234> audacious seg faults on me...
[06:12] <maco> nickrud: it doesnt? weeeird
[06:13] <Gman99999> nickrud how i configure the network?
[06:13] <cky> NW2190: If you're using a Makefile, just have "CFLAGS += $(shell pkg-config --cflags gtkmm-2.4)"
[06:13] <mouseclone> lartza_: and check the box for alternate desktop
[06:13] <B_166-ER-X> blankhead i did a 'dpkg reconfigure' because my keyboard was all mixed up (azerty)
[06:13] <milly1234> I had to write my xorg.conf by hand in Hardy
[06:13] <lartza_> mouseclone: In installing packets it said "Firefox closed unexpectedly" hard to tell exactly cause I use finnish system. It gave me many errors with different programs closing like volumecontrol.py and then it stopped by couldn't update packet, but I don't remember the name
[06:13] <cky> NW2190: You will then also need "LDFLAGS += $(shell pkg-config --libs gtkmm-2.4)"
[06:13] <maco> Gman99999: to start network run "/etc/init.d/networking start"
[06:13] <nickrud> maco the package management system assumes you knew what you were doing when you changed config files. So, it will leave any altered ones alone
[06:13] <djdeep> when i deaktivate the grafik card and test vesa the fan isnt fast
[06:13] <mouseclone> lartza_: this will prevent packet errors due to over utlized servers and lack of bandwidth
[06:13] <B_166-ER-X> milly1234 jsut remove the crossfade plugin with synaptic
[06:13] <InfernoX222> does anyone know how to revert graphics drivers to teh hardy default?
[06:13] <johnny_> i knew it..
[06:13] <milly1234> B_166-ER-X, thank you.
[06:13] <maco> nickrud: linux assumes a lot about users' skill levels ;)
[06:13] <lartza_> mouseclone: Why did the update do that?
[06:13] <laeg> can somebody help me open a port range in ufw? it won't accept 6881-6999
[06:14] <B_166-ER-X> np
[06:14] <johnny_> anybody here had a problem with upgrades failing due to libGl.so.1
[06:14] <nickrud> Gman99999 I think all I had to do was sudo /etc/init.d/networking start
[06:14] <NW2190> cky: when I put the (pkg-config --cflags gtkmm-2.4) in I get an "unexpected '(' message.
[06:14] <lartza_> Update to gutsy from feisty was shitty too...
=== Jarwo is now known as paijo
[06:14] <blankhead> B_166-ER-X:oh man was it neccessary to do that all that..im sorry i couldnt help im a noob to linux i havent ever reconfigured dkpg or anything like that
[06:14] <djdeep> what grafik driver you have installed ?
[06:14] <cky> NW2190: You need a $ sign too. :-)
[06:14] <alien> ahhhhhhh
[06:14] <nickrud> Gman99999 I had a wired connection then, wireless would be harder
[06:14] <alien> nvmd
[06:14] <iRRVi> yarhg
[06:14] <crdlb> NW2190: it's $() not ()
[06:14] <LSG> djdeep: The restricted drivers
[06:14] <nickrud> maco it's a debian thing, they think sys admins ;)
[06:14] <bubblegumtate> I just upgraded and flash sound has stopped working, anyone know a fix?
[06:14] <maco> Gman99999: and you wouldnt use sudo when you start networking in recovery mode
[06:14] <Gman99999> nickrud ok i have a wired one thank you, this is an interesting learning experience for sure
[06:14] <blankhead> B_166-ER-X: i was just wondering cuz i know if u mess up the xorg.conf theres a way to fix it but sorry man
[06:15] <Gman99999> maco yea i figured that lol
[06:15] <B_166-ER-X> np
[06:15] <mouseclone> lartza_:  I did a live update once.  I have always downloaded the alt CD from then on.  With doing the live upgrade so close to release you end up with internet traffic problems.  That is from my experiance
[06:15] <maco> Gman99999: kk :)
[06:15] <Gman99999> maco nickrud thanks so much guys
[06:15] <nickrud> did I say sudo :)))
[06:15] <Gman99999> lord almighty

[06:16] <mouseclone> ghalib: do you have sound with anything else?
[06:16] <NW2190> cky: oh ya that worked, sort of.  It looks like it found the file, but it still doesn't compile and since Its an example on the gtkmm website I figure it should...
[06:16] <lartza_> mouseclone: I didn't have bandwidth issues. Issues came on package install.
[06:16] <ghalib> ya
[06:16] <MrObvious> Wow my wireless is slow on my BCM94311 and the B43 driver. I'm only connecting at 2Mbps and it feels really laggy. :(
[06:16] <NIghtFire> and they said 8.04 was stable and safe? It may be but looks like it don't work worth a hoot.
[06:16] <nickrud> DJDarkstar that's right, you're using the 3d drivers correctly
[06:16] <lartza_> Last time they were bandwidth erros

[06:17] <nickrud> maco as long as things are consistent and there's a policy for looking for new things it's all good
[06:17] <maco> laeg: oh
[06:17] <mouseclone> lartza_:  Like I said.  From my experiance those package issues are from a bad package due to it missing a packet or 2.

[06:17] <nickrud> djdeep yes, (sorry DJDarkstar )

[06:20] <laeg> can somebody help me open a port range in ufw? it won't accept 6881-6999 but it will accept single port entries
[06:20] <nickrud> djdeep that's a different issue from having the right driver. Don't have that card so I've never messed with fan speed

[06:20] <crdlb> Byan: that's impossible. The "old" switcher is part of metacity
[06:20] <cky> NW2190: Thanks.
[06:20] <mouseclone> lartza_: i have no idea what caused firefox to crash on you in the middle of an upgrade
[06:20] <MrGnu> Hey Maco, thanks, It was in the settings
[06:20] <maco> quasar8888: nerds use their command line counterparts, and people helping here do as well because the command line is always the same, whereas kde has adept instead of synaptic
[06:20] <MrGnu> Just wanted to let you know, great job, thank you for helping me again!
[06:20] <Byan> crdlb: hmm, ok
[06:20] <quasar8888> I really want to install DEV-C++
[06:20] <djdeep> i can hear a difference between the systems
[06:20] <cky> NW2190: Okay, your program compiled fine. It just didn't link fine.
[06:21] <maco> quasar8888: to use add/remove or synaptic or adept, just search for what you want, mark the checkbox, and hit apply
[06:21] <Vlet> I've never understood why online tutorials that are giving instructions on how to do fairly simple things, or in chatrooms like this where people are asking notice questions, why people instruct them to use vi
[06:21] <cky> NW2190: What is the command line you're using to build it?
[06:21] <lartza_> mouseclone: Adn a dozen of other progs, when i updated o gutsy i did a terminal upgrade cause the graphical failed ot fetch something, but now it's really differen
[06:21] <nickrud> Vlet cuz it's on every system. Not all have pico or nano
[06:21] <MrGnu> maco: The reboot did not work but when I chose the actual alsmixer instead of autodetect that repaired the problem.
[06:21] <maco> Vlet: usually we recommend nano...except for like...me...because i dont have nano's stuff memorized and i can tell vi commands easily
[06:21] <cky> Vlet: Because vi is the lowest common denominator, except ed. :-P
[06:21] <patifa> yeah VLet, vi is not a program for a novice.
[06:21] <maco> MrGnu: ok
[06:21] <cky> Vlet: Maybe ed is a better choice, I guess. :-P :-P :-P
[06:21] <MrGnu> Good night all
[06:22] <djdeep> the radeon drivers dont run with x1900gt ?
[06:22] <m1dn1ght> Can anyone please tell me how about increasing the maximum resolution on my screen?  I seem to be stuck with 800x600 as the max when I try and change it
[06:22] <patifa> give them nano or something, otherwise they'll be lost in vi
[06:22] <hydrogen> except, I can't give instructions on how to do something in nano
[06:22] <deshawn> three forty four, six hundred and twenty three broad for a report of a fight involving at the bar, start over code-2 with a car to back
[06:22] <cky> m1dn1ght: I thought your computer only worked with safe graphics mode.
[06:22] <mouseclone> Vlet: vi is install on every system from Sun to BSD to Linux, I even think that Mac has vi installed
[06:22] <Radtoo^laptop> Or tell them about :w and :q. :D
[06:22] <maco> Vlet: all *nix systems have vi, so online that makes sense. here, nano's the default recommendation because it's guaranteed to be on all ubuntu systems
[06:22] <alien> macd: hey i couldnt get that fusion-icon
[06:22] <deshawn> three forty one backing
[06:22] <alien> macd: pack dont exist
[06:22] <cky> m1dn1ght: In which case, you can't get better resolution without killing your system. :-(
[06:22] <hydrogen> and, nano does not handle word wrapping properly by default, for some stupid reason
[06:22] <deshawn> vi > nano

[06:23] <maco> alien: what ubuntu are you using?
[06:23] <NW2190> cky: oh I see, I mixed up the order.  it should be $g++ window.cpp `pkg-config gtkmm-2.4 --cflags --libs`. Thanks for all the help.
[06:23] <cky> NW2190: Hahaha. Glad to see it works for you then. :-)
[06:23] <NW2190> cky: haha ya.
[06:23] <m1dn1ght> oh - I thought this was a temporary thing.  I assumed once I had ubuntu up and running I could download the appropriate drivers maybe?
[06:23] <B_166-ER-X> ok, for some random reason, my ubuntu just loaded normally this time.    (altough i still do not have nvidia support)
[06:23] <alien> maco: 710

[06:23] <alien> macd: 710

[06:24] <nickrud> m1dn1ght what video chip do you have?  lspci | grep -i vga will tell you
[06:24] <deshawn> is it true that ubuntu funds terrorism somewhere along the line
[06:24] <maco> alien: ok i packaged that up
[06:24] <maco> alien: https://edge.launchpad.net/~maco.m/+archive
[06:24] <cky> NW2190: So, write out the pkg-config twice, with things in correct order. :-P
[06:24] <deshawn> excuse me, is it true that ubuntu funds terrorism somewhere along the line?
[06:24] <mouseclone> B166erx: are you using restricted drivers?
[06:24] <djdeep> @lsd have you test the radeon drivers
[06:24] <nickrud> deshawn take that to ##politics

[06:26] <maco> alien: and make sure you added the gutsy not hardy lines
[06:26] <B166erx> mouseclone
[06:27] <mouseclone> B166erx: ??
[06:27] <djdeep> for some ati cards you can install the "radeon" driver
[06:27] <cky> m1dn1ght: It might not be supported. The info I have is at http://www.winischhofer.eu/linuxsispart1.shtml#12
[06:27] <cky> m1dn1ght: I don't know if that's the most up-to-date info though.
[06:27] <LSG> djdeep: For Linux?
[06:27] <B166erx> exactly
[06:27] <nickrud> m1dn1ght m1dn1ght there's a driver for it, I gotta remember
[06:27] <evilbug> if i install the new nvidia driver for my geforce 4 mx and it doesn't work,can i just reconfigure xserver after to restore everything to normal? [i'm running 7.10]
[06:27] <djdeep> yes
[06:28] <mouseclone> evilbug: it should have made a back up of your xorg.conf file.  You can just rename that as well
[06:28] <LSG> djdeep: I don't know man, i always use the restricted drivers, they work fine
[06:28] <B166erx> my ubuntu is still more silent than a dead weasel. though. (but it have nice graphic to cope now :) )
[06:28] <Gman99999> nickrud now when i use sudo this is what it says, I reinstalled it btw "g is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported."
[06:28] <m1dn1ght> thank you for the info!  I will hope nickrud remembers this driver while I look on this page you send CKY
[06:28] <mouseclone> B166erx: then you are in my boat
[06:28] <evilbug> mouseclone- thanks!
[06:29] <nickrud> Gman99999 g is your username?
[06:29] <Gman99999> nickrud yes
[06:29] <mouseclone> B166erx: i guess I could use the onboard sound card
[06:29] <nickrud> Gman99999 is it the original user, or a newly added one?
[06:29] <evilbug> mouseclone- do you think it's better to install the driver via synaptic as opposed to manually?
[06:29] <Gman99999> nickrud its the original one
[06:29] <B166erx> 'Ubuntu Hardy -Graphic Level up !

[06:30] <evilbug> samliu- thanks.
[06:30] <samliu> wait what do you mean by manually
[06:30] <sirhcjw> hey all i am having an issue with 8.04 server
[06:30] <B166erx> mouseclone is it just a problem with '32 bits sound blasters' ?
[06:30] <samliu> you mean like aptitude or apt-get right
[06:30] <djdeep> ok the radeon driver only runs till x850
[06:30] <djdeep> http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/ATI-Grafikkarten/radeon
[06:30] <mouseclone> evilbug: well if you are wanting support, I would say synaptic.  But I have used the nVidia latest build before when I want to over clock the card
[06:30] <evilbug> samliu- i mean by downloading it and compiling it.
[06:30] <m1dn1ght> Cky: I always manage to choose a system with crappy hardware!!
[06:30] <sirhcjw> my account seems to be not working
[06:30] <Gman99999> nickrud ok some packages also got uninstalled when i reinstalled sudo, like iced tea and stuff like that
[06:30] <sirhcjw> i can't login
[06:30] <evilbug> i want to install it because video playback is pretty bad.
[06:30] <cky> m1dn1ght: That's a shame. :-(
[06:30] <nickrud> m1dn1ght install xserver-xorg-video-sis (duh)
[06:30] <mouseclone> B166erx:  I don't really know.. I stopped looking after if found the answer about the audigy card
[06:30] <evilbug> thanks guys,i'm going to go see what happens :)
[06:31] <samliu> yeah if you want to overclock thats the only time it makes a difference

[06:31] <m1dn1ght> sorry for awkwardness, but I am linux newbie.  Do I just type that command in terminal?
[06:31] <milly1234> that works good with ubuntu
[06:31] <sls> ok
[06:32] <dupin> hi
[06:32]  * mouseclone is unsure if the new gtkpod will do mv4 movies yet
[06:32] <Gman99999> nickrud all I did was type in aptitude reinstall sudo and it said yes or no lol

[06:32] <nickrud> m1dn1ght   sudo apt-get install  xserver-xorg-video-sis , then log out and back in. If X is as smart as it's supposed to be now, it should recognized the driver
[06:32] <Willizar> i need "msn messanger " tha i can use my mic and headphones
[06:32] <deshawn> is linux the most secure OS every created?
[06:32] <cky> nickrud: I thought that driver is installed by default.
[06:33] <cky> nickrud: Also its manpage doesn't mention 671 or 771...hmm....
[06:33] <deshawn> a friend tells me it is the most secure OS ever created, is that true?
[06:33] <maco> alien: umm...is it not working after it says that?
[06:33] <Starnestommy> deshawn: I think OpenBSD is, but Linux is very secure
[06:33] <nickrud> Gman99999 you probably didn't loose anything important, but it's a good idea to write down things like that
[06:33] <tokyoahead> how can I add a user to a certain group?
[06:33] <maco> deshawn: your friend hasnt heard of openbsd
[06:33] <alien> maco: i see no change

[06:34] <B166erx> mouseclone , ok , jumping to another problem (altough probably much simple to solve)   i have 3 hard drives, 2 others than this one, i can 'mount' them but i would like them to be 'auto mounted' on boot

[06:34] <m1dn1ght> should I logout/login now?
[06:35] <alien> maco: ahh
[06:35] <m1dn1ght> I don't think it changed anything, right?
[06:35] <nickrud> m1dn1ght sounds like you have it.   do   gedit /var/log/Xorg.0.log , and copy and paste to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[06:35] <alien> maco: i see it now but i might of messed something up when i did fusion-icon from terminal
[06:35] <randin-> is there anyway to revert the hda to sda conversion in hardy?
[06:35] <nickrud> m1dn1ght nope, no change

[06:37] <djdeep> ok i activate it, but then the 3d games dont run then anymore
[06:37] <nickrud> m1dn1ght ok, it sees the sis chip but is using the vesa driver.  now show us /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:37] <maco> mouseclone: gksu on graphical apps. sudo + graphical = possible uh oh
[06:38] <dupin> hi
[06:38] <Willizar> nickrud:  when you would be free just call me ok?
[06:38] <LSG> djdeep: Yeah you can't have the cube and 3D games at the same time.
[06:38] <mouseclone> maco: kk
[06:38] <cky> nickrud: Bear in mind it's using vesa driver because of using safe graphics mode, apparently using non-safe graphics mode crashes the computer? So I was told.
[06:38] <djdeep> why ?
[06:38] <LSG> djdeep: Just deactivate it whenever you're playing.
[06:38] <mouseclone> maco: i will try to remember that
[06:38] <cky> nickrud: So definitely good to keep the safemode xorg.conf around just in case.
[06:38] <djdeep> yes i do this
[06:38] <nickrud> Willizar eww, msn and kopete ;) Anyway, I've never set up a camera and mike before
[06:38] <zl3cat> I have cube and 3d games and fullscreen movies atr the same time
[06:38] <djdeep> because why
[06:38] <B166erx> mouseclone, i know you cant do much with distance .. but, is there a simple way to know.. what to enter here ? i already done this, buta few ubuntus  back .. :/
[06:38] <Willizar> ok nickrud

[06:39] <zl3cat> get an nvidia then :)
[06:39] <maco> zl3cat: youre lucky if you can do that.
[06:39] <Leeuw> Willizar: maybe I was wrong about the mic; I can' t check now, my kopete' s broken...   But Kopete has plugins too, probably there' s one for mics, go to th menu in contact list, configure plugins, check there if there' s one, else follow the link to see if you can download one.    There' s also another prog for msn: emesene, try that ?
[06:39] <zeeeee> hi, after upgrading from 7.10 to 8.04, typing in filenames doesn't take me to the file anymore in nautilus or the open file dialog... did this get disabled? can i enable it?
[06:39] <cky> m1dn1ght: I bet you $10 that nickrud's suggestion is change the vesa to sis. :-)
[06:39] <Willizar> kopete its a KDA program so lets ask kubuntu
[06:39] <Willizar> :D
[06:40] <cky> m1dn1ght: Because that would be my first suggestion too.
[06:40] <nickrud> m1dn1ght see cky above ;)
[06:40] <maco> zl3cat: well theyre most recent drivers have caused issues, and theyve stopped giving proper support to some cards, so that's not even a great answer anymore
[06:40] <djdeep> when you play a video for example with vlc d divx the qualitiy isnt so good like windows
[06:40] <m1dn1ght> when I booted, I had to press esc at grub, select "recovery", then e, then "noapic" and "acpi=off".  I then had to press b, then select resume.  As cky said, this process may mean I am giving you poor information
[06:40] <djdeep> why
[06:40] <LSG> zl3cat: I'm happy with my ATI =) I don't play games anyway
[06:40] <spideyman> how do i get my script to open terminal since the prog it envoke is a terminal prog? it works good but i cant see what its doing

[06:41] <bod_> bazhang: hey dude, are you about?
[06:41] <evilbug> the nvidia-glx-new doesn't work for me.
[06:41] <nks_> Maybe someone can help me out there ! - I would like to know if someone knows how to enable graphics acceleration on a Mac 2.16 ghz. laptop with ubuntu 8.04 using vmware !
[06:41] <m1dn1ght> OK - change vesa to sis makes sense.  Do I make this change in xorg.conf?
[06:41] <nickrud> m1dn1ght no, that's a different hardware issue (probably)
[06:41] <bazhang> bod_: hi!
[06:41] <cky> m1dn1ght: Did you get a chance to edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst in the end, and add those options to your kopt line?
[06:41] <cky> m1dn1ght: Yes, in that file.
[06:41] <bazhang> your computer still sooty, bod_? ;]
[06:41] <mouseclone> B166erx:  the easiest thing to do is copy the line above it and change the UUID and the / or mount point
[06:41] <osmosis> what package gives the 'host' command ?
[06:41] <cky> m1dn1ght: e.g., "kopt=root=... ro noapic"
[06:41] <m1dn1ght> Cky - I was trying to figure out the editor command.  I know now it's gedit :)
[06:41] <Tjh__> hey guys i tried to use the new CD for  ubuntu
[06:41] <maco> mouseclone: i think we need a graphical way to edit /etc/fstab
[06:41] <nickrud> m1dn1ght do:   cd /etc/X11 && sudo cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.beforenickrudmuckedabout && sudo gedit xorg.conf   , then edit vesa to sis. Save, log out and back in
[06:41] <m1dn1ght> so I have yet to make permenant those changes
[06:41] <bod_> bazhang: hey bazhang,.,. im angry with hardy now -- can you help me with a GRUB error 22 issue plz? that was my dads compi was on while mine was BORKED!!!
[06:41] <djdeep> the faces are little bit crap
[06:42] <cky> m1dni1ght: Oh, sorry, I meant "# kopt=root=... ro noapic" (don't strip out the #).
[06:42] <mouseclone> B166erx: also make sure that if you use /home/username/folder that folder exist
[06:42] <yuri_> i need some advice. im running 7.10 right now and do not have a pressing reason to upgrade to 8.04. what is at stake here?
[06:42] <bazhang> hang on bod_ let me check something
[06:42] <dupin> Tjh__ :and?
[06:42] <bod_> yuri_: dont uprade for a few more weeks (at least)
[06:42] <B166erx> mouseclone , yeah i got that ;)     altought, i think its late. my brain is half asleep, running on geekness alone a 1:42 am.
[06:42] <cky> nickrud: For graphical programs always use gksudo. :-)
[06:42] <bod_> bazhang: k, cheers m8
[06:42] <JohnnyWells> Are there any WORKING programs I can use to remove the DDRM on my Itunes library?
[06:42] <maco> m1dn1ght: except where it says "sudo gedit" make that "gksudo gedit"
[06:42] <Tjh__> when i boot up it gives me the menu, anything i select ends up in "IO error: Boot disk failure"
[06:42] <cky> maco: Yes!
[06:42] <maco> er...what cky said
[06:42] <hydrogen> JohnnyWells: no.
[06:42] <ceil420> what's the command to see where a symlink is pointing?
[06:42] <Tjh__> or smthg along those line
[06:42] <nickrud> cky oh my god, I've said that thousands of times ;(. I even know why ;-p
[06:42]  * bod_ notices no one talks to him unless they no him
[06:42] <spideyman> how do i get my script to open terminal since the prog it envoke is a terminal prog? it works good but i cant see what its doing
[06:42] <Tjh__> *lines
[06:42] <bazhang> bod_: is this a dual boot or only ubuntu
[06:42] <yuri_> bod_: are there still major bugs to be worked out?
[06:43] <bod_> bazhang: dual
[06:43] <hydrogen> ceil420: readlink
[06:43] <B166erx> mouseclone , my question now, is, Hardy Auto detect and 'auto name' the Hard drive 'Media **gig'   , wont if make a conflict ?
[06:43] <ceil420> hydrogen, cheers
[06:43] <maco> yuri_: sloooow repositories
[06:43] <mouseclone> B166erx: same time here.. but I do this in my sleep.. mostly server work though on Windows.  I'm just trying to learn Linux mo'better
[06:43] <JohnnyWells> Hydrogen, you're kidding. You mean....Apple won
[06:43] <B166erx> ok
=== Areli1 is now known as Arelis
[06:43] <bod_> yuri_: im definately experiencing them 2 & 1/2 days debugging as we speak
[06:43] <cky> Okay, must go. nickrud sounds plenty capable of seeing you through this, m1dn1ght; all the best!
[06:43] <m1dn1ght> ok - I changed vesa to sis
[06:43] <dupin> Tjh__ di you checked  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM
[06:43] <m1dn1ght> I will log out now
[06:43] <maco> hydrogen: really? i always ls -l it!
[06:43] <yuri_> bod_: noted. thanks for the heads up
[06:43] <m1dn1ght> thank you cky!
[06:43] <Tjh__> yes i md5summed it
[06:43] <m1dn1ght> you were much helpfull!

[06:44] <parkar86> Hello, I need some help recompiling the b43 kernel module for Hardy
[06:44] <bod_> yuri_: no probs -- the beta was exce;;ent the full release seems shabby
[06:44] <bod_> lol
[06:44] <EddieDied> morning, how do I restore initrd.img-2.6.24-16-386 from a livecd?
[06:44] <cky> m1dn1ght: I can only hope. :-) Still, glad to be of help.
[06:44] <cky> Uh, too late.
[06:44] <mouseclone> B166erx: right now your drive is more than likely mounted @ /media/disk-1 and /media/disk-2
[06:44] <dupin> Tjh__   : and disc integrity?
[06:44] <maco> yuri_: also there's a bug where none of us are all that used to debugging hardy yet...we're used to how the old stuff worked
[06:44] <ceil420> hmm
[06:44] <ceil420> how can i confirm that a file is a symlink?
[06:44] <Tjh__> eh?
[06:44] <mouseclone> B166erx: it will not automount them once inside of fstab
[06:44] <maco> yuri_: us helpers need to be debugged ;)
[06:44] <B166erx> mousclone something  kie this, yeap
[06:44] <bod_> maco: worked being the operative word
[06:44] <B166erx> ok
[06:44] <sls> ok maybe i am an idiot but there is no obvious way to get movies to my ipod using gtkpod.
[06:44] <nickrud> hahaha, three quarters of the bugs are simply 'changes'
[06:44] <maco> bod_: :P
[06:44] <parkar86> ls -l and see if it points to something in console
[06:44] <dupin> Tjh__ :that is option when you boot CD
[06:44] <ceil420> $ readlink -v Ceil.txt
[06:44] <ceil420> readlink: Ceil.txt: Invalid argument
[06:44] <Tjh__> o i burned onto a CD-RW (is that a problem)
[06:44] <parkar86> colors help
[06:44] <mouseclone> B166erx: well not using automount
[06:45] <yuri_> maco: lol. devs need to be recompiled. gotcha
[06:45] <maco> bod_: well the ways in which the old things failed and the ways to fix them.
[06:45] <EddieDied> apparently I have initrd.img-2.6.24-16-386 deleted so I can't boot into ubuntu, how do I restore this file?
[06:45] <blankhead> anyone knows why the media button on the keyboard doesnt pop up the default multimedia app?
[06:45] <mouseclone> B166erx: they will mount when the system starts
[06:45] <bod_> sls: i may be being siully but have u tried dra and drop in nautilus?
[06:45] <B166erx> now, its late , i have a hard time finding the /dev  of my hd's
[06:45] <Arelis> Has anyone here got Ubuntu looking -EXACTLY- like Vista?
[06:45] <bod_> maco: yeah ;|)
[06:45] <ceil420> Arelis, why on earth would you want to do that?
[06:45] <dupin> Tjh__ : I don´t think so.Check Cd for errors
[06:45] <maco> Arelis: why would we want to?
[06:45] <bod_> ;-)
[06:45] <Tjh__> Arelis: not personally but i have seen examples of it yes
[06:45] <nickrud> B166erx a nice trick is blkid
[06:45] <nks_> Hello, is there a way for me to enable graphics acceleration on a Macbook 2.16 ghz. using ubuntu 8.04 on vmware ?
[06:45] <blankhead> it use to work in gutsy all the time... i press the media button on my keyboard and out pops up banshee (my default multimedia app)
[06:45] <Tjh__> uuuh how to do that in a goood way?
[06:45] <alien> maco: lol .. still i dont think its workign right
[06:46] <maco> nks_: i dont think you can do 3D in a vm
[06:46] <blankhead> is there a place where i could submit a bug for this?
[06:46] <nickrud> nks_ inside vmware? there's experimental stuff for that, but no simple way
[06:46] <B166erx> nickrud ?
[06:46] <maco> alien: whats it doing?
[06:46] <mouseclone> B166erx:  here is my fstab with the /home directory mounted on a different drive http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64642/
[06:46] <Arelis> ceil420: well, if you don't want to buy vista, and don't want to work in vista, and don't have a vista-capable pc :P
[06:46] <bazhang> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351 bod_ you seen this?
[06:46] <parkar86> so... if i need to recompile a driver... do i have to recompile the kernel... or can i just get away with recompiling the driver and loading it
[06:46] <dupin> Tjh__ :you will see that option when you boot CD
[06:46] <nks_> wow -LOL-
[06:46] <nickrud> B166erx to find out your hd /dev paths
[06:46] <sls> bod_ yse that does work as any USB drive would... but they are not visible in the ipod. it says "no movies" when infect there are ipod movies there.
[06:46] <EddieDied> please need help, I have school in 1/2 hour and I have homework to print out, how do I restore initrd.img-2.6.24-16-386 in ubuntu?
[06:46] <ceil420> Arelis, there are many, MANY themes that look better than Aero...
[06:46] <maco> alien: you should be able to right click it and select compiz or metacity from "select window manager"
[06:46] <Gman99999> nickrud when i tried to add my account as an admin it said it was already in the admin group and then i logged in again and just for fun i checked and once again it says g is not in the sudoes file
[06:46] <bod_> bazhang: oh, it may be because i have a seperate / and/home now?
[06:46] <B166erx> nickrud, yeap,  but it does nothing here
[06:46] <Tjh__> o yes like i said ALL THE OPTIONS TURN UP THE ERROR
[06:46] <maco> alien: should also be able to open the settings manager from it
[06:46] <Arelis> ceil420: would you give me an example, please?
[06:46] <bazhang> nks_: nay, parallels may have some basic gfx though (paid for not free)
[06:46] <Tjh__> and i mean ALL
[06:46] <ceil420> Arelis, if you go for "exactly like Vista", you're like, a wannabe Vista-user. and that's worse than an actual Vista-user.
[06:47] <ceil420> Arelis, www.gnome-look.org
[06:47] <maco> alien: i didnt write it by the way...just pulled a snapshot from svn and compiled it
[06:47] <parkar86> lol
[06:47] <bod_> bazhang: no but il try it now if you thinkit will help
[06:47] <Tjh__> well except it gets into the wubi fine
[06:47] <bazhang> bod_: should do
[06:47] <maco> alien: so i dont know how it works, just how to use it
[06:47] <EddieDied> even a hint?
[06:47] <dupin> Tjh__ : can you burn it on lower speed
[06:47] <bod_> bazhang: kk, back in a bit
[06:47] <parkar86> any help of recompiling drivers
[06:47] <parkar86> ?
[06:47] <nickrud> B166erx one of the 'bugs', use sudo blkid (it changed)
[06:47] <EddieDied> anyone?
[06:47] <mouseclone> B166erx: df in console you should be able to see the /dev/sda1
[06:47] <zeeeee> hi, after upgrading from 7.10 to 8.04, typing in filenames doesn't take me to the file anymore in nautilus or the open file dialog... did this get disabled? can i enable it?
[06:47] <Jarryd> hey
[06:47] <Arelis> ceil420: well most of those themes.. i don't like 'em
[06:47] <LSG> ceil420 Maybe Arelis just likes how Vista looks like?
[06:47] <nks_> so there a link for me to test the experimental ?
[06:47] <Arelis> ceil420: i mean, the most on the frontpage (highest rating)
[06:47] <Tjh__> dupin: i burnt it at 10 do i need lower?
[06:48] <sls> is there a program that actually will sync movies to my ipod in linux?
[06:48] <ceil420> Arelis, so use search terms to find something you do like
[06:48] <Jarryd> burn it at as lower speed as possible
[06:48] <EddieDied> is anyone here helping users with ubuntu?
[06:48] <brent113> Arelis, look at the community emerald theme, it's what I use
[06:48] <Jarryd> um
[06:48] <B166erx> nicee
[06:48] <B166erx> thx
[06:48] <amirman84> hi, is kpowersave a good app? is it safe to install? as a KDE app will it mess with GNOME?
[06:48] <maco> Arelis: lets start with "what do you like"?
[06:48] <maco> brent113: emerald is not supported
[06:48] <dupin> Tjh__ If you can yes
[06:48] <Jarryd> I am a nub
[06:48] <bazhang> sls: you can try gtkpod
[06:48] <m1dn1ght> Nickrud: when I logged back in I got a window informing me I was in low graphics mode and giving me the option to configure my display.  I chose sis from the list, but when I run test the screen flickered, a green bar apeared momentarily and then it said configuration had failed
[06:48] <ceil420> LSG, s/he didn't say "similar to Vista", it apparently has to look "EXACTLY like Vista". that's not being a fan of the theme, that's being a poser for the OS.
[06:48] <maco> brent113: the compiz team doesnt even support it.
[06:48] <alien> maco:  lol
[06:48] <Jarryd> I burnt a copy using my laptop burner. Fail.
[06:48] <maco> Arelis: dont use emerald. its crashy
[06:48] <brent113> maco: then why am I using it?
[06:48] <bazhang> EddieDied: not on your time deadline no
[06:48] <sls> bazhang, I have but it is so not obvious... Pointers?
[06:48] <maco> brent113: because you put up with it?
[06:49] <EddieDied> all I want is how to restore initrd.img-2.6.24-16-386 in ubuntu.
[06:49] <Arelis> maco: I like a theme that belongs to the genre Fantasy.
[06:49] <brent113> I've never had it crash ever
[06:49] <Arelis> maco: I do not like all the industrial and metal and plastic stuff
[06:49] <Tjh__> hmm will try that then
[06:49] <maco> brent113: i have it installed too, but it crashes all the tim so i stopped using it.  on nvidia it slows everything down.  compiz team said they dont support it and *might* replace it, but the code base will be totally scrapped
[06:49] <Tjh__> o god that will take long
[06:49] <nks_> oooppppssss- I mean--is there a link available for me to test the experimental to get the graphics acceleration working, for the vmware + mac + ubuntu 8.04?
[06:49] <LSG> ceil420: Haha...well maybe you're right.
[06:49] <nickrud> Gman99999 put a copy of your /etc/sudoers file on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org . You are probably going to have to boot back into recovery mode and enable the root account for a while, to aid troubleshooting.   do  passwd <password> in recovery mode, then type exit to get back to the gui. Then you can read /etc/sudoers and pastebin it.
[06:49] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: I think it's part of linux-image-$(uname -r)
[06:49] <bazhang> sls the ubuntu wiki has a link for the iPhone and iPod-->you on gutsy or hardy
[06:49] <brent113> maco: I'm sorry for the experience you've had, but I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with it.
[06:49] <ceil420> :p
[06:49] <LSG> Arelis: Glassy then!
[06:49] <ceil420> now then
[06:49] <AdemoS> So, 7.10 can see and connect to all wifi networks in my house. But 8.04 cannot SEE any wifi networks...? Ubuntu Studio 8.04 seems to be missing gnome-network-manager entirely....What is going on with Hardy? I was told it was the STABLE SOLID release, but I had better luck with Gutsy, which was supposedly more "expiremental...."
[06:50] <achandrashekar> allright after solving a not being able to sudo because of edited host file, and vmware workstation blowing up, I have 8.04 "functioning". However, when I have my brick lugged into my laptop, i get a strange acpi error..any ideas on what this ?
[06:50] <ceil420> how can i tell if a file is a link?
[06:50] <mouseclone> I like the "main menu" it saves some space on the bar, and is like the start or K menu
[06:50] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: and how do I install that?
[06:50] <media64> hey, i just installed Ubuntu 8.04, and my screen res is fucked up
[06:50] <maco> brent113: on which ubuntu and with which drivers?
[06:50] <sls> bazhang, Im on hardy.
[06:50] <amirman84> will kpowersave mess with GNOME?
[06:50] <EddieDied> I have just that file missing in /boot/
[06:50] <dupin> Tjh__ :or you can download same iso with torrent and point download to the folder with existin iso.That way torent will check your iso for errors and replace bad file with good ones
[06:50] <nickrud> Gman99999 when you're done, do sudo passwd -l root , to disable the root login again.
[06:50] <Jarryd> um, when i attempt to load it up, it jams on "Loading Linux Kernel 100%"
[06:50] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: with apt-get install
[06:50] <Arelis> LSG: or wooden..
[06:50] <brent113> maco: hardy, nvidia-glx-new
[06:50] <nickrud> m1dn1ght not sure then. I've never used the sis chip. Let me do a little googling
[06:50] <Tjh__> hmm interesting
[06:50] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: im on a livecd, how will that work?
[06:50] <Tjh__> yes...
[06:50] <LSG> Arelis: Or paper...y..
[06:50] <MEtaLpREs_> ugg... well so far atleast for me Hard y is total crap and it looks like im going back to gutsy
[06:50] <EddieDied> I cant boot in ubuntu
[06:50] <m1dn1ght> thanks nickrud!  I really appreciate the help.
[06:50] <media64> i already installed the drivers, it actually reduced my res from 800x600 to 640x480
[06:51] <bazhang> sls search term should be ubuntu hardy iPhone and that leads directly to the wiki link for both iPhones and iPods
[06:51] <kunzy> Can anyone help me with a GRUB Error 17
[06:51] <media64> and i have absolutely no Linux experience
[06:51] <Tjh__> Eddie: cant you pull it off the CD?
[06:51] <cfreeze> on a postmordem of a ubuntu install (aka DOA hardy install), what would be the best way of pulling what packages were installed?  I know on a live system I can do dpkg --get-selections, but on a dead one..
[06:51] <Jarryd> Hey EddieDied -- Burn it at a low speed on a real burner. Not laptop
[06:51] <dupin> MEtaLpREs_ :every new release need polish
[06:51] <EddieDied> Tjh__: uhh and just copy it?
[06:51] <sls> bazhang, ok
[06:51] <yuri_> how do i get the description of a package i have yet to install through the commandline? something like apt-cache desc package?
[06:51] <Tjh__> Eddie: mkinitcpio
[06:51] <B166erx> mouseclone , hm, the UUID, i add it manually, but hm,    is it the same that sudo blkid gives me ?
[06:51] <maco> brent113: it crashes on my intel on hardy....worked fine-ish on gutsy & feisty (only a little crashy...not any more than beryl was).  on my friend's nvidia it just turned the whole system slow.  #compiz-fusion said to get rid of emerald because they wont be fixing any bugs.  quinn (the one that made beryl) said it's spaghetti code and should go
[06:51] <Tjh__> Eddie: man mkinitcpio
=== deshawn is now known as JewRat
[06:51] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: oh.  In that case, you will need to mount the filesystem to a temporary directory, chroot into it, then run update-initramfs
[06:51] <achandrashekar> btw....for those that are upgrading...vmware will need re-configuring...thats workstation that is..
[06:51] <EddieDied> Jarryd: I had ubuntu running, I just have initrd.img-2.6.24-16-386 deleted from my HD
[06:51] <ceil420> yuri_, apt-cache show packagename
[06:51] <bazhang> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351 try this kunzy
[06:51] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: ok thanks will try that
[06:51] <Tjh__> Eddie: or that
[06:51] <Jarryd> oh
[06:51] <maco> brent113: if it works for you, great, but its not being supported upstream at all
[06:51] <LSG> Arelis: You made me want to get a nice theme now
[06:51] <nickrud> m1dn1ght that was a 771/671 , right?
[06:52] <amirman84> does anyone here use KPowersave?
[06:52] <yuri_> ceil420: excellent. ty
[06:52] <Arelis> LSG: heh :P
[06:52] <ceil420> np :)
[06:52] <JewRat> 420 <3
[06:52] <Myrtti> I feel like such a newcomer again. How does one change the display driver in Hardy?
[06:52] <kunzy> bazhang     k, will give it a read
[06:52] <AdemoS> So, 7.10 can see and connect to all wifi networks in my house. But 8.04 cannot SEE any wifi networks...? Ubuntu Studio 8.04 seems to be missing gnome-network-manager entirely....What is going on with Hardy? I was told it was the STABLE SOLID release, but I had better luck with Gutsy, which was supposedly more "expiremental...."
[06:52] <mouseclone> B166erx: the sudo blkid I didn't know about.. but the sudo blkid will list all mount points with respected UUID
[06:52] <Jarryd> fuck. I made progress but Ubuntu is stuck at Loading linux kernal 100%
[06:52] <alien> maco: it works fine but still cant turn it into a ice cube lol
[06:52] <maco> Arelis: by "fantasy" do you just mean for the wallpaper?
[06:52] <bazhang> !language | Jarryd
[06:52] <ubotu> Jarryd: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
[06:52] <Arelis> ceil420: I am not a fan of the OS. I don't even like it. It does all kinds of weird things on my dad's laptop, and then he asks me. But i kind of like the look
[06:52] <maco> alien: oh in the settings manager you need to enable cube
[06:52] <brent113> maco: yes I understand that.  Unfortunately several themes I like are only made for emerald.  If there is a way of converting it to a different one I'd do that, but I have not yet found a way
[06:52] <alien> maco: cube i mean
[06:52] <Arelis> maco: GTK theme, usplash, everything
[06:52] <alien> maco: i dide that and reloaded
[06:52] <mouseclone> B166erz: vol_id /dev/sda1 will only like sda1 not all volumes
[06:52] <alien> maco: still nothing
[06:52] <nickrud> Myrtti you can still put it in xorg.conf I think.
[06:53] <maco> alien: did you enable cube rotate?
[06:53] <media64> can anyone help my res problem? i tried installing the restricted driver but it only made my problem worse
[06:53] <lopin> I'm having a problem with the upgrade tool locking up?
[06:53] <Myrtti> ok, let's try that
[06:53] <ceil420> Arelis, right down to the Vista "Start" button?
[06:53] <Gman99999> nickrud ok so with this command  passwd <password> in the command line in recovery mode will set everything in super user mode even if i reboot back into this account?
[06:53] <maco> Arelis: how do you do a fantasy gtk theme?
[06:53] <Arelis> ceil420: no, that thing's clusmy and unhandy to me
[06:53] <alien> maco: yes
[06:53] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/udev: 61: cannot create /dev/null: Permission denied  is this normal?
[06:53] <Arelis> maco: hmm..
[06:53] <maco> Arelis: gtk is just the colors of everything
[06:53] <Crshman> hey all, when i click "1" on my number pad on the keyboard linux logs me out...where can i change that?
[06:53] <EddieDied> I got a tonne of those
[06:53] <ekontsevoy> Hm... weird. I am doing sudo apt-get distupgrade on Gutsy (Slicehost) and nothing happens. Isn't it supposed to upgrade to Hardy?
[06:53] <bazhang> AdemoS: ubuntustudio is the problem; nothing to do with hardy and whatnot-->it is completely OSS so will not have certain drivers etc
[06:53] <ceil420> Arelis, then you're not looking for "exactly like Vista", and shouldn't have worded your request like that :p
[06:53] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: did you chroot into the temporary directory?
[06:53] <Arelis> maco: http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Everwood?content=61330 <-- This goes somewhat close
[06:53] <kunzy> bazhang:   I am going offline to test.   Asume no news is good news.   Thanks!!!!
[06:53] <Jarryd> kernal panic lol
[06:53] <s_> nor wired nor wireless internet connection in 8.04..dissapointment
[06:53] <nickrud> Gman99999 no, that means you can do   su - root in the terminal, and have access to the stuff you do in the recovery console
[06:54] <Gman99999> ok
[06:54] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: yes sudo chroot /media/disk su
[06:54] <amirman84> kpowersave anybody? or maybe somebody has suggestions for fixing my hibernation on my dell e1505 using hardy?
[06:54] <brent113> ekontsevoy, If you open update-manager and click the Check button, does it show you there is an upgrade available?
[06:54] <alien> maco:  any idea?
[06:54] <alien> maco: cube and rotate cube i enabled reloaded
[06:54] <ekontsevoy> brent113: I am on a comnand-line system
[06:54] <achandrashekar> media: im not sure if there is a backup file if you upgraded or not.. but may be checking /etc/X11 and the xorg.conf
[06:54] <alien> maco: everything still seems to be same
[06:54] <maco> Arelis: the wallpaper's the only thing fantasy about that...
[06:54] <s_> i returned to 7.10
[06:54] <Cynic_AU> hey guys, my 8.04 boots into BusyBox. Any tips for troubleshooting from here..?
[06:54] <maco> alien: hold down ctrl alt and click and drag your mouse...anything happen?
[06:54] <Jarryd> I am running a Live CD. How long is  a normal bootup time? core2 duo 1.8, 4gb ram
[06:54] <juan> hi I have a problem after updating to 8.04
[06:54] <ceil420> Cynic_AU, is that a window manager?
[06:54] <EddieDied> and I got this too /usr/sbin/mkinitramfs: 186: cannot create /dev/null: Permission denied
[06:54] <media64> okay ﻿achandrashekar: i have NO idea about anything in linux, i just installed it 10 minutes ago
[06:54] <alien> maco: lol yeah hehe
[06:55] <bazhang> AdemoS: the best way to go is to enable ubuntustudio repos then add stuff to ubuntu (apps, themes etc)
[06:55] <Crshman> any idea's as to what this error means?? (this is the error i get in /var/log/messages when i click "1") Xgl[13492]: segfault at 000001a6 eip 0818db66 esp bfdc81a0 error 4
[06:55] <Cynic_AU> BusyBox is a minimal shell with a few commands.
[06:55] <Gman99999> nickrud so i do  passwd <password> to get super user access in this account im logged into right now?
[06:55] <Cynic_AU> obviously something fails during startup
[06:55] <Tjh__> Eddie: run as root..
[06:55] <amirman84> :(
[06:55] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: cd /dev then run ./MAKEDEV /dev/null
[06:55] <EddieDied> BUT the file is there
[06:55] <Cynic_AU> gets halfway through startup splash
[06:55] <ceil420> Cynic_AU, ah. i don't know then. i was gonna suggest changing session at the login window <_<
[06:55] <EddieDied> oh ok
[06:55] <Cynic_AU> doesnt get to login window :) thanks anyway
[06:55] <brent113> ekontsevoy, the command to upgrade is sudo update-manager -d.  If that doesn't work.. I don't know
[06:55] <ceil420> i tried :x
[06:55] <crdlb> Crshman: get rid of Xgl
[06:55] <alien> maco: nice but it only shows two sides
[06:55] <B166erx> mouseclone http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64643/  (the 2 last lines) should that do the trick or am i missing something ?
[06:55] <nickrud> Gman99999 after you have enabled the root account in recovery mode, you do:    su - root   (switch user to root) , then type in the password. You are then in sudo mode, until you type exit
[06:56] <alien> maco: if i have 4 windows ..
[06:56] <EddieDied> ./MAKEDEV: don't know how to make device "/dev/null"
[06:56] <Jarryd> How long is a standard boot time?
[06:56] <Sp0tteh> can anyone help me out with mdadm?????
[06:56] <Cynic_AU> Jarryd - depends on hardware. For me - quicker than windows.
[06:56] <ceil420> Jarryd, there isn't a "standard" boot time
[06:56] <juan> After I updated from 7.10 to 8.04 and restart, I can't get the login window, my mouse is busy is there a solution??
[06:56] <achandrashekar> media64: that xorg.conf controls ALOT when dealing with X11 issues...and with the card you have, a google search, may just yield how to edit it properly. I highly suggest a backup of that file though, if you wish to "play with it".In the worse case scenario, you can revert it. do that with a cp xorg.conf to xorg.conf.old.
[06:56] <B166erx> mouseclone (just saw the relatime error, fixed)
[06:56] <maxagaz> how to copy all and only the hidden files and directories of my home/ directory ?
[06:56] <Crshman> crdlb: will compiz still work w/o XGL?
[06:56] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: what about ./MAKEDEV std?
[06:56] <nickrud> Gman99999 the reason you're doing this is you can't read /etc/sudoers except with root privs, either from sudo or from logging in as root
[06:57] <crdlb> Crshman: you might need to make a few changes, but yes it should
[06:57] <media64> where do i find that file?
[06:57] <maxagaz> to another location
[06:57] <maco> alien: in the setting thing, change your horizontal virtual size to 4...in general section
[06:57] <mouseclone> B166erx: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64644/
[06:57] <Crshman> crdlb: cool thanks
[06:57] <bazhang> media64: this is gutsy or hardy
[06:57] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: ./MAKEDEV: warning: can't read /proc/devices
[06:57] <achandrashekar> mxagaz: thats done with a cp -r for a recursive copy and * as a wildcard
[06:57] <Jarryd> Then does that mean that if i am Jammed on "Loading Linux Kernal 100%" for 5 minutes on a live cd, it is jammed?
[06:57] <mouseclone> B166erx: corrected
[06:57] <Dusk_> hi there
[06:57] <Gman99999> nickrud sorry im just a little confused here how do i enable root access in recovery mode again?
[06:57] <crdlb> Crshman: join #compiz-fusion if compiz doesn't work without Xgl installed
[06:57] <AdemoS> So, 7.10 can see and connect to all wifi networks in my house. But 8.04 cannot SEE any wifi networks...? Ubuntu Studio 8.04 seems to be missing gnome-network-manager entirely....What is going on with Hardy? I was told it was the STABLE SOLID release, but I had better luck with Gutsy, which was supposedly more "expiremental...."
[06:57] <nickrud> m1dn1ght what chips set do you have again?
[06:57] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: try running mount -t proc proc /proc
[06:57] <alien> maco: ok
[06:58] <m1dn1ght> sorry nickrud - missed that last message.  Was an SiS Mirage 3.
[06:58] <bazhang> AdemoS: I just gave you two answers why are you repeating?
[06:58] <JewRat> alien
[06:58] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: then run your previous commands?
[06:58] <alien> JewRat: yes sir
[06:58] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: yes
[06:58] <Gman99999> nickrud so i do su-root in recovery mode as well, im just a tad confused on this part
[06:58] <AdemoS> bazhang, sorry didn't see before
=== paijo is now known as punk
[06:58] <bazhang> AdemoS: scroll up to see
[06:58] <nickrud> Gman99999 when you see the command prompt, just type    passwd <rootpassword>
[06:58] <shulman> I just upgraded to Hardy and am attempting to use Ubuntu with the nvidia driver-- I'm able to use both screens, but gnome seems to be treating both screens as seperate entities -- I can move the mouse between them but I can't move windows between them. Any idea how I can fix this?
[06:58] <nickrud> Gman99999 not needed, you're already root in recovery :)
[06:58] <m1dn1ght> messages don't stay on the screen long when you're in 800x600!  :D
[06:58] <Radtoo^laptop> AdemoS: Take it easy... read the answers... breathe deeply... and be a bit tolerant, this is complex stuff :)
[06:58] <AdemoS> bazhang, I tried both Ubuntu Studio and Ubuntu desktop, same exact issue
[06:58] <Eleaf> Is it possible to give pulseaudio a higher priority?  It skips so much when doing processor-intensive things or just doing lots of scrolling (while alsa won't skip alone)...?
[06:58] <media64> i have a 7900 nVidia graphics card, i dont know too much about it other than it has 1 Gb of vram
[06:58] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: ok ./MAKEDEV std came to a new line
[06:58] <nickrud> m1dn1ght the chip numbers, 761/771 ? was that right?
[06:58] <achandrashekar> anyone experiencing strange acpi issues...when plugging in power to a laptop on boot? my systems ocassionally hangs and complains of it.
[06:59] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: when I did the /dev/null one, I still get ./MAKEDEV: don't know how to make device "/dev/null"
[06:59] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: does /dev/null exist?
[06:59] <Dusk_> i had a log in problem in ubuntu and it was an error about network-manager so i apt-get removed network-manager and network-manager-gnome. now i can log in but there is no internet connection. how can i reinstall netwok manager aain??
[06:59] <Jarryd> Why is bootup screen JAMMED at 100%?!?!?
[06:59] <m1dn1ght> If I gave you that info nick, I would need to have been guided to it.  Not sure how to tell sorry!
[06:59] <AdemoS> bazhang, while my wireless modem is detected, all wifi networks have disapeared. if I pop in a 7.10 live cd, all my wifi network are back....?
[06:59] <juan> After updating from 7.10 to 8.04 and restarting, I can't get the login window, my mouse looks busy but it doesnt load, How can I fix that???
[06:59] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: yes
[06:59] <alien> maco: grr no cube :(
[06:59] <Gman99999> ok so i reboot go into recovery mode and then type in that passwd <rootpassword> and then i reboot and then come back in this account?
[06:59] <nickrud> m1dn1ght   lspci | grep -i  vga
[06:59] <alien> maco: trying but cant find those settings iether
[06:59] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: now try running update-initramfs
[06:59] <EddieDied> k
[06:59] <Gman99999> nickrud ok so i reboot go into recovery mode and then type in that passwd <rootpassword> and then i reboot and then come back in this account?
