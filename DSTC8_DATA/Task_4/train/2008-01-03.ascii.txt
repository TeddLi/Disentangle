[14:34] <jaggz-> no
[14:34] <perfector> v3ctor: CyberMatt i tried it multiple times.. it does not remove any links anymore but still tries to startup during boot-time
[14:34] <jaggz-> wrong
[14:34] <zOOd> 'lo tous.
[14:34] <Invert314> that command worked fine
[14:34] <doxie> hate you all. :>
[14:34] <jaggz-> that's not really gzipped
[14:34] <x-X-x> i want to access a dir but i cant and when i check properties under permissions it says the "owner is 1445" and the group is "300" can someone help me ?
[14:34] <perfector> v3ctor: CyberMatt any other way i can remove it.. like config files?
[14:34] <chef_> ty all... think I got it now... just hope I remember all this for next time... gonna try to jot it all down quick b4 I forget everything I just learned
[14:34] <Omer> arang2: i'll give you an update in a few minutes, i'm connected through wireless
[14:34] <[SpigiBoy]> hello
[14:34] <arang2> Omer: alright muchas gracias
[14:35] <v3ctor> perfector: check all of the /etc/rcX.d directories
[14:35] <jaggz-> v3ctor: your command was wrong, why don;t you speak up??  :)
[14:35] <Coope> Does 7.10's encryption at install encrypt swap?
[14:35] <gsnsr> my wireless card is broadcom, ubuntu recognize it, I see wireless connection in network setting, but I can't turn it on. I pushed the wireless button. It ran normally in windows, can u help me?

[14:36] <Invert314> jaggz-, using  tar -czf doxwz.tar.gz dox/ (your command) resulted in a tar ball half the size compared with the tar ball the other comand created
[14:36] <Invert314> we hate you too doxie
[14:36] <v3ctor> perfector: like /etc/rc2.d /etc/rc3.d etc
[14:36] <tifine> whats the command to display the processor speed and other things ?
[14:37] <v3ctor> perfector: shouldn't start then
[14:37] <jaggz-> Invert314: your command looks, to you, like it worked, but it didn't.  You can call the output file anything you want, but with -z it will be gzipped, and without it it will not
[14:37] <perfector> v3ctor: yeah and rcS too
[14:37] <perfector> v3ctor: i also used to think the same.. this is baffling me
[14:37] <jaggz-> tar -cf foo.tar dir/             tar -czf foo.tar.gz dir/
[14:38] <_mug> hey im trying out nvidia-settings and i wonder how i make it save the settings.. i apllied "cursor-shadow" but nothing happens, after a x-restart the box is unchecked and every change i made is back as it was..
[14:38] <jaggz-> tar -cf foo.tar.gz dir/     <--- this makes a normal uncompressed tar file, but it mistakenly calls it .gz
[14:38] <jaggz-> I think we used to have to do compression like this:   tar -cf - dir/  |  gzip -c  > file.tar.gz       :)
[14:39] <Dr_willis> now is the time to google for a tar tutorial or 4 :)
[14:39] <jaggz-> we still have to with unsupported compression
[14:39] <v3ctor> lol @ Dr_willis
[14:39] <chef_> ok... 1 more question guys... would this be the installation path of my browser (default 7.10) /usr/firefox?
[14:39] <jaggz-> v3ctor: why are you laughing?  you're the one who needs to read it.. ;)
[14:39]  * jaggz- nudges v3ctor
[14:39] <jaggz-> :)
[14:40] <Dr_willis> _mug,  i normally edit/enable some of that stuff by manually eding the xorg.conf I wonder if compiz overrides/disables some of those settings..
[14:40] <v3ctor> jaggz-: i accidentally copied and pasted someone eleses mess up...oops
[14:40] <Dr_willis> _mug,  i THINK cursor shadow only works with the default X cursors.. not the fancier gnome/compiz ones
[14:40] <_mug> Dr_willis: hmrm
[14:40] <Dr_willis> I toyed witht he shadow ages ago. Not messed with it lately.

[14:42] <jaggz-> definitely.. if you have the time
[14:42] <jaggz-> comp, /quit ?
[14:42] <jaggz-> Why does my package system say:  ii  python2.4      2.4.1-0-1      Python 2.4   but software with dependencies are broken, requiring python2.4 (>= 2.3.90) (UNSATISFIED)  ?
[14:43] <jaggz-> it was through my own fiddling with the system trying to get some software installed which required some python dev tools, but my distro is old and unsupported (and I needed this development to get some important work done -- so I couldn't update my distro)
=== chaky_ is now known as chaky
[14:43] <jaggz-> so I manually/force installed some python packages, and those overwrote my existing python2.4 stuff, and now tons of things are broken :(
[14:44] <jaggz-> I'd like to tell the system, "convince yourself that my current python2.4 is sufficient"
[14:44] <v3ctor> do you have more than one python version installed?
[14:45] <timrit> Does anyone know why my number pad on my keyboard would stop working on its own and the only way to get it back is to restart the machine? Also, if I restart X by <cntl - alt - bksp> I get a login screen but after I log in i never get my desktop.
[14:45] <chef_> Dr_willis: sorry 2 keep bothering you but you seem quite knowledgable... installer is asking for the installation path of my browser giving this ex. (i.e., /usr/lib/mozilla)... that file doesn't exist but there is a /usr/firefox file... I'm guessing that's the correct one but would like confirmation so I not sticking files any old place & wondering why the app doesn't work
[14:45] <jaggz-> yes and no.. there's the older python 2.3 also installed.. and it all worked before with 2.3 and 2.4.. it wasn't until I had to install some -dev packages which were of mismatched versions
[14:46] <jaggz-> that I overwrote my 2.4 python and broke everything
[14:46] <iblicf> hi , i have installed the pulseaudio using apt-get from the reportery , 7.10 , allmost everything can found there, bu i dont's know how to use  it , and seems sth wrong like i can't stop the bell ring of vi / terminal ?
[14:46] <v3ctor> jaggz-: i had the original problem you had before, it was because of the symlink to of python to the wrong binary...it pointed to 2.4 instead of 2.5
[14:47] <mrtimdog> Anyone know of a resource booking app for ubuntu?
[14:47] <jaggz-> I'd like to tell it, "consider my current python2.4 is sufficient to satisfy python2.4 v2.3.90"
[14:47] <Dr_willis> chef_,  you do realize theres an updated .deb package that can install the new flash player? :) you wouldent have to mess with this stuff.
[14:47] <poningru_> Martinp23, resource booking?
[14:47] <poningru_> err
[14:47] <poningru_> mrtimdog,
[14:47] <v3ctor> jaggz-: what does `python --version` tell you
[14:48] <x-X-x> im trying to access a directory and it says i dont have the permission too and when i check the properties of that dir it says that the owner of the dir is "1445" and that the group is "300" what does this mean? isnt it supposed to say root ? can someone help me ?
[14:48] <mrtimdog> poningru_: Just general resources, i.e. meeting rooms, projectors, etc..

[14:48] <chef_> Dr-willis: no I had no idea but then again I want to learn this so I don't have to shell out the big $$$ to Uncle Bill for crappy software
[14:48] <v3ctor> jaggz-: i like the extra keystrokes...its the only exercise i get ;)
[14:48] <jaggz-> I think I downloaded and installed a bunch of python's from the ubuntu old-releases.ubuntu.com repository

[14:48] <ubotu> To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash - Flash 9 is now available in dapper-backports and edgy-backports - See also !Restricted and !Gnash
[14:48] <jaggz-> lol
[14:48] <ubotu> The Flash plugin installation is currently broken. This is due to Adobe changing the tar file that the package downloads. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=636397 if you need to fix this immediately, but it's recommended to wait for an official fix.
[14:49] <Dr_willis> chef_,  that 2nd url the bot posted - has info/links to the 'testing' flash installer package. Use at your own risk. :) but i imagine its safer then using the flash installer.
[14:49] <v3ctor> jaggz-: have you tried removing all python packages and starting over?
[14:50] <jaggz-> hmm.. perhaps I could force-install the current one, over the existing one, with an option saying it satisfies the other dependencies?
[14:50] <v3ctor> you could...
[14:50] <jaggz-> I'm a bit hesitant to remove them since I have it working
[14:50] <Nicolaidis> hello, does someone use weather desklet?

[14:52] <copperhead> i'm new to ubuntu but a long time slackware user.  this system has a wide screen lcd that wants the display at 1440x900@60Hz.  This wasn't an option in the System->Administration->Screens and Graphics interface, so I extracted the .INF file from the windows 'driver' for that monitor and imported it.  Now Screens and Graphics offers the monitor as a choice, but the screen gets set to...
[14:52] <jaggz-> dpkg --convince-yourself-and-remember-that-all-dependencies-are-satisfied
[14:52] <copperhead> ...1280x1024 after I restart.  /etc/X11/xorg.conf shows 1440x900.  Does anybody know what script is changing the resoloution after X starts?

[14:53] <Dr_willis> bobbo,  its one of those neat things.. that i wish would get really really really common really really fast!
[14:53] <Dr_willis> :)
[14:53] <osfameron> how do I create a new keyboard shortcut in gnome?  e.g. to launch an executable
[14:54] <bobbo> Dr_willis: My mobo doesnt have any Sata connectors, if i get an eSata PCI card will this be enough to connect my eSata HD?
[14:55] <AdemoS> whoever it was that recommended Deluge over Azu.....appears to be right
[14:55] <jaggz-> I have to sleep :(

[14:59] <wols> howlingmadhowie: unless she changed kernels then, very much sounds like hardware. does the BIOS still recognize the drive?
[14:59] <Gpalco> c9s, I MANAGED to set alias!

[15:00] <howlingmadhowie> wols: an excellent question. with the stupid bios, i suppose she'll have to start new and check.

[15:16] <Vixen_> I'm trying to install Ubuntu on an external HD, I can't repartition the drive as it says it is "mounted". Can someone explain this, and how to fix it so I can repartition and install ubuntu with out damaging my internal HDs at all?

[15:17] <pike_> Yodude: hide
[15:17] <bobbyd> Vixen_: right-click the external drive and select "unmount"
[15:17] <ubuntu> is it possible?
[15:17] <wols> mounted drives are the ones you can access Vixen_
[15:17] <elde1> Yodude: buy a new one. lol
[15:17] <Yodude> elde1: no really is it fixable ?
[15:17] <wols> ubuntu: no
[15:17] <elde1> Yodude: well what happend?
[15:17] <bobbyd> wols: need to unmount the drive to repartition
[15:17] <ubuntu> wols: thanks
[15:17] <Vixen_> bobbyd, wols: I'll then be able to repartition?
[15:17] <wols> Yodude: you shouldn't be able to kill it that way. and it will never show up in lspci
[15:18] <Omer_> ampex: try 7-zip, you can just apt-get or dl it from 7-zip.org

[15:19] <Vixen_> wols: cheers, will I then be able to partition it into separate drives for linux and windows?

[15:24] <pike_> Yodude: i have trouble with usb and my main box. if you have a lappy or something you might try in in another machine also
[15:24] <Yodude> wols: the problem is that i don't have the usb with me anymore
[15:24] <bakarat> hi, for some reason when i try to write something to an usb stick, it will first cache whatever i want to do, and only once i unmount it, will it start writing, this is _very_ annoying
[15:24] <bakarat> what is the reasoning behind this and how can i stop it?
[15:25] <YouKnowMe> I'm trying to ssh into my chumby, which doesn't have a password, but I keep getting asked for one. I'm hoping this is a prob with my ssh client. Help?
[15:25] <wols> bakarat: mount it synced
[15:25] <Dr_willis> bakarat,  speed,  is the reason.
[15:25] <Yodude> pike_: it's not working on any computer i plug it into, wether it was Linux/Mac/Windows
[15:25] <bakarat> wols: it automounts, how can i change this?
[15:25] <wols> Yodude: what OS does this chumby run?
[15:25] <Dr_willis> actually ive sene windows do similer things.  :)
[15:25] <bakarat> Dr_willis: could you explain?
[15:25] <Vlet> YouKnowMe: your chumby?
[15:25] <bobbyd> bakarat: the reasoning is that it extends the life of your flash device because if you decide to write wiles and move them around, then delete them etc. you're shortening the life of your device
[15:25] <Dr_willis> bakarat,  it caches the writes so it can do them all at once in one big write = more efficient.
[15:25] <bakarat> Vlet: a rather useless but populair device :)
[15:26] <pike_> Yodude: i have to go sorry. screencast time. good luck
[15:26] <Vlet> bakarat: ahh :)
[15:26] <YouKnowMe> vlet, small networked computer
[15:26] <Yodude> wols: doesn't matter, i testted and it doesn't work on XP and Vista and Ubuntu
[15:26] <bobbyd> bakarat: what's the problem you have with it?
[15:26] <Dr_willis> bakarat,  also watch out for .Trash type directories getting made when you delete things.
[15:26] <poningru_> whochismo, ah ok here we go thats a rv380
[15:26] <whochismo> i tried to uninstall the restricted drivers (to see if gnome automatically used the free ones) but that was not the case
[15:26] <poningru_> need to do research
[15:26] <Yodude> pike_: thanks for the help anyway
[15:26] <poningru_> hold on
[15:26] <bobbyd> bakarat: you can force it to write the data by giving it "sync" from the command line
[15:26] <Vlet> YouKnowMe: what client are you using?
[15:26] <Yodude> so anybody has any ideas ?
[15:26] <bakarat> bobbyd: well for one, it takes a longer time then you would expect (since it only starts once you want to stop) and the latter has seemingly broken a flash drive of my m8
[15:27] <bakarat> bobbyd: another mate pulled it out after unmounting, but it was only then starting to write

[15:27] <Dr_willis> bakarat,  ive done similer things under windows also. :)
[15:27] <xalanthyr__> Hi, I've got a problem - every time I log in i get the same message - "user's $HOME/.dmrc is being ignored". What's wrong?
[15:27] <whochismo> poningru, sorry, what do you mean with "r380" is it the version of the driver?
[15:27] <bobbyd> bakarat: I'm pretty sure windows does the same when you "safely remove hardware" no?
[15:27] <Vlet> YouKnowMe: then I would guess that it's the chumby asking for a password
[15:28] <bakarat> bobbyd: i doubt it a bit, since i've always been able to pull it out immediatly in windows, whereas in linux if you have a big file waiting, it will take a long while
[15:28] <Dr_willis> windows and its 'safely remove hardware' right now - tells me i can remove my internal SATA drive.. still not sure how. :P
[15:28] <Yodude> elde1: so is it doomed or what ?

[15:29] <Dr_willis> You are NOT supposed to idmentaly pull it out on windows either. :)
[15:29] <Gpalco> I cannot believe Ubuntu doesn't have the "alternative configuration" feature in network setup like in Windows!
[15:29] <YouKnowMe> vlet, hmm, it shouldn't be. I followed the wiki and supposedly if I log into it as root there's no password.. well that sucks..

[15:30] <bakarat> Dr_willis: bobbyd is there a way to change a setting or something so it is automounted as synced?
[15:30] <DSpair> Gpalco: It's just different. It does the same thing, but the UI is different.
[15:30] <Yodude> wols: so do you think it's totally dead ? or is there hope for it ?
[15:30] <poningru_> whochismo, x600 is just the marketing term of the card
[15:30] <Vlet> YouKnowMe: Perhaps they mean "the password is blank". I doubt it will simply not ask for one.
[15:30] <whochismo> poningru, my intention is to install the free driver (in order to be able to login again), and then to use the restricted driver again
[15:30] <whochismo> oh, ok
[15:30] <whochismo> thnx
[15:31] <whochismo> i'll have a look
[15:31] <poningru_> whochismo, why do you want to use the restricted  driver?

[15:55] <Jack_Sparrow> Tetracomm:  try using   /msg ubotu vmware
[15:55] <Tetracomm> Sorry.
[15:57] <Jack_Sparrow> Tetracomm: Dont worry about it too much...  I do it too often myself...
[15:58] <idyllic> Pici, i just tried it. Got this error msg: "The greeter application appears to be crashing. Attempting to use a different one"
[15:58] <idyllic> and I couldnt get the session loggin screen, have to force restart also
[15:59] <Pici> idyllic: hrm, I didnt think it would do that.
[15:59] <Pici> idyllic: Do you dualboot?
[15:59] <kurumin> chanecs
[15:59] <idyllic> ya, i dualboot with xp

[15:59] <jdh6403> how do you install real player in ubuntu
[16:00] <bart> affff
[16:00] <bart> awe
[16:00] <Tetracomm> :)
[16:00] <bart> br?
[16:00] <idyllic> ctrl-alt-backspace just restart my comp normally. So ya, first thing come is the grub bootloader
[16:01] <Pici> idyllic: Are you sure that you are pressing backspace and not delete?
[16:01] <imoska> idyllic: open your xorg.conf
[16:01] <jdh6403> how do you install realplayer?
[16:01] <whochismo> poningru, it didn't work
[16:01] <Pici> !real > jdh6403 (Please see the private messsage from ubotu)
[16:01] <idyllic> ya i m positively sure about that. Xorg.conf opened
[16:02] <imoska> show me your ServerFlags section
[16:02] <coldboot> How do I close NFS connections in the CLOSE_WAIT state when listed by `netstat -d`?
[16:02] <whochismo> I tried some similar things before, but it doesn't works, gnome is unable to start except in failsave mode
[16:02] <ChrisAshton84> are there x86 compatibility libs for x86_64 ubuntu?  I specifically need libtcl8.3.so
[16:02] <idyllic> i don't have ServerFlags section
[16:03] <loa> <coldboot> susctl
[16:04] <Xintruder> can i install ubuntu in my current vista laptop, if i dont have a partition available and want to convert my files to? :D
[16:04] <loa> it is not problem of NFS
[16:04] <Xintruder> <lazy butt
[16:04] <coldboot> loa: What is susctl?
[16:04] <loa> sysctl
[16:04] <ikonia> coldboot: he means sysctl
[16:04] <loa> yes
[16:04] <ikonia> Xintruder: no you can't do that
[16:05] <coldboot> So let's say I have this: "tcp       45      0 nhooey-xeon.ne.ende:nfs 172.30.62.57:51494      CLOSE_WAIT"
[16:05] <coldboot> How do I get rid of it with sysctl?
[16:05] <whochismo> anyone know a way to reinstall all the video drivers for ATI?
[16:05] <coldboot> whochismo: The proprietary drivers?
[16:05] <ikonia> whochismo: why do you want to re-install ?
[16:05] <coldboot> Probably because they're shitty and broken, as they always have been, and the acceleration never turns on.

[16:05] <ubotu> coldboot: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
[16:05] <whochismo> coldboot, or the free ones, i don't mind, i just want to be able to start gnome
[16:06] <imoska> idyllic: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-495877.html
[16:06] <whochismo> ikonia, to solve one issue, i reinstalled the restricted drivers, and now i'm not able to start gnome
[16:06] <coldboot> Is there seriously anyone else in here but men from the ages of 16 to 50?
[16:06] <ikonia> whochismo: so how will re-installing them again fix it
[16:06] <coldboot> I don't see why the channel has to be "family friendly" in the puritan sense.
[16:06] <whochismo> ikonia, i have tryed that many times
[16:07] <valemon> in which repo can I find java runtime environment?
[16:07] <Jack_Sparrow> coldboot: Please behave
[16:07] <whochismo> i've reinstalled the restricted ones and then the free ones, and none worked
[16:07] <ikonia> coldboot: thats an offtopic disussion, the rules are "family friendly"
[16:07] <coldboot> whochismo: Why is gnome not starting?
[16:07] <idyllic> ikonia: thanks, let me digest it first. Will get back as soon as i can
[16:07] <ikonia> whochismo you don't install the free ones, they are already part of xorg
[16:07] <coldboot> Swearing makes the language colourful.
[16:07] <whochismo> coldboot, it happened when i reinstalled the drivers, i don't know why
[16:07] <cronik> helle everyone and happy new years
[16:07] <coldboot> It's hard to describe ATI's Linux drivers without saying bad words.
[16:07] <ikonia> coldboot: please stop, this is not appropriate for a support channel
[16:07] <cronik> yea coldboot
[16:07] <whochismo> i mean, first i had the restricted drivers installed, with no problems
[16:07] <coldboot> whochismo: Yes but what's the error?
[16:08] <ikonia> whochismo: , so you have the restricted drivers with no problems
[16:08] <whochismo> coldboot, once i put my username and password, it won't load gnome, and takes me back the login screen
[16:08] <coldboot> whochismo: You need to tell us some sort of error from /var/log/Xorg.0.log or something.
[16:08] <ChrisAshton84> hi is there a channel specifically for x86_64 support or anyone who knows where to go for support online?
[16:08] <loa> <coldboot> yes yes... wait i give you a link
[16:08] <ikonia> whochismo: that may not be a driver issue
[16:08] <whochismo> i had the restricted, i tried to update them, and then everything started to fail
[16:08] <cronik> whochismo:
[16:08] <ikonia> whochismo: that could be no disk space, or permission to write to your home dir
[16:08] <whochismo> i tryed to uninstall them and install the free ones, but now gnome doesn't start
[16:08] <ikonia> whochismo: why did you try to update them
[16:08] <cronik> did you ever manage to get in or configure the the username and password?
[16:08]  * loa slap coldboot with your mum (CLEAN YOUR ROOM!).
[16:09] <ikonia> whochismo: what free ones, the restricted ones are the ones from ati.com
[16:09] <loa> ./usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt
[16:09] <coldboot> whochismo: Try to change the driver to vesa by editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf, just by changing the Driver "fglrx" to Driver "vesa", and try again
[16:09] <whochismo> i updated them, because there was an issue regarding the ability to hibernate my computer
[16:09] <whochismo> to vesa? let me try
[16:09] <coldboot> whochismo: Trying vesa will narrow the problem.
[16:09] <idyllic> ikonia: it doesnt work. And i am on 7.10
[16:09] <cronik> hello
[16:09] <coldboot> whochismo: Vesa is the most likely to always work
[16:09] <whochismo> yes, but
[16:09] <ikonia> idyllic: what was the question sorry
[16:09] <whochismo> don't you think it's rare
[16:09] <coldboot> So anyone know how to knock out a CLOSE_WAIT connection with sysctl?
[16:09] <cronik> cco
[16:09] <whochismo> that it works perfectly in failsave mode
[16:10] <ikonia> coldboot: sysctl won't do that
[16:10] <whochismo> and if i choose the normal session, it won't start?
[16:10] <coldboot> ikonia: Well someone else said that...
[16:10] <coldboot> ikonia: How can I get rid of it?
[16:10] <idyllic> my Ctrl-Alt-Backspace reboots my comp, but not restart X
[16:10] <ikonia> coldboot: I do'nt see how it could do that
[16:10] <whochismo> ok, i'll try that and i'll come back
[16:10] <poningru_> whochismo, do you have the restricted stuff uninstalled?
[16:10] <whochismo> see you (and thnx)
[16:10] <ikonia> coldboot: what is the process making that close wait ?
[16:10] <coldboot> ikonia: I killed some process on my machine "xeon" which has nfs-kernel-server running.
[16:10] <whochismo> poningru_, yes, i've nothing installed now
[16:10] <whochismo> (well, I have the free drivers installed, but they don't work)
[16:10] <coldboot> ikonia: Now any attempt to mount a drive that's on xeon, from "inspiron", results in a timeout.
[16:10] <ikonia> coldboot: where any clients connected ?
[16:11] <whochismo> (or only work in failsave)
[16:11] <poningru_> whochismo, just do a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver-core
[16:11] <ikonia> coldboot: if you have killed the NFS server, it will time out
[16:11] <poningru_> or something like that
[16:11] <poningru_> I forgot the exact command
[16:11] <whochismo> i think i did some days ago...
[16:11] <coldboot> ikonia: No clients are connected now, I suspect all these close_waits are from me not unmounting nfs volumes before shutting down my laptop.
[16:11] <v3ctor> coldboot: yes it is
[16:11] <ikonia> coldboot: that is a reasonable assumption
[16:11] <whochismo> it lets me select again the screen resolution, driver, frequency, etc etc... but that doesn't solve anything
[16:11] <siakattackj> I have a laptop toshiba A210 with soundcard ATI SB600 azalia but i don't have sound...any help?
[16:12] <jdh6403> trying to play a dvd in gxine and this error message comes up   what do i need to do?    No demuxer found - stream format not recognised.
[16:12] <whochismo> isn't there a place where the error messages regarding the X11 are shown?
[16:12] <Pici> !dvd > jdh6403 (Please see the private messsage from ubotu)
[16:12] <coldboot> ikonia: v3ctor: But that's not really a problem, 'cause I've shutdown my laptop so many times without unmounting the nfs volumes. It started timing out after I killed a process on the machine with the nfs volumes: "xeon"...
[16:12] <v3ctor> coldboot: is the NFS share still showing as mounted on the client?
[16:12] <poningru_> whochismo, do that again
[16:12] <coldboot> ikonia: v3ctor: Do you know how I could recover from this without rebooting xeon?
[16:12] <whochismo> i would like to see what really happens when i start session and x11 restarts itself..
[16:12] <Pici> whochismo: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[16:12] <poningru_> and this time dont do the -plow
[16:12] <kakashi> I have a problem configuring my network please help
[16:12] <whochismo> ok, let me see
[16:12] <poningru_> let it autodetect
[16:13] <coldboot> v3ctor: Nope, "mount" shows nothing to do with nfs on the client machine: "inspiron"
[16:13] <Bollinger> i've got a box which is seeing (random) access violations in dmsg, I've run a memory tester for a while with no errors detected. Is there another tool I could run which would detect flaky hardware?
[16:13] <hades[nb]> m
[16:13] <poningru_> Bollinger, stress
[16:13] <Pici> coldboot: The connections will timeout a dissapear on their own.
[16:13] <coldboot> Pici: They've been there for a day
[16:13] <kakashi> ikonia: can you please help me
[16:13] <poningru_> kakashi, whatsup?
[16:13] <Bollinger> poningru_: Thanks . I'll look into it.
[16:14] <whochismo> too much things on the log, i'll try to reconfigure the X11 again..
[16:14] <loa> <coldboot> /usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt
[16:14] <v3ctor> coldboot: is the close_wait showing on the client or the server?
[16:14] <loa> there you can find how to decrease this time out
[16:14] <coldboot> loa: You've already told me about sysctl, could you tell me how it's used to knock out close_wait connections?
[16:14] <coldboot> v3ctor: Several on the server, all the old IP addresses of inspiron each time it connected to the network.
[16:15] <coldboot> v3ctor: But this is probably not the problem, I killed a process on the server, and now I time out when mounting NFS.
[16:15] <kakashi> poningru: ah!! thanks
[16:15] <v3ctor> coldboot: restart the process that you killed
[16:15] <Roshev> ##level
[16:15] <kakashi> poningru: it worked ;-D
[16:15] <scott_> Helllo World.
[16:15] <coldboot> v3ctor: Do you know how to restart NFS completely, 'cause /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart, and restarting nfs-common, both do nothing to help.
[16:15] <coldboot> v3ctor: I don't remember which process it was.
[16:16] <free_loader> is it possible to change the icons in Gutsy without changing the entire theme?

[16:16] <JC_Denton_> I'm formatting a usb disk. How do I change the FS to vfat16 ?
[16:17] <cgs_bob> hello all.  is there an easy way to list the dependencies of a particular program?
[16:17] <poningru_> JC_Denton_, how are you formating it?
[16:17] <poningru_> what are you using to format?
=== neversfelde_ is now known as neversfelde
[16:17] <shaft0> If I do a software RAID0 (or Linear) setup in Gutsy, and I want to add drives to that array in the future, will the added drives have to be the same size?  Like can I start it out with 2x500, then add a 300, or a 750, or 1000?
[16:17] <JC_Denton_> Not bothered - any util though fdisk is fine
[16:17] <coldboot> Chui: How long should this command take to return?
[16:17] <hades[nb]> cgs_bob, aptitude show <package_name>
[16:18] <Chui> coldboot: immediately ;-)
[16:18] <poningru_> shaft0, any partition of that size will do
[16:18] <poningru_> the 500gb
[16:18] <ikonia> shaft0 raid0 is a bad idea more so to use dynamiclly
[16:18] <loa> <coldboot> sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 10
[16:18] <ikonia> shaft0: what reason do you want raid0 ?
[16:18] <Muppet-Boy> hiya, my kubuntu 7.10 system has started freezing for no reason :( is there a log i can check that might give a clue as to why?
[16:19] <cgs_bob> hades[nb]: I was looking for a command line, but I will try aptitude show...thanks!
[16:19] <ikonia> Muppet-Boy: syslog, messages ?
[16:19] <coldboot> Chui: Still timing out, didn't help at all.
[16:19] <coldboot> Chui: I suspect the same happens when you restart nfs-kernel-server.
[16:19] <poningru_> JC_Denton_, I would do fdisk and do m
[16:19] <JC_Denton_> poningru will fdisk write a single partition as vfat?
[16:19] <poningru_> it should have ability to change it to vfat
[16:19] <JC_Denton_> poningru thanks
[16:19] <poningru_> JC_Denton_, yeah
[16:19] <Chui> coldboot: is portmapper running ?
[16:19] <Muppet-Boy> ikonia : do you mean syslog.log?
[16:19] <coldboot> loa: That command says it's malformed, you can't space out the '=' symbol
[16:19] <hades[nb]> cgs_bob, don't quite understand... you need a console command, right?
[16:19] <ikonia> Muppet-Boy: ye,
[16:19] <poningru_> JC_Denton_, you have to do mkfs.vfat afterward though
[16:20] <ikonia> yes
[16:20] <shaft0> ikonia: basically i have drives of music, video, and software, i like the idea of using free space of one drive for another, while still keeping it sorted
[16:20] <loa> <coldboot> sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=10
[16:20] <coldboot> Chui: Yes and it's been restarted which didn't help either.
[16:20] <ikonia> shaft0: then look at lvm
[16:20] <loa> this command fixes long timeout
[16:20] <ikonia> shaft0: rather than raid0
[16:20] <shaft0> linear?
[16:20] <loa> it will be 10 seconds
[16:20] <coldboot> loa: Is this going to apply to old close_wait connections, or only new ones formed?
[16:20] <Muppet-Boy> ok thanks i will check as soon as i can get to it! (its just gone offline again :( )
[16:20] <Roshev> ##level
[16:20] <Chui> coldboot: what is your prob anyway ? ;-) too lazy to scroll up
[16:20] <loa> <coldboot> i think to all
[16:20] <ikonia> shaft0: what do you mean by linear ?
[16:20] <cgs_bob> hades[nb]: that's right.  in particular I want to see what programs depend on sip4
[16:20] <loa> tyr this
[16:20] <loa> try
[16:20] <shaft0> ikonia: is that the one that fills one drive, moves on to the next, then fills that drive, then moves to the next, and so on?
[16:21] <coldboot> loa: Is that 10 minutes or seconds?
[16:21] <ikonia> shaft0: you can set up the volume as you want
[16:21] <loa> i think you can try ifdown
[16:21] <coldboot> Chui: I killed some process on my server, xeon, which exports some directory as nfs.
[16:21] <loa> 10 seconds
[16:21] <coldboot> Chui: Ever since I did that, I time out when trying to mount the nfs volume from the client.
[16:21] <ikonia> coldboot: it would help if you stopped saying the server name as the name is quite confusing
[16:21] <timrit> Hello, Does anyone know why every time I log in after a restart or logout that it asks me if I want to use X settings or Gnome settings?
[16:21] <v3ctor> coldboot: did you kill that process for a reason?
[16:21] <hades[nb]> cgs_bob, you mean list programs that depend on the given one, or list programs, that the given one depends on?
[16:21] <coldboot> Chui: Restarting nfs-kernel-server, nfs-common, portmap, and doing the sysctl and your export -rav have all not helped at all.
[16:22] <coldboot> v3ctor: I thought it would help get rid of the stale connection, it was obviously a mistake.
[16:22] <Chui> coldboot: exportfs -uav ; and stop nfs-kernel server
[16:22] <JC_Denton_> poningru mkfs.vfat: Will not try to make filesystem on full-disk device '/dev/sdb' (use -I if wanted) ?
[16:22] <hades[nb]> cgs_bob, the aptitude show displays all information on the given package, including packages it depends upon
[16:23] <coldboot> Chui: Stop it first or after exportfs?

[16:23] <coldboot> Chui: Then what?
[16:23] <ikonia> pocketprotector: why ?
[16:23] <coldboot> Chui: Start nfs-kernel-server again?

[16:25] <bazhang> hi fogg
[16:25] <onizeth_> hi
[16:25] <Chui> coldboot: what distro ?
[16:25] <coldboot> Chui: I don't remember, something in "ps aux | grep -i nfs"
[16:25] <coldboot> Chui: Gutsy
[16:25] <ikonia> coldboot: just reboot
[16:25] <Chui> coldboot: ghighi... had it comin ;-)
[16:25] <onizeth_> hello
[16:26] <ikonia> coldboot: you don't know what you've done so it's easier to put the machine back to a known status
[16:26] <coldboot> ikonia: I can't, this machine is remote and I don't know if it will come back up.
[16:26] <shaft0> ikonia: basically what you're saying is that using LVM I can essentially mount all my drives to one location (say /media/disk) and then add disks as needed?
[16:26] <ikonia> coldboot: then you should treat things with more respect than killing processes and not knowing what you've done
[16:26] <Oli``> is it possible to give ext3 partitions names like ntfs ones?
[16:26] <coldboot> ikonia: Surely there's a way to get nfs to completely restart.
[16:26] <ikonia> shaft0: correct
[16:26] <coldboot> ikonia: That is obvious now.
[16:26] <ikonia> coldboot: there are many but as you don't know what you've done
[16:26] <shaft0> ikonia: awesome, sounds like a whole lot less setup and work than I was looking at :D
[16:26] <ikonia> coldboot: and if you're not sure if the box will come back up
[16:26] <ikonia> shaft0: it is

[16:49] <MaKc> hi all )
[16:49] <Nostahl> sounds like a window manager?
[16:49] <RedHeron> Vlet: a lot of it has to do with the proprietary format Flash maintains.
[16:50] <Marfi> DanB, there is a checksum if you download flash from the repositories. if you click the flash file on the net, firefox will direct you to the install from adobe's site. install from there, and works lke a charm
[16:50] <Marfi> mike4785, avant-window-manager
[16:50] <RedHeron> Marfi: not necessarily
[16:50] <mike4785> u know how apple has those icons on the bottom that are shortcuts to programs/ in the right it is also the windows you have open

[17:06] <Filled-Void> evgeniXXX, Do you have anythign checked under Ubuntu software. I have the first four selected. once you do that you will get an option to reload packages then imagemagick should be available for install.
[17:07] <bitterbug> Dr_willis: hehe, yeah, it's a good thing i don't have shutdown privs on the SSH i was on

[17:09] <guyvdb_> can anyone help a dependency issue:  qt4-dev-tools: Depends: libqt4-core (= 4.3.2-0ubuntu3) but 4.3.2-0ubuntu3.1 is to be installed
[17:09] <snurre> guyvdb_: that was my initial emergency solution, yeah.. but once im done installing and stuff, will ubuntu be able to find the correct array?
[17:09] <bitterbug> gpalco: just format a partition/drive and copy your home folder contents to it, then once you've installed ubuntu just remap home to that drive
[17:10] <evgeniXXX> Filled-Void, I am not sure, but under "ubuntu software" tab in Software Resources window at the bottom it says, "Cdrom with Ubuntu 7.10 'Gutsy Gibbon' Officially supported" with a check next to it

[17:13] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, openssh-client openssh-server these are the two packages I think
[17:13] <bitterbug> you can do it during the install, or leave it until after you've installed and just change the home location then
[17:13] <Filled-Void> evgeniXXX, Try deselectign one and thenr eselectign ti and close that window and see fi it asks you to reload
[17:13] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: Yes, I know.  But they're not visible in the graphical package manager.
[17:14] <evgeniXXX> Filled-Void, tyring this...
[17:14] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, In the left hand pane you have selected All is that correct?
[17:14] <mightybyte> I typed "ssh" in the search box and nothing showed up.  But both openssh-client and ...server should have been there.

[17:19] <bitterbug> Gpalco: no problem. I find it very handy when doing an install in a busy environment. I just ungplug the drive with the home folder on it so i don't get distracted and wipe it. do the fresh install on the system drive, reconnect the home drive and then map it to the new install.
[17:19] <mightybyte> Filled-Void, If it matters, I just installed ubuntu from an x86_64 liveCD a few days ago.
[17:19] <Whitor> Where can I adjust system audio volume in KDE ?
[17:19] <mightybyte> Filled-Void And I saw this same problem with another package a few days ago.  Can't remember which one though.
[17:19] <MGalaxy> taxman: I want a image viewer + image converter ( GThumb is not good at all)
[17:20] <DanB> ok i have vlc and the plugins installed but how do i use this to watch online video
[17:20] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, I dont think that the repositories would vary for the different install you used. I used the DVD install thought So im not sure if that caused it
[17:20] <taxman> MGalaxy: I only use gimp for that, so I don't know what to tell you. Like I said, it will work
[17:20] <mightybyte> Filled-Void, I have updated, so I would think that it shouldn't matter which CD I used.
[17:20] <Filled-Void> evgeniXXX, You would use apt-cache search to search for you rpackages and apt-get update to get updates.
[17:20] <barbarella> Whitor:kmix
[17:20] <P_Kable> Hi everyone. I just installed mplayer and I can't play any video: Failed to open file://*.mpg, *.avi ... all videos :|
[17:20] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, Exactly
[17:21] <Whitor> thanks barbarella
[17:21] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, Could you post me a screencap of your synaptic :x
[17:21] <Nicolaidis> help with gdesklet
[17:21] <barbarella> P_Kable:try it with VLC
[17:21] <mightybyte> Sure.  Where would I post it?
[17:21] <Filled-Void> P_Kable, Install ubuntu-restricted-extras
[17:21] <evgeniXXX> Filled-Void, ok I see, is that something i need to do every time i can't find a package I am looking for?
[17:22] <sluimers> Hi, how do I change an external HD from fat32 to ntfs?
[17:22] <MrFeetio> gparted
[17:22] <Filled-Void> Nicolaidis, What type of problems. I have some common problems given on my blog. filledvoid.com it contains the ubuntuthreads I used and the methods I used to correct mines
[17:22] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: FWIW, when I search for "vim" all I get is GVim.  vim-tiny and the others aren't there.
[17:22] <P_Kable> barbarella>>  I do not want vlc but mpalyer. Filled-Void I have this package already
[17:22] <Kuropon> is ti possible to have 2 OS running at the same time?
[17:23] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: You just want a screenshot of the main window?
[17:23] <Nicolaidis> when i start it gdesklwt becomes black and doesn't work
[17:23] <sluimers> how? the format to button is grayed out
[17:23] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, by any chance is your cd still in the software sources?
[17:23] <mightybyte> No, I took it out.
[17:23] <Nicolaidis> i install it from synaptic
[17:23] <Filled-Void> P_Kable, Could you check if vlc would play it at all. if it doesnt then it would tell if the codec is not installed
[17:23] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: Should I put it back in?
[17:24] <Kuropon> is ti possible to have 2 OS running at the same time?
[17:24] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, Add your cd to the sources if it is not there
[17:24] <P_Kable> vlc works fine
[17:24] <Filled-Void> Nicolaidis, Install gdesklet-data
[17:24] <lukewarm> Kuropon, yes
[17:24] <taxman> if I want to re-install all of my backed up debs in /var/cache/apt/archives/, can I just run aptitude install * in that dir?
[17:24] <P_Kable> Filled-Void>>  VLC ok
[17:24] <Nicolaidis> i 've installed it
[17:25] <RenatoSilva> [Compiz] The borders of my monitor attract windows. I've found how to deactivate attraction among themselves, but what about attraction between windows and monitor's borders?
[17:25] <barbarella> Kuropon:vmware
[17:25] <Filled-Void> P_Kable, SO you can play in vlc but not mplayer correct?
[17:25] <Kuropon> lukewarm, how would I go about running Linux with a cube interface(4 workplaces) and one of them being a window for windows
[17:25] <Kuropon> barbarella, ?
[17:25] <P_Kable> Filled-Void>>  correct
[17:25] <Filled-Void> P_Kable, You get no output at all or garbled output
[17:25] <Arelis> Hi all. I have a monitor with a resolution of 1440x900. I'd like to do many things at the same time, and see many windows at the same time. How do i do this? Already switched font DPI to size 70, makes everything good, but kind of unreadable. Or hard to read.
[17:25] <taxman> or is there a better way?
[17:25] <DanB> can someone help with installing flash player
[17:25] <netcrash> Hello , while mounting nfs4 volume I get the error can't read superblock, any tips ?
[17:26] <DanB> i have it downloaded
[17:26] <lukewarm> Kuropon, you use a virtual machine
[17:26] <Filled-Void> DanB, Downloaded? from where?
[17:26] <sandeep> does any one know of a channel specific to F-spot
[17:26] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: That didn't seem to change anything.
[17:26] <Kuropon> lukewarm, you'll need to elaborate pls
[17:27] <Filled-Void> taxman, Im looking for an easy way also I used aptoncd till now
[17:27] <lukewarm> !vmware
[17:27] <ubotu> VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository (package "vmware-player", not available for Gutsy, only Feisty and Edgy), and http://www.easyvmx.com/easyvmx.shtml can create VMs for it. Instructions can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware - See also !virtualizers
[17:27] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: I did apt-cdrom add
[17:27] <sluimers> DanB, how hard can it be? at most it's ./configure, make, make install, right?
[17:27] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, And you updated your package list?
[17:27] <lukewarm> Kuropon, ..googling...
[17:27] <Nicolaidis> Filled-Void: is this a common problem???
[17:27] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: Not sure.  Running apt-get update now.
[17:27] <Filled-Void> Nicolaidis, is it working now?
[17:27] <DanB> i downloaded the tar.gz file
[17:28] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, Why i ask is cause both of those packages are on my dvd
[17:28] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: It seems like synaptic is only displaying packages that have graphical interfaces.
[17:28] <P_Kable> Filled-Void>>  no output, only an error message "Failed to open file..."
[17:28] <Filled-Void> DanB, Why not install it from the repositories
[17:28] <Filled-Void> P_Kable, Avi ?
[17:28] <Nicolaidis> Filled-Void:i've installed it...it says that deamon does't work
[17:28] <P_Kable> avi and mpeg
[17:28] <lukewarm> Kuropon, have a look at http://linuxondesktop.blogspot.com/2007/12/running-windows-inside-your-ubuntu.html
[17:28] <P_Kable> Filled-Void>>  avi & mpeg
[17:28] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: Yeah.  I have installed openssh now, but it's still not visible in synaptic.
[17:28] <taxman> DanB: why not just use synaptic to install it?
[17:29] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, :( let me check one more thing brb
[17:29] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: Ok.
[17:29] <Huhnz0r> hello. something got killed in my linux.from windows the ifs partition appears broken, booting up ubuntu, there is an x server error. now i`m here with the live cd. how  can i find out what exactly is my problem and then fix the existing ubuntu install? or just install the 7.07 over the broken dapper drake_
[17:29] <Filled-Void> Nicolaidis, http://www.filledvoid.com/2007/12/20/gdesklets-not-working-on-64-bit-installs/
[17:30] <Filled-Void> Nicolaidis, That might help
[17:30] <qolo> how can I get grep to not print the match, I only want the file names, so I can redirect its output to something that wants only filenames ( emacs )
[17:30] <DanB> ok i guess i have that figured out.but i still cant watch flash video online
[17:31] <Kuropon> lukewarm, sounds great tyvm.. you have any experience with this?
[17:31] <taxman> qolo: man grep, it's definitely in there
[17:31] <qolo> taxman: i have i topen, i cant find it
[17:31] <crush_groove> Huhnz0r,  you shouldnt skip distros on an upgrade .. go from dappy to edgy to fiesty..
[17:31] <rafi> hi all
[17:31] <lukewarm> Kuropon, no.
[17:31] <nixnoob> anyone know if i can access my home folder from windows on a dual boot?
[17:31] <taxman> qolo: ok hold on, haven't read it in a while
[17:31] <Kuropon> lukewarm,  +D
[17:31] <Arelis> Hi all. I have a monitor with a resolution of 1440x900. I'd like to do many things at the same time, and see many windows at the same time. How do i do this? Already switched font DPI to size 70, makes everything good, but kind of unreadable. Or hard to read.

=== brent is now known as brentd
[17:32] <Nicolaidis> i'll try it
[17:32] <nixnoob> crush_groove, read the question its a dual boot not over the network
[17:32] <Filled-Void> P_Kable, For some reason i recall the same issue somewhere however I cant pinpoint it. I think there was changing x11 to something try a search for x11 mplayer cannot play avi Im sure it involved changing x11 to xv something
[17:32] <crush_groove> Huhnz0r,  no
[17:33] <rafi> <Arelis>  whats you resolution right now ?
[17:33] <taxman> qolo: -l is the switch you want I believe
[17:33] <Arelis> rafi: 1440x900
[17:33] <crush_groove> nixnnob .. thank you for telling to read the question
[17:34] <DanB> ok i can see the video but i dont have sound
[17:34] <rafi> <Arelis> 1 min..
[17:34] <crush_groove> Huhnz0r,  each distro builds on the last 1 with upgrades . if you skip from dapper to fiesty you may not have some libs or dependencys that fiesty needs that were in egdy .
[17:34] <Arelis> rafi: alright.
[17:34] <taxman> DanB: do you have sound for other things?
=== Yasumoto_ is now known as Yasumoto
[17:34] <DanB> yes

[17:36] <P_Kable> Filled-Void>>  no it won't work
[17:36] <qolo> taxman:  that got it thx!
[17:36] <rafi> <Arelis> I think beryl does what you looking for
[17:36] <taxman> qolo: np
[17:36] <Arelis> rafi: i can't use that. I'd have to use xgl for that, but it's unstable.
[17:36] <Filled-Void> P_Kable, :( What was the exact error message you were getting and if it is big please use pastebin
[17:37] <crush_groove> sheesh this samba is just what I need I think

[17:38] <taxman> packages contain "Desktop" in their name."
[17:39] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: Ok.  I don't hane EU as an option.  Trying main.
[17:39] <Arelis> rafi: I mean, like, have much screen space, everything smaller, but still readable, so i can have many windows open at the same time, on the same screen, on the same workspace, and look at them all at the same time.
[17:39] <Arelis> Right now, it's so small it's burning my eyes
[17:39] <barbarella> P_Kable:you kidding me.... *.mpg !!!
[17:39] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: Nope, still the same.  No openssh and nothing but GVim, in a "vim" search.

[17:39] <Arelis> rafi: ok
[17:40] <RenatoSilva> [Compiz] The borders of my monitor attract windows. I've found how to deactivate attraction among themselves, but what about attraction between windows and monitor's borders?
[17:40] <Dr_willis> theres settings in the ccsm tool for that.. somewhere.. :)
[17:40] <Arelis> Does anybody know how i can maximize screen space, have like 10 windows open but still be able to read the contents, all next/below eachother, on one workspace, non-overlapping?
[17:40] <nownot> how do i update ubuntu from the command line. also how do i update the kernel?
[17:40] <Filled-Void> P_Kable, Playing all your files?
[17:41] <Dr_willis> Arelis,  you mean auto-tile the windows. resizing them?
[17:41] <P_Kable> Filled-Void>>  yes
[17:41] <Filled-Void> P_Kable, can you play a single file?
[17:41] <rafi> <RenatoSilva> I use my console terminal with out borders
[17:41] <barbarella> nownot:apt-get upgrade
[17:41] <P_Kable> with VLC only Filled-Void
[17:41] <Filled-Void> Nicolaidis, Why create a script ?
[17:42] <jakel1> i have a bit of a problem... i installed Ubuntu 7.10, then i installed windows
[17:42] <Filled-Void> P_Kable, So when you play a single file with mplayer you get the same erro message with the file name?
[17:42] <jakel1> now i can only boot windows and not linux
[17:42] <Arelis> Dr_willis: That, too, if i can
[17:42] <jakel1> however the partition is still there cuz i can see it with Gparted live CD
[17:42] <P_Kable> Filled-Void>>  As I said above, yes
[17:42] <nownot> barberella : will that do kernel and all system stuff? i guess im asking what all will that update
[17:42] <qolo> jakel1:  thats why you do it the other way around
[17:42] <jakel1> and it still has linux on it
[17:42] <Dr_willis> Arelis,  tiling is a feature of the window manager. Some have it. some dont.
[17:42] <crush_groove> jake what drive is windows on ?
[17:42] <qolo> jakel1: insert a recovery CD
[17:42] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: Ok, I tried another server.  Still no luck.  It really looks like I don't have any server (non-graphical) apps showing at all.
[17:42] <crush_groove> leys qodo have it
[17:42] <Clearzen> Could anyone recommend a piece of virtualization software for ubuntu
[17:42] <jakel1> hld on a sec....   qolo... what?
[17:42] <Arelis> Dr_willis: I'm using metacity right now
[17:43] <rafi> <jakel1> install windows first then linux and you grub on lilo will take over your master boot sector
[17:43] <jakel1> lol... to many answers
[17:43] <crush_groove> clearzen openvm
[17:43] <jakel1> rafi is there a way to do it without having to reinstall windows
[17:43] <jakel1> errr.... linux as well
[17:43] <Clearzen> crush_groove: I've been looking at virtual box too. Do you know if it is any good?
[17:43] <qolo> yes - put in the live CD and boot into the existing linux
[17:44] <jakel1> ok]
[17:44] <crush_groove> Clearzen,  I havent used it
[17:44] <Arelis> Dr_willis: I'm using metacity right now. DOes that have it?
[17:44] <qolo> theres a way to tell grub to rewrite the MBR, im not sure how though you'll probably have to look for a tutorial
[17:44] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: Oh, I feel stupid.  I just realized that I wasn't using synaptic.  I was just using the "Add/Remove" option from the Applications menu.
[17:44] <Clearzen> crush_groove: thanks
[17:44] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, gah check in synaptic :D
[17:44] <Dr_willis> Arelis,  no idea.. look and see if it does.. I dont use metacity. I doubt if it does.
[17:44] <Huhnz0r> ok so I now mounted the linux partitition in the live cd of ubuntu. the partitition seems to be fine and accessible. how can I solve the x server problems I get when trying to boot up ubuntu installed on that directory

[17:45] <mightybyte> Filled-Void: Now I know where to look.  Thanks for the help.
[17:45] <Filled-Void> mightybyte, :D
[17:45] <jakel1> it's booting now qolo

[17:47] <Clearzen> evgeniXXX: /usr/bin
[17:47] <Filled-Void> evgeniXXX, The files apt-get installs should be found in the /var/cache/apt/archives folder I think
[17:47] <Dr_willis> nownot,  you did 'apt-get update' first?
[17:47] <evgeniXXX> thank you , i will look there
[17:47] <nownot> err let me try that
[17:47] <aCiD2> Hi, the OS X side of my Mac has just blown up so I was going to take this oportunity to try Ubuntu on it. I can't install refit however, is this going to cause any problems?
[17:48] <Dr_willis> apt-get caches the debs it DOWNLOADS to  /var/cache/apt/archives, in theory the installed files could be going about anywehre. :)
[17:48] <Filled-Void> evgeniXXX, Try the path Clearzen suggested I might be wrong here
[17:48] <nownot> good god 135 to be upgraded
[17:48] <aCiD2> I don't need to boot into any other operating systems - just Ubuntu

[17:58] <Clearzen> evgeniXXX: System>>administration>>synaptic package manager
[17:58] <ijn> what alternative do I have??
[17:58] <vee_> hi all
[17:58] <ijn> eccept open office
[17:58] <evgeniXXX> Clearzen, no luck on find /-name imagemagick, trying synaptic manager
[17:59] <devilsadvocate> ijn ?
[17:59] <The-Warlord> sombody there with cisco and linux routers expierence (pls ingnore my worse english) [oder gehts auch deutsch]
[17:59] <Pici> seenu: The same way you would run any java program.
[17:59] <ijn> any ideas please?
[17:59] <devilsadvocate> ijn , whats wrong with open office?
[17:59] <ijn> to heavy
[17:59] <vee_> Im looking to install 7.10, i have 4gbs RAM - how much swap should i allocate?
[17:59] <devilsadvocate> ijn, i think koffice as a powerpoint equivalent, im not sure  though
=== corneliu1_ is now known as c9s
[18:00] <ijn> any thing else?
[18:00] <devilsadvocate> vee_ , for normal usage minimal swap will do. but hibernation might not be possible without swap> ram
[18:00] <devilsadvocate> ijn, i'm not sure, but i dont think so
[18:00] <devilsadvocate> people use latex to make presentations, if you want :|
[18:00] <vee_> devilsadvocate would i be ok with 5gb swap or should i go for more then
[18:00] <ijn> anything that is not a whole package
[18:00] <Clearzen> vee_:  5GB is to much
[18:01] <Clearzen> vee_: 2GB is all you need really
[18:01] <ijn> like open office kofice
[18:01] <vee_> Clearzen thanx
[18:01] <The-Warlord> the swap memory will be used when you out of ram, this will take a while (with normal applications)
[18:01] <Pici> vee_: Are you going to hibernating your computer ever?
[18:01] <Yancho> how to check how much space i still got on my hard disk?
[18:01] <Filled-Void> evgeniXXX, System > Adminstration > Synaptic > Right click on imagemagick and then select properties
[18:01] <vee_> Pici not often
[18:01] <Pici> Yancho: df -h
[18:01] <Yancho> thanks Pichu0102
[18:01] <Yancho> Pici
[18:01] <evgeniXXX> Clearzen, I was able to locate it in synaptic manager, I clicked on it and under properties was able to find all the files it installed, thank you and thank you Filled-Void too!!
[18:01] <Clearzen> evgeniXXX: np
[18:02] <devilsadvocate> vee_, hibernation is the only problem you will have. if not even 1 gb of ram is more than sufficinet
[18:02] <Pici> vee_: If you do, you'll need more swap than ram.
[18:02] <devilsadvocate> vee_ , sorry.. 1gb of swap, not ram
[18:02] <cheeby> hi.  is there a better alternative to gdesklets?
[18:03]  * cheeby is new to gnome.
[18:03] <Filled-Void> cheeby, Screenlets
[18:03] <vee_> devilsadvocate so 2 gb of swap should let it go to hiber.?
[18:03] <devilsadvocate> cheeby, there were some widgets with compiz fusion. I dont know any details though
[18:03] <[unix]> vee_: no, you need 4 Gb swap or more to hiber
[18:03] <cheeby> running compiz here.
[18:03] <devilsadvocate> vee_, no. Hibernation basically puts all your ram onto the swap, so you will need >4gb
[18:03] <Filled-Void> cheeby, I just use conky I like it . Its light weight also and very customizable
[18:04] <Serg[GPRS]> hi ! i got a crappy USB ADSL modem, tried http://eciadsl.flashtux.org but it's config script asked me so many questions i was unable to answer
[18:04] <vee_> Pici thanx, i keep get dif. answers but i htink it soundsw like more swap than ram is better ( [unix] )
[18:04] <vee_> devilsadvocate 5gb it is!
[18:04] <temetz> how can you define port that xchat connects to ?
[18:04] <Serg[GPRS]> may i still hope to config it, or only option is to buy Ethernet modem ?
[18:05] <vee_> devilsadvocate should all my partitions be Primary?
[18:05] <cheeby> Filled-Void, is conky a window mgr?
[18:05] <devilsadvocate> vee_, none of them need to be primary :)
=== tuna-fish is now known as tuna
[18:06] <cheeby> devilsadvocate, looking into it now...
[18:06] <vee_> devilsadvocate so stick with all my partitions being logical
[18:06] <evgeniXXX> I am very impressed with this forum, this is amazing support, thank you everybody!
[18:06] <cheeby> all I want is a decent weather and calendar desklet.
[18:06] <XxValetexX> hello
[18:06] <cheeby> something that doesn't crash when I try to change something.
[18:06] <XxValetexX> is there a 64 bit version of ubuntu?
[18:06] <vee_> XxValetexX hello
[18:06] <Whitor> XxValetexX: yes
[18:06] <Filled-Void> cheeby,http://conky.sourceforge.net/
[18:06] <devilsadvocate> cheeby, i dont relally remembey but i dont think conky has that
[18:06] <Pici> cheeby: no, conky is a customizable system monitor, not a window manager.
[18:06] <jakel1> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows i am using this tutorial and i have a question about one of the steps
[18:06] <XxValetexX> Whit ty
[18:06] <monkeyBox> Is there any way to unpack a ".sit" file in ubuntu?
[18:06] <XxValetexX> Whitor: thnaks :D
[18:07] <Filled-Void> cheeby, Id recommend screenlets then if you dont like gdesklets
[18:07] <cheeby> Pici, thanks.
[18:07] <jakel1> the sixth step reads, title Windows XP/Vista # You can use any title you wish, this will appear on your grub boot menu
[18:07] <jakel1>  rootnoverify (hd0,0) #(hd0,0) will be most common, you may need to adjust accordingly
[18:07] <jakel1>  makeactive
[18:07] <jakel1>  chainloader +1
[18:07] <cheeby> Filled-Void, ok.  apt-get install...?
[18:07] <Yancho> Y am I getting FTP error 553 for a folder named : elev_contour_3m
[18:07] <iOn|FuXeD> cheeby go to gnome-look.org and search for Screenlets, see if their "look" is appealing then
[18:07] <devilsadvocate> vee_, whatever you like. usually the boot partition is kept primary, but most modern bioses seem to be able to havndle grub on a logica partition also
[18:07] <XxValetexX> Whitor: I wanna get one of those tasty quad cores from AMD :X
[18:07] <Filled-Void> cheeby,  Yup you would do an apt-get install of the package you want
[18:07] <jakel1> after rootnoverify is that hd0,0 suppose to reflect where windows is or where Linux is
=== Spec[x] is now known as Spec
[18:08] <cheeby> ah.
[18:08] <devilsadvocate> cheeby, if you are willing to run kde aps (they will eat up extra ram if you run them on gnome) then superkaramba is awesome
[18:08] <cheeby> devilsadvocate, yeah, I ran superkaramba when I was on kde (gentoo).
[18:08] <vee_> devilsadvocate thanx.... in the middle of reinstalling and last time i just made every partition Primary.... wasnt sure if that was a good or bad thing.... I guess I'll keep the system partition Primary
[18:08] <cheeby> this is a new machine.
[18:09] <NorthByNorthWest> Hi all! Had some problems with compiz and my NVidia 8800 GTS, so after much doubt i installed the drivers using Envy... now when I try to enable compiz/desktop effects Ubuntu says it wants to install the restricted drivers... what to do!?!?
[18:09] <cheeby> so I put ubuntu on it to see how I liked it, trying to give it a fair shake.
=== gradin_ is now known as gradin
[18:09] <devilsadvocate> vee_, you cant have more than 4 primary partitions, included the extended one. PLan your partitioning scheme ar0ound that
[18:09] <Filled-Void> Superkaramba is ncie but wont that require kde dependencies as well?
[18:09] <santh_> how to resume download from bit torrent plz help me
[18:09] <santh_> how to resume download from bit torrent plz help me
[18:09] <imaginaryboy> NorthByNorthWest,
[18:09] <imaginaryboy> 8800gt support comes with new 169.04 nvidia drivers
[18:10] <Filled-Void> santh_, By clicking on it?
[18:10] <vee_> devilsadvocate at this point I only have Ubunutu on it... but I will keep it to just one primary for now.... and logical for all oterh partitions
[18:10] <santh_> how to click
[18:10] <santh_> i cant find it
[18:10] <nils_> hey guys
[18:10] <Filled-Void> AFAIK there should be a torrent client installed by default
[18:10] <XxValetexX> santh_: thats y I use deluge
[18:10] <NorthByNorthWest> imaginaryboy: according to 'NVIDIA X Server Settings' I have 169.07 installed
[18:10] <PirateHead> Filled-Void: It's a crappy torrent client, but it will download torrent files.
[18:10] <imaginaryboy> ah ok
[18:10] <nils_> how can I boot the desktop livecd without X11 (I only want console because I use it via IP KVM)?
[18:10] <imaginaryboy> so it's ok
[18:10] <santh_> help me plz
[18:11] <graelin> what config would I alter vmalloc size in? Getting NVRM rmInitadapter failed error.. says to boost the vmalloc size
[18:11] <Filled-Void> PirateHead, hey it does work. I hear that deluge is good . but I think it kind of hogs resources :x
[18:11] <santh_> what is deluge
[18:11] <XxValetexX> santh_: maybe using deluge and starting it over would be asier for you?
[18:11] <PirateHead> nils_: Can't. Use the server CD instead.
[18:11] <cheeby> Filled-Void, yeah.  superkaramba requires kdelibs and I think kdebase.
[18:11] <NorthByNorthWest> imaginaryboy: I would think so, but compiz wont enable!
[18:11] <Karyom> PirateHead have you tried KTorrent?!
[18:11] <XxValetexX> santh_: or you can just browse your files and check where you are downloading it to and click it
[18:11] <Filled-Void> cheeby, Whichis why i satyed away from it
