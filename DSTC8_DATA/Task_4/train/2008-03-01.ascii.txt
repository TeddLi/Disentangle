[04:08] <Starman> booster........I think it's a licensing issue
[04:08] <googlingtingwana> booster_, same here - point it at /usr/lib/firefox (not /usr/lib/mozilla)
[04:08] <Some_Person> bruenig: and what is the default ubuntu cursor called?
[04:08] <bruenig> Some_Person: haven't the slightest idea
[04:08] <Some_Person> bruenig: oh well, thank you very much, i'll figure it out
[04:08] <dangermike> Anybody on the Seg Fault?
[04:08] <hischild> simple question: what port does ssh run on?
[04:08] <dangermike> 22
[04:09] <hischild> ty
[04:09] <Daisuke_Ido> Pwhdavey: i can't promise anything, but i can give it a shot.  i just finished reading through that thread, and i can understand your...  *frustration*
[04:09] <googlingtingwana> dangermike, did you do a "remove" of firefox or a "purge" - and did you clean up its dependencies?
[04:09] <AtomicSpark> "If you live in a country where it is legal to use this format, to encode AAC files" from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CDRipping, it's legal to use AAC in the us right? :P
[04:10] <Tundra99999> The format is legal - ripping cds probably is only sorta legal
=== ganteng is now known as brain_boy
[04:10] <Daisuke_Ido> how is ripping your own cds "sorta legal"
[04:10] <Starman> lol
[04:10] <dangermike> i didnt as it tried to remove a ton of other stuff including anjuta and other stuff that didnt belong to firefox but i will purge autoclean
[04:10] <Tundra99999> You dont own the content - you have a limited license to it
[04:10] <Daisuke_Ido> that was already determined to be perfectly legal, i thought
[04:10] <Alyx|lappy> anyone trying out the 8.04 a release?
[04:10] <Fwblean> I'm using (x?)tightvnc for my vnc server on an ubuntu box, but every time I connect it gives me a new virtual x desktop
[04:11] <Tundra99999> No - it shifted which court had to hear the arguement
[04:11] <Fwblean> Which vnc servers will let me control my actual Ubuntu desktop?
[04:11] <AtomicSpark> depends if you ask the rpaa
[04:11] <RockinKnight07> hey guys
[04:11] <RockinKnight07> quesion
[04:11] <Sinnerman> is there a way to flush hard disk and memory caches?
[04:11] <AtomicSpark> Fwblean: you have to enable full desktop when you start vnc-server session.
[04:11] <Flannel> Tundra99999: AAC is patent encumbered.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding#Licensing_and_patents
[04:12] <Tundra99999> it's property rights vs. license -- two very different fields of law
[04:12] <RockinKnight07> whenever I try to add a program
[04:12] <AtomicSpark> Fwblean: its in a file somewhere.. let me find the path
[04:12] <Cromag> !enter
[04:12] <ubotu> Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[04:12] <RockinKnight07> it keeps on saying that I don't have a updated list of
[04:12] <RockinKnight07> apps so i cannot add any apps
[04:12] <c0da> i'm trying to get bluetooth to work. it's asking me for firmware location. where in my windows instalation would it be?
=== ganteng is now known as brain_boy
[04:12] <Tundra99999> patent encumbered is not the same as illegal -- I make an AAC using a licensed encoder, I'm good
[04:12] <ere4si> !enter | RockinKnight07
[04:12] <RockinKnight07> is this because my comp has AMD?
[04:12] <ubotu> RockinKnight07: please see above
=== brain_boy is now known as ganteng
[04:12] <Fwblean> AtomicSpark: Okay, thanks
=== speeddemon8803 is now known as Alan_M
[04:13] <RockinKnight07> ohh mkay thanks :P
[04:13] <googlingtingwana> AtomicSpark, you can flush memory associated with file systems using "sync"
[04:13] <ere4si> RockinKnight07, click the reload button
[04:13] <c0da> i'm trying to get bluetooth to work. it's asking me for firmware location. where in my windows instalation would it be?
[04:13] <triorieel> can someone please help me fix my gstreamer?  without it ubuntu is no good to me for obvious reasons. thank you in advanced.
=== ganteng is now known as brain_boy
[04:13] <googlingtingwana> Sinnerman, answered wrong person, oops, try "sync"
[04:14] <Seven_Jews> any one know of a music converter for ubuntu that converts ogg to mp3?
[04:14] <AtomicSpark> Fwblean: $HOME/.vnc/xstartup go find that file. open it in a text editor. it will tell you to uncomment for full desktop.
[04:14] <bruenig> Seven_Jews: ffmpeg
[04:14] <Fwblean> AtomicSpark: Cool, thanks
[04:14] <khaotik> anyone familiar with core ftp?
[04:14] <ere4si> Seven_Jews, mencoder does that well - but is cli
[04:14] <AtomicSpark> googlingtingwana: what? lol
[04:14] <c0da> i'm trying to get bluetooth to work. it's asking me for firmware location. where in my windows instalation would it be?
[04:15] <Seven_Jews> aight ty will try it
[04:15] <tbrock> I'm still kind of confused after reading some of these docs
[04:15] <Sinnerman> googlingtingwana i didn't mean sync/flush to disk, but to clear the cache altogether. like, you know, if you have something cached it loads faster, i want to clear the cache to see how long something would take to load from just having booted up, without having to reboot.
[04:15] <googlingtingwana> AtomicSpark, I answered the wrong handle by mistake
[04:15] <tbrock> what is the first step
[04:15] <bl3u> For the life of me, I can't figure out how to download the madwifi driver
[04:15] <tbrock> I want to get a mentor and work on some packages
[04:15] <AtomicSpark> googlingtingwana: ah thats fine :) just checking.
[04:15] <booster_> thanks guys...i now have flash player working on gusty
[04:15] <KEROLiUKAS> I got a quick question guys..
[04:15] <Flannel> tbrock: #ubuntu-motu has al sorts of stuff for you (check the topic, and the people)
[04:15] <c0da> i'm trying to get bluetooth to work. it's asking me for firmware location. where in my windows instalation would it be????????????????????????????????/
[04:15] <AtomicSpark> so anyone know where that list of free vs non-free formats? i could of sworn i saw one somewhere (ubuntu wiki).
[04:15] <tbrock> ok thanks
[04:15] <tbrock> I'll try there
[04:15] <Flannel> !repeat | c0da
[04:15] <ubotu> c0da: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[04:16] <khaotik> is there an option on either gFTP or Filezilla to edit a file when you click on it like in CoreFTP??
[04:16] <c0da> !patience
[04:16] <ubotu> The people here are volunteers, your attitude should reflect that. Answers are not always available. See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[04:16] <googlingtingwana> Sinnerman, I'm not aware of a utility to do it
[04:17]  * AtomicSpark realises googling the wiki is better then using it's search.
[04:17] <KEROLiUKAS> When i pop in the CD, and the menu pops up, I press Start or Install Ubuntu, and after that I see a black screen..this is with 7.10...Worked fine with 7.4 any ideas?
[04:17] <techqbert> usser: the deb worked by the way.  google earth works fine..
[04:17] <KEROLiUKAS> 7.04*
[04:17] <Sinnerman> googlingtingwana ah well. wsa worth a try anyway.
[04:17] <Starman> http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-583606.html   gsteamer issue..........there should be a fix at that link
[04:18] <pretender_> cant get 1680 x 1050.res on my 22" LCD Wide Screen ob ubuntu 7.10
[04:18] <usser> techqbert: cool im glad it worked
[04:19] <KEROLiUKAS> any ideas?
[04:19] <tbrock> on another note
[04:19] <tbrock> do you guys know what is good to remove to save battery
[04:19] <tbrock> in terms of modules
[04:19] <Some_Person> How do I change the ugly "X" cursor for X servers without a WM to the default ubuntu cursor?
[04:19] <tbrock> does that kind of thing help at all
[04:19] <googlingtingwana> KEROLiUKAS, have you tried the "safe mode" option? - it treats the display differently
[04:19] <iobelix> hey usser! i fixed it!
[04:19] <KEROLiUKAS> yea
[04:20] <usser> iobelix: cool! what was it?
[04:20] <AtomicSpark> gplflash, swfdec, gnash, or flash-non-free: which do you use and why?
[04:20] <amenado> KEROLiUKAS-> how long did you wait after the black screen?
[04:20] <KEROLiUKAS> googlingtingwana after a quick google, other 8800 series users report that problem, though no fix posted
[04:20] <iobelix> usser, it was so simple! i feel so stupid. my MAC address. i have the mac filter enabled. and i did not have the mac address of the wireless card on the permission list!
[04:20] <bruenig> Some_Person: look in /usr/share/icons for all available cursors
[04:20] <bl3u> help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Madwifi states that madwifi is installed in 7.10, but modprobe -l |grep ath_pci returns nothing. I can't find any debs to download - any ideas how I get madwifi on 7.10?
[04:20] <bruenig> each directory name should be a separate curor theme
[04:20] <Some_Person> bruenig: it doesnt seem to work
[04:20] <bruenig> or somesuch
[04:20] <usser> iobelix: haha are you serious? :)
[04:20] <iobelix> usser, wpa2 officially works out of the box in ubuntu!
[04:20] <Starman> http://www.ask.com/web?l=dir&o=ffx&q=ubuntu+fix+for+gstreamer
[04:20] <KEROLiUKAS> i waited like 2-5 minutes, but ussualy i would expect to see the loadig screen..
[04:21] <bruenig> it works
[04:21] <bluefoxx> is there a way i can copy all my floppy diskettes to a floppy image? like a command line cammand?
[04:21] <Some_Person> bruenig: I used Xcursor*theme:DMZ-White
[04:21] <bruenig> I am doing it right now for dwm which doesn't have any mouse handling stuff
[04:21] <Zyferian> I can't seem to enable the Nvidia drivers because I'm missiong nvidia-glx-new . Any ideas?
[04:21] <AtomicSpark> iobelix: doh! i've enabled mac filtering while on wireless once. that was dumb. :P
[04:21] <usser> bluefoxx: look into dd
[04:21] <Some_Person> bruenig: but when I start a new Xserver I still get the ugly "X"
[04:21] <Cromag> Zyferian: yes.
[04:21] <amenado> KEROLiUKAS-> perhaps wait longer?
[04:21] <Cromag> Zyferian: did you just boot the box up as new ? - New install of ubuntu ?
[04:22] <Zyferian> cromag, yes, brand new... just finished the instal.
[04:22] <googlingtingwana> KEROLiUKAS, I think there's also a text mode - have you tried that?
[04:22] <amenado> KEROLiUKAS-> also look what is happening during boot ... at ctrl+alt+f1
[04:22] <usser> bluefoxx: something like dd if=/dev/fd of=/pathtoimage
[04:22] <efren30> i need help please i just installed ubunut everything working perfect except one thing i installed a visual effect and was working fine the windows would wobble wen i grabbed them etc.. i kept meesing around with it to get the 3-d cube and now the visual effect says none and when i try putting extra it says desktop effects could not be endab le please help and thanks.
[04:22] <Cromag> Zyferian: reboot again, and dont install the -new drivers yet.
[04:22] <iobelix> usser, yes yes dumb is me! i don't care, me happy!! seriously though, all this talk i hear of wpa2 not working, i always thought it was a linux issue, not the router. but man, it works out of the box. i honestly configured nothing extra at all!
[04:22] <Cromag> Zyferian: after that try with restricted drivers.
[04:22] <KEROLiUKAS> yea i tried text mode, no worky...what exactly is ctrl alt f1 supposed to do?
[04:22] <KEROLiUKAS> show all the status like in the old versions?
[04:22] <Fwblean> AtomicSpark: I can't seem to find the full desktop section in $HOME/.vnc/xstartup - any suggestions? I can pastebin the file
[04:22] <bluefoxx> and if so, what is the command?
[04:23] <Zyferian> cromag, I tried the restricted drivers thing and it asked for the nvidia-glx-new package
[04:23] <Daisuke_Ido> quick question - what's the default kernel version for gutsy?  (including ubuntu revision number) 2.6.22-14?
[04:23] <amenado> !who | KEROLiUKAS
[04:23] <ubotu> KEROLiUKAS: As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say (use !tab), or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
[04:23] <Cromag> Zyferian: weird, i just had the same problem... i just rebooted and installed the restricted stuff..
[04:23] <Cromag> Zyferian: then it worked.
[04:23] <Some_Person> bruenig: am i doing something wrong? or do i need to reboot? or does it only apply to one Xserver?
=== Fersure is now known as Fersure|brb
[04:23] <KEROLiUKAS> amenado sorry about that
[04:23] <Zyferian> cromag, well, it's working on rebooting right now and we'll see what happens then.
[04:23] <tbrock> or what is the command to see how much power you are currently drawing
[04:23] <Flannel> !afk > Fersure|brb
[04:23] <usser> iobelix: im happy for you, it also may depend a lot on the wireless chipset one has
[04:24] <bluefoxx> usser: kk, ty
[04:24] <Fersure|brb> o.o
[04:24] <Cromag> Zyferian: ok. get back to me :)
[04:24] <AtomicSpark> Fwblean: do you see this: "# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:"?
[04:24] <olskolirc> hey guys where can I do to upload a quick pic please?
[04:24] <Flannel> Daisuke_Ido: yes
[04:24] <efren30> i need help please i just installed ubunut everything working perfect except one thing i installed a visual effect and was working fine the windows would wobble wen i grabbed them etc.. i kept meesing around with it to get the 3-d cube and now the visual effect says none and when i try putting extra it says desktop effects could not be endab le please help and thanks.
[04:24] <Fersure|brb> Errmmm.....
[04:24] <Daisuke_Ido> Flannel: that's *exactly* what i wanted to hear.
[04:24] <tbrock> got it acpitool -B
[04:24] <KEROLiUKAS> googlingtingwana / amenado :yea i tried text mode, no worky...what exactly is ctrl alt f1 supposed to do?
[04:24] <dangermike> olskolirc  imageshack.us ?
[04:24] <bluefoxx> i want to archive all my old programs on fdd onto a backup hard disk
[04:24] <olskolirc> thanks
[04:24] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: You trying to setup VNC ?
[04:24] <Fwblean> AtomicSpark: No
[04:24] <amenado> KEROLiUKAS-> its where dmesg dumps its status during boot
[04:24] <dangermike> bluefoxx your question has already been answered
[04:24] <Flannel> Daisuke_Ido: http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/linux-image-generic
[04:24] <Fwblean> Cpudan80: Yeah, trying to get normal desktop under xtightvnc
[04:25] <KEROLiUKAS> amenado im going to try it now, when exactly do i press it?
[04:25] <dangermike> <usser> bluefoxx: something like dd if=/dev/fd of=/pathtoimage
[04:25] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: Yeah, th instructions that come with Ubuntu are wrong --- you have to do two things
[04:25] <__mikem> Hey Flannel did I tell you, I FINALLY have a native install of ubuntu
[04:25] <Flannel> __mikem: glad to hear it
[04:25] <bluefoxx> dangermike: i see that. i am stating the reason i wish to know, incase someone has a better way. ok, thanks
[04:25] <amenado> KEROLiUKAS-> after you make a selection from the menu
[04:25] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: So, first, enable the default thing under system --> prefs --> remote desktop
[04:25] <tbrock> hey so i found out that i may want to unload bluetooth, firewire, and usb
[04:25] <Fersure|brb> Okay Flannel .
[04:25] <KEROLiUKAS> amenado : all right thanks...ill go try
[04:25] <AtomicSpark> Fwblean: do you have vnc server installed? not just the client! wait ubuntu desktop. its built in! do waht CPU says
[04:26] <Fersure|brb> Didn't know.
[04:26] <Fersure|brb> ty
[04:26] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: THat'll let you VNC in when someone else is logged in (similar to XP desktop sharing)
[04:26] <Some_Person> How do I change the ugly "X" cursor for X servers without a WM to the default ubuntu cursor?
[04:26] <Zyferian> cromag, yeah, same thing happened. Says nvidia-glx-new is not enabled.
[04:26] <tbrock> when i try to rmmod those modules it says that it doesn't exist in /proc/modules, do you guys have any idea why
[04:26] <Cpudan80> AtomicSpark: No, it's not built in - Ubuntu definitely half assed the VNC stuff
[04:26] <tbrock> they show up in lsmod
[04:26] <bl3u> Is there not a madwifi deb? I can't install madwifi from teh repositories?
[04:26] <Cromag> Zyferian: thats because it got installed somehow then, is this in the restricted drivers window ?
[04:26] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: Once you do that, you need to actually setup a VNC server so you can VNC in when nobody else is logged in
[04:26] <efren30> i need help please i just installed ubunut everything working perfect except one thing i installed a visual effect and was working fine the windows would wobble wen i grabbed them etc.. i kept meesing around with it to get the 3-d cube and now the visual effect says none and when i try putting extra it says desktop effects could not be endab le please help and thanks.
[04:27] <amenado> tbrock-> does it do the same if you do modprobe -r modname ?
[04:27] <mocie_girl> halooooooooooooooo
[04:27] <Zyferian> cromag Yes, indeed
[04:27] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: lemme get that tutorial
[04:27] <dangermike> bl3u http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/GettingMadwifi#Downloading.debs
[04:27] <Cromag> Zyferian: and if you enable it ?
[04:27] <tbrock> let me check that out
[04:27] <Cromag> Zyferian: or at least try :)
[04:27] <Fwblean> Cpudan80: I setup xtightvnc using apt-get
[04:27] <Flannel> efren30: Probably best to wait something like 15 minutes in-between instead of just a couple
[04:27] <Zyferian> cromag then it just gives that message... doesn't get any farther...
[04:27] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: That might be wrong...
[04:27] <tbrock> amenado, nope that works
[04:27] <tbrock> how did you know that would work and how is it different
[04:28] <Fwblean> Cpudan80: What should I be using instead?
[04:28] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: gimmiea sec to get the tutorial
[04:28] <Adys> What's the package to read .rars ?
[04:28] <Fwblean> Cpudan80: Okay, sure
[04:28] <Adys> Dont need to create them
[04:28] <prince_jammys> Adys: unrar
[04:28] <bl3u> dangermike: thank you, but I thought for sure Ubuntu would support atheros out of box
[04:28] <Adys> cheer
[04:28] <efren30> flannel:what do you mean for someone to answer my question?
[04:28] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: http://www.movingtofreedom.org/2007/02/16/howto-remote-desktop-with-vnc-in-ubuntu-edgy-gnu-linux/
[04:28] <bl3u> dangermike: I'm not sure why they don't
[04:28] <dangermike> it should
[04:28] <Cromag> Zyferian: ok, i tried the same and actually ended up with "no screens found" - now i tried again, and just rebooted after the install. Enabled the restricted drivers and it worked. i did not mess with anything before that. After that i did a sudo nvidia-settings to fix screens.
[04:28] <lordleemo> Fwblean: sudo apt-get install vnc4server  good tutorial here http://www.movingtofreedom.org/2007/02/16/howto-remote-desktop-with-vnc-in-ubuntu-edgy-gnu-linux/
[04:28] <bl3u> dangermike: I just installed 7.10 server, and it didn't give me ath_pci
[04:29] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: The gdm stuff is at etc/gdm/gdm.conf --- otherwise it is still valid
[04:29] <bl3u> dangermike: and I can't find anywhere from Ubuntu that I can download it
[04:29] <Ashfire908> i hit some key combination, and i got the stopped process thing, i forget how do i resume the program?
[04:29] <Zyferian> cromag I haven't touched anything before this either... for the record
[04:29] <dangermike> bl3u i havent tried it with 7.10 but with nubuntu and it worked, meh you can get the deb from madwifi no biggie
[04:29] <Fwblean> Okay, thanks Cpudan80, lordleemo, I'll remove xtightvnc and see how vnc4server goes
[04:29] <amenado> tbrock i believe moprobe takes care of dependencies too
[04:29] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: Either one would probably work --- but I know that that tutorial works in the end
[04:29] <Cromag> Zyferian: thats weird, really... try and see what sudo nvidia-settings does.
[04:29] <googlingtingwana> bl3u, the madwifi software is available in one of the extra software sources - just enable it synaptic
[04:29] <tbrock> awesome thanks man
[04:29] <Potter> Hi all
[04:30] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: You may want to firewall off all ports but 5900 too
[04:30] <Potter> Just checking out Xchat on Xubuntu

[04:30] <Cpudan80> Fwblean: Leaving the GDM open to the world isn't really a good idea

[04:31] <aghachi> how do i edit xorg.cont manuelly? i want to input more resolutons for my monitor 2.. its at 640x480... but it can handle 1280x1240 but it doesnt show in nvidia settings... and when i found the file to edit i didnt have permission to edit it

[04:33] <Cromag> Zyferian: well thats what im thinking, it SHOULD not do any - oh ehm you are using 7.10 right ?
[04:33] <Zyferian> cromag Definitely ... just downloaded this morning
[04:33] <dangermike> efren30 if your using compiz you go to system->Prefs->Advanced Desktop Effect Settings
[04:33] <fdsjkalf> When I press a hotkey, I dont know what the system interprets the key as. How do I make the system display the written key function?
[04:33] <amenado> Ashfire908-> suspend is not same as killing the process though
[04:33] <Cromag> Zyferian: im on 7.04 :( - might be the reason.
[04:33] <Ashfire908> amenado, i know.
[04:34] <amenado> fdsjkalf-> run   xev and then press the hotkey to get a description

[04:35] <ubotu> bl3u (you might want to check them all): gutsysources is in System->Admin->Software Sources, enable (main) (universe) (restricted) and (multiverse) and disable the Cdrom on the Ubuntu Software tab. On the Updates tab, enable (gutsy-security) and (gutsy-updates).
[04:35] <triorieel> anyone who knows anything about the sounds system of ubuntu, I need your help as I have somehow buggerd mine up by using the synaptic package manager

[04:38] <Zyferian> googlingtingwana: do you have any advice for getting nvidia drivers working that don't wanna?
[04:38] <dangermike> bl3u  whats the package name that you need?
[04:38] <nickrud> bl3u: ah, missed that. The repos listed there are worth checking, anyway :)
[04:38] <efren30> dangermike did you get it?
[04:38] <dangermike> efren30 no i still dont have any pm's
[04:38] <dangermike> Zyferian its not supported but i used envy and it worked very well for me
[04:38] <dangermike> !envy
[04:38] <ubotu> envy is not needed or supported. Use the Resticted Manager to install binary drivers and see <unconvertable> /msg ubotu binarydriver <unconvertable>
[04:38] <googlingtingwana> Zyferian, they just worked for me, after enabling them and a couple of reboots :)
[04:39] <efren30> how would i only be abe to see what you type for me mike?
[04:39] <bl3u> dangermike: I thought it was madwifi
[04:39] <Zyferian> So no one's heard of the whole nvidia-glx-new thing not enabled? or not working? etc?
[04:39] <bl3u> dangermike: I can find madwifi_tools, but no madwifi. I uncommented all the repos
[04:39] <dangermike> efren30 ill put your name in front if it ^_^
[04:39] <bl3u> dangermike: And did an apt-get update; aptitude search madwifi
[04:40] <dangermike> bl3u do you know what the package name is that you need to install?
[04:40] <triorieel> ubuntu finds soundcard and can use it to play startup music, but it can't find it in gnome? why?
[04:40] <bl3u> dangermike: not for a fact, no. i am assuming it would be madwifi
[04:40] <googlingtingwana> Zyferian, you could see if the nvidia site has a later version, but then you are somewhat on your own
[04:40] <efren30> dangermike: ok i want some effects likle beryl 3-d desktop thing can u im me the packages i need to rock my pc please

[04:42] <dangermike> efren30 install compiz
[04:42] <eifzon> it says its already installed
[04:42] <Bossmanbeta> anyone aware of a way of detaching a remote X application running via 'ssh -Y' for re-attaching later? (Just like 'screen' but for X apps) There's an old-old app called 'xmove' (last updated 1997) but it's very buggy and doesn't work. VNC and NX are whole-desktop solutions and doesn't work well when I want to run local & remote apps on a unified local desktop.
[04:42] <Long> Is there a key for minimizing full screen application like games? Windows has a key for this action as u all know...

[04:44] <googlingtingwana> bl3u, I'm leading you astray, even though I'm using madwifi drivers I don't have madwifi-tools installed - I'm still looking into it
[04:44] <Zyferian> googlingtingwana cromag I got it... I think... it was the problem with the (restricted) package repositories not being enabled... that didn't allow Ubuntu to download the gfx drivers that it needed to enable the thing properly.
[04:44] <efren30> how can i check the version i have
[04:45] <efren30> and danger were can i download the one you have =)
[04:45] <bl3u> googlingtingwana: from what i understand the tools just allow you to work with the interface once it's utilized by a driver
[04:45] <nickrud> Long: alt f9 iirc

[04:47] <Luke2008> anyone knows how to install gui on 7.10 server
[04:47] <dangermike> efren30 just install emerald and it will begin working after you install compiz
[04:47] <demonspork> the last thing it outputs is your compiz version
[04:47] <bl3u> dangermike: googlingtingwana: i must be doing something wrong, i have that package. i don't have to reboot do i?
[04:47] <Some_Person> How do I change the ugly "X" cursor for X servers without a WM to the default ubuntu cursor?
[04:47] <Dr_willis> Luke2008,  easy way is install the 'ubuntu-desktop' package
[04:47] <nickrud> Long: bummer.

[04:47] <Dezine> I'm having a sound issue, I don't know what I did but it used to work and now all of a sudden it doesn't. Anyway to re-set it up? I have an Nvidia Nforce if that helps at all.

[04:48] <tehCurtis> not finding it anywhere
[04:48] <Long> Yes, I got no answer on the Ubuntu forums as well. Its truly unbelievable, what do game players do when they have a message from  IM program??
[04:48] <dangermike> bl3u yeah that would do it
[04:48] <amenado> jack-desktop-> but you do have java already? which version?
[04:48] <nickrud> Some_Person: you might try   sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme
[04:48] <dangermike> tehCurtis what are you trying to "reload"
[04:49] <tehCurtis> init.d/ssh
[04:49] <bl3u> dangermike: googlingtingwana: thanks very much for your help. pointed me in the right direction :)
[04:49] <Zyferian> how do you restart the X server?
[04:49] <dangermike> sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
[04:49] <tehCurtis> ah
[04:49] <tehCurtis> thanks!
[04:49] <dangermike> Zyferian control alt backspace
[04:49] <Some_Person> nickrud: Will this apply to X servers without any DM (such as GDM)?
[04:49] <Bossmanbeta> anyone aware of a way of detaching a remote X application running via 'ssh -Y' for re-attaching later?

[04:49] <Zyferian> dangermike thanks
[04:50] <SimplySeth> can I just set alias r8169 eth0 ? in  /etc/modprobe.d/aliases ?
[04:50] <Some_Person> nickrud: Wait, thats already set to the cursor I want, and I still get the ugly "X"
[04:50] <triorieel> having issues with gstreamer itself, could someone assist me in getting it operational so I can control my sounds card again?
[04:50] <efren30> dangermikre:what do i do?

[04:50] <dangermike> efren30 i am having a very hard time understanding why you cannot install a package via synaptics. I have given you clear directions on how to do so.

[04:53] <jack-desktop> amenado, how do i fidn the java version? i should have the most recent
[04:53] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  You can.. but its a big hassle. thers some very tiny window managers out. Like  jwm.
[04:53] <dangermike> java --version

[04:54] <Bossmanbeta> amenado, I was looking for a way to stremline the remote X apps with local apps on the unified-local desktop, (which 'ssh -Y' does very well) but the detach-part is the problem for the remote X apps
[04:54] <SimplySeth> Luke2008: what GUI ?
[04:54] <Some_Person> Dr_willis: I shouldn't need to install a WM to run 1 app fullscreen
[04:55] <Zyferian> cromag How do you have your dual monitors set up?
[04:55] <Luke2008> xorg
[04:55] <SimplySeth> Luke2008: UbuntuStudio ? Gnome ? KDE ? XFCE ?
[04:55] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  do what you want.. but ive tried that task befor.. and it can be a big hassle.
[04:55] <amenado> Bossmanbeta-> http://www.ubuntu-unleashed.com/2007/12/howto-setup-multiple-nested-x-sessions.htm  <-- this was the one i thought is much closer to what you seek

[04:55] <eifzon> Anyone can help me with this? has to to with my jail: http://pastebin.ca/924258

[04:55] <Bossmanbeta> amenado, bad link
[04:55] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  depends on the app. all it takes is one dialog or somthing to pop up and you cant activate it..  and you are stuck
[04:55] <efren30> jack-desktop:ok i cant endable visual effects i had installed a compiz but guess i earased it can you tell me were i can download a compiz and everything needed to rock my computere like 3-d cube wobble window when grabbed

[04:56] <amenado> jack-desktop-> what happens when you use the firefox beta it does not like your java?
[04:56] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  xset command I belive changes that
[04:57] <Cromag> Zyferian: right now 2 seperate screens but the mouse can go between them. Just not with apps or other stuff.
[04:57] <jack-desktop> amenado, it just says i need to install a missing plugin

[04:59] <dangermike> Dezine have you checked alsamixer to make sure nothing is muted
[04:59] <Some_Person> Dr_willis: yeah, but how do you make it actually work? And I have no problem with the regular ubuntu cursor, if there were some way to make that work.
[05:00] <luisgmarine> What is the easiest way to change the icon in the main menu?  Instead of using the default ubuntu sign I want something else
[05:00] <efren30> k
[05:00] <nirir> hi, steve,..
[05:00] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  artwiz replaces the default x cursor.
[05:00] <Amaranth> whoa lag
[05:00] <Zyferian> cromag Oh, there we go... thanks... was having issues with that
[05:00] <Some_Person> Dr_willis: oh, ok
[05:00] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  gnome and kde have theor own 'cursor' system.. then theres the original X cursirs
[05:00] <jack-desktop> amenado, yes.
[05:00] <eifzon> Anyone can help me with this? has to to with my jail: http://pastebin.ca/924258
[05:00] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,   the X cursors are actually font files. :) i recall.
[05:00] <Cromag> Zyferian: oh you got it that far :D - i still need some other settings for it to be what i need though.
[05:00] <Dezine> dangermike, alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device
[05:01] <Cromag> !flash
[05:01] <ubotu> To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash (for !Dapper and !Edgy, a recent version is available in !backports) - See also !Restricted and !Gnash
[05:01] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  so you will see the artwiz cursor in window managers   other then gnome, most likely
[05:01] <amenado> jack-desktop-> there you have been a link to your  /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins  or /usr/lib/firefox*/plugins
[05:01] <Bossmanbeta> amenado, that's a cool program, but it won't survive the disconnect of the ssh tunnel, it just allows for independent apps to run within a virtual X session laid-over your real X session
[05:01] <Some_Person> Dr_willis: makes sense, what does it look like?
[05:01] <efren30> jack-ddesktop: look what it says for compiz-gnome:
[05:01] <efren30>  Depends: libwnck18 (>=2.15.90) but it is not installable
[05:01] <dangermike> Dezine are you part of the group plugdev ?
[05:01] <nirir> some body............?
[05:02] <nirir> Has quit?
[05:02] <amenado> Bossmanbeta-> oh okay..i look around for some more when i get a chance
[05:02] <Y-Town> Anyone know why when I try to set my monitor resolution and hit "administrator" it blanks out the screen and refreshed and does not let me access the area?  Using KDE
[05:02] <googlingtingwana> Cromag, did the standard flash install work for you on Gutsy? - it didn't for me - I had to install the tar.gz from Adobe
[05:02] <Zyferian> cromag Yeah, I finally figured out my problem and got the drivers installed... it's working out pretty nicely... still am wishing I had two monitors that were the same size one is 17 and one is 19
[05:02] <wrath144> if i'm having trouble installing with the live cd, will using the alternat help at all?
[05:02] <jack-desktop> amenado, what do you mean "you have been a link"
[05:02] <nickrud> nirir: as away, this is a free for all (within limits, of course :)
[05:02] <soreau> Would anyone willing to help me configure LVM with the 7.06 ubuntu alt cd? I'm getting mixed messages as the live cd has an option to do so, but this guide shows that I should configure LVM _after_ installing? Any ideas welcome, thanks.       http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/
[05:02] <nickrud> nirir: ask, that is
[05:02] <Cromag> googlingtingwana: it did not, im trying to fix gnash and see if it works.
[05:02] <efren30> jack-ddesktop: look what it says for compiz-gnome Depends libwnck18 (>=2.15.90) but it is not installable
[05:02] <Bossmanbeta> amenado, I'm really greatful -- I'll keep asking at regular un-annoying intervals.. you never know who has gone through the same trial-n-tribulation and solved it entering a channel this big
[05:02] <dangermike> "Seg Fault (core dump)" happens with epiphany, galeon, and firefox 2.0.0.12. I tried  moving the .mozilla folder and creating a new profile, as well as reinstalling firefox, and downloaded firefox 2.0.0.6 college student edition. Firefox is still seg faulting, it is now installed under /opt instead of ~, any ideas on how to fix this or find whats causing it to happen?
[05:02] <amenado> jack-desktop-> i meant there should have been a link there ..im on the firefox 2.x  so it has that plugin
[05:02] <Cromag> Zyferian: i believe it can be fine with those two sizes.
[05:03] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  an arrow :) sort of like the spaceship on asteroide
[05:03] <dangermike> i have purged and autoclean on firefox and reinstalled and i still seg fault
[05:03] <efren30> jack-desktop: look what it says for compiz-gnome Depends libwnck18 (>=2.15.90) but it is not installable
[05:03] <Dezine> dangermike, I don't think so, it's not listed under users settings.
[05:03] <nirir> hi, nickrud!
[05:03] <rich__> hello
[05:03] <Zyferian> cromag Yeah, it works... just not as nice as having two 19's
[05:03] <amenado> Bossmanbeta-> correct..someone must have done it beforehand..
[05:03] <soreau> I am at the partitioning screen now with two disks completely free space
[05:03] <dangermike> Dezine i googled your error and found a post stating that it fixed the problem for one person you may want to add that group but it may not be your fix :\
[05:03] <Cromag> Zyferian: i have 2 x21 :P
[05:03] <Dezine> alright I'll try
[05:03] <Cromag> Zyferian: just to rub it heh
[05:04] <Zyferian> cromag Yeah, well... bah to you! heh
[05:04] <nirir> Nickrud may i join with u?
[05:04] <Cromag> heh
[05:04] <jack-desktop> efren30, i'm not really sure, i'm not a tech here or anything
[05:04] <Some_Person> Dr_willis: ermm, I installed it, and it changed my cursor in gnome, but in the xserver without WM, I still got ugly X
[05:04] <nickrud> nirir: no, this is a support channel. I don't chat much
[05:04] <luisgmarine> anyone know how to change the main menu icon?
[05:04] <Bossmanbeta> amenado, I've found at least 100 forum posts on the subject ... each thread ended with similar frustration & no answer... so others are trying it.... In fact, I posted this as a suggestion for a feature in http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com and it's gotten thusfar 7 comments of "oh wow that'd be a great feature" type of comments
[05:04] <jack-desktop> amenado, so what should i do?
[05:04] <amenado> Y-Town-> do this first   xhost +localhost:root  to add root access to your local display,
[05:04] <good> how do i configure the default runlevel? /etc/inittab doesn't exist.. i don't want to boot up into X windows
[05:04] <googlingtingwana> dangermike, do you have any stack trace output from firefox that you could possibly google for?
[05:04] <nickrud> nirir: but if you have questions about ubuntu, ask here in the channel, if some knows the answer they'll speak up
[05:05] <amenado> Bossmanbeta-> your requirement is a nice one..i hope they the developers look into it
[05:05] <wrath144> if i'm having trouble installing with the live cd, will using the alternat help at all?
[05:05] <dangermike> googlingtingwana i ran firefox -g however i am not fimilar with DDD is their anyother way?
[05:05] <Cromag> googlingtingwana: acutally, i went to youtube and tried watching a movie, it popped up saying i needed the pluing, and it installed for me and i watched the clip.. :)
[05:05] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  no idea then.    Could be the window manager has to do the seting. There is some old command that sets the x pointer.. but i dont rember what it is - havent used it in 5+ years.
[05:05] <nickrud> good: ubuntu doesn't use run levels like that. It starts in run level 2, but X runs in 2-5 anyway. install bum , and use that to turn off gdm in run level 2
[05:06] <amenado> jack-desktop-> when the firefox beta installed, was there a similar  /usr/lib/firefox* directory for it?
[05:06] <Bossmanbeta> amenado, agreed... I think in the day of gui apps as we're in ... it only makes sense ... not that 'screen' isn't extremely useful (it is) .. but I think it's time for an X version of the same thing
[05:06] <good> nickrud: thanks
[05:06] <jack-desktop> amenado, there was a ~/firefox
[05:06] <dangermike> .mozilla
[05:06] <amenado> Bossmanbeta-> ideas like yours keeps these developers and us users happier..
=== steve__ is now known as vorian
[05:07] <Cromag> Zyferian: i still need to be able to move my apps around between the windows.. but still 2 desktops..
[05:07] <googlingtingwana> dangermike, sometimes if you run it from the shell it will dump out a stack trace, but it depends on whether it has any symbols
[05:07] <amenado> jack-desktop-> is that where you have the firefox beta installed?
[05:07] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  doing some googling for info - found --> http://osdir.com/ml/xfree86.devel/2003-12/msg00271.html
[05:07] <Bossmanbeta> amenado, indeed... only in the community can growth and happiness thrive :)
[05:07] <jack-desktop> amenado, yes
[05:07] <Zyferian> cromag Yes... I would like to do that myself... let me know if you find a solution
[05:07] <efren30> jack-desktop:wowowowomg i got it yay i got the compiz setting  i opened it what i do now?
[05:07] <Cromag> Zyferian: i had one once hehe
[05:07] <jack-desktop> efren30, what are you trying to do?
[05:07] <xeenan> Does anyone know of a website were i can get a patch for pc games
[05:07] <Zyferian> cromag Wasn't one of those permanent types, eh?
[05:08] <regeya> so bossmanbeta you want, um, holy fricking frack, what was the name of the x server based on vnc...not finding it in the repos, but I swear I ran it 10 years ago.
[05:08] <Cromag> Zyferian: huh ? - brb
[05:08] <efren30> jack-desktop:put the cube the flame writing the closing ash page
[05:08] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, VNC and NX (nomachine) are whole-desktop solutions ....
[05:08] <Estesark> My screen fades out after about ten minutes of inactivity, regardless of whether Compiz is active. I can't find any settings to change this in Power Management. How can I disable this or increase the time it takes before it fades?
[05:08] <jack-desktop> efren30, press ctrl+alt+click your mouse to use the cube
[05:08] <good> is there a text-based alternative to "bum" for managing the runlevel scripts such as rc-update and chkconfig for gentoo and redhat/centos respectivelly.. ?
[05:09] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, I'm looking for an application-specific detachability becuase I run remote and local apps on my local desktop ... I've tried VNC/NX... which work, but I have to size the whole-desktop down to just the single-application border... which is a needless pain in my opinion :)
[05:09] <regeya> bossmanbeta: I see...you want to be able to detach from the x server.
[05:09] <pretender> cant get 1680 x 1050 resolution help
[05:09] <jack-desktop> efren30, fire you need to do super+shift+click mouse
[05:09] <dangermike> googlingtingwana when i run from term i just get the seg fault thats it. I seen the debug flag section in the man pages but no actual flags to use, any you can recommend ? (firefox --gtk-debug=xxx)
[05:09] <googlingtingwana> amenado, jack-desktop, things are running by too fast for me to see what started your discussion, but does it have to do with placing plugins in /usr/lib/mozilla versus /usr/lib/firefox?
[05:09] <Zyferian> cromag Oh, if you had one once, you don't anymore... at least that was what I figured you meant
[05:09] <regeya> cool
[05:09] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, precisely ... just like 'screen' offers for shell-based apps
[05:09] <bluefoxx> ok, so i installed a new DVD burner recently, however, i still dont have a /dev/dvd entry in my system, it just connect the dvd burner to /dev/cdrom. how can i fix this?
[05:09] <jack-desktop> googlingtingwana, no google, i'm tryng to get my java to work in firefox beta
[05:09] <Daisuke_Ido> he's taking a while getting back :\
[05:10] <Daisuke_Ido> i hope the driver worked
[05:10] <amenado> jack-desktop-> then does it have a plugins directory? that is where you put a copy of that libjavaplugin.so or a symlink from /etc/alternatives/libjavaplugin.so
[05:10] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, you're thinkg of xmove?
[05:10] <dangermike> bluefoxx my dvd player is listed as /dev/cdrom
[05:10] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, that buggy-not-working-POS ?  :-)
[05:10] <nickrud> Some_Person: what does  /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme say?
[05:10] <Dr_willis> Some_Person xsetroot  --help
[05:10] <dnquark> folks, Gnome doesn't load for me, says "Gtk-WARNING **: This process is currently running setuid or setgid."...
[05:10] <Dr_willis> Some_Person xsetroot  -cursor_name <cursor-font name>
[05:10] <bluefoxx> dangermike: yea, but i need it to be /dev/dvd, some programs are refusing to use it otherwise
[05:10] <amenado> googlingtingwana-> yes, he is looking for libjavaplugin.so for the firefox beta
[05:10] <Some_Person> nickrud: Inherits=DMZ-White
[05:10] <Some_Person> Dr_willis: ok
[05:10] <soreau> Would anyone willing to help me configure LVM with the 7.06 ubuntu alt cd? I'm getting mixed messages as the live cd has an option to do so, but this guide shows that I should configure LVM _after_ installing? Any ideas welcome, thanks.       http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/
[05:10] <soreau> I am at the partitioning screen now with two disks completely free space
[05:11] <nickrud> Some_Person: then that's not helping. See Dr_willis above though
[05:11] <googlingtingwana> dangermike, there's a firefox-dbg package which has symbols - you could try installing that to see if it provides more information from the crash
[05:11] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  and i got NO idea where ya get the name from. :)
[05:11] <regeya> Bossmanbeta: heh, I did a search, and that came up...to tell the truth, Bossmanbeta, I use enough different OSes that detachable x apps just aren't an issue for me.
[05:11] <dangermike> googlingtingwana awesome! ill look for that
[05:11] <Some_Person> Dr_willis: i'll try to figure it out
[05:11] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, by that u mean you use rdesktop or citrix type stufff?
[05:11] <Dr_willis> xsetroot -cursor ~/bits/shuttle.bm ~/bits/mask.bm
[05:11] <googlingtingwana> jack-desktop, not sure if it's related, but when I manually installed flash I had to put the plugin into /usr/lib/firefox, not /usr/lib/mozilla
[05:11] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  guess its just a normal bitmap file. :)
[05:12] <amenado> Bossmanbeta-> i wonder what the embedded linux folks have for that.. they seem to be a good user or such features
[05:12] <bluefoxx> and BTW, how can i trace a IP address over msn? some asstards are harassing a person whom happens to be very close to me...very bad harrassment...[creepy pedophelia stalker harrasment]
[05:12] <Some_Person> Dr_willis: bitmap?
[05:12] <regeya> bossmanbeta, I try to keep it cross-platform and open-source so it's by and large vnc
[05:12] <jack-desktop> googlingtingwana, amenado thanks i got it working
[05:12] <regeya> and of course ssh for console apps
[05:12] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, this is a very-specific need, I agree... but to me... for ssh to offer remote X-apps ability via the -Y option, to NOT be able to detach it (at least to provide survivability in case of disconnect) doesn't make sense to me
[05:12] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  we are talking OLD skool :)
[05:12] <dnquark> Anyone?..  Basically, Gnome refuses to load if I have an .xsession file in my ~/, even if the file is blank.  Any tips on how to troubleshoot it?  This is more or less a fresh install of Ubuntu
[05:12] <j_> Are there programs for tn3270???
[05:13] <amenado> jack-desktop-> where did you have to put that libjavaplugin.so?
[05:13] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb.mit.edu/project/doc/ibitmap/ibitmap.html
[05:13] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, VNC (or NX) is the only solution for the moment, and I just make a sour-puss while sizing the window down to the 1-application borders...
[05:13] <bluefoxx> so how can i trance a IP address?
[05:13] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  now ya know why i just install jwm or  some other window manager and let it handle it.
[05:13] <Some_Person> Dr_willis: ok
[05:13] <usser> bluefoxx: you can run some sort of a traffic sniffer on the machine that runs the IM
[05:13] <jack-desktop> amenado, ~/firefox/plugins
[05:13] <usser> bluefoxx: like wireshark
[05:13] <bl3u> What's the diff b/t the server kernel and the generic kernel?
[05:14] <amenado> jack-desktop-> okay....let us know how it goes..
[05:14] <regeya> so you're saying xmove isn't worth the effort, eh, Bossmanbeta :->  I guess I won't mess with it then (though I've often wanted such a thing)
[05:14] <NewbieJohn> Anyone up for a /dev question?
[05:14] <bluefoxx> usser: i have that, it claimed no suitable interface to scan.
[05:14] <zcat[1]> bl3u: preemption
[05:14] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, oh by all means... tinker-away............. if you get it working, give me your paypal acct and I'll fwd a you're-super-smart tax that I must pay to all those that I'm not worthy to talk to :)
[05:14] <soreau> Would anyone willing to help me configure LVM with the 7.06 ubuntu alt cd? I'm getting mixed messages as the live cd has an option to do so, but this guide shows that I should configure LVM _after_ installing? Any ideas welcome, thanks.       http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/

[05:15] <soreau> I am at the partitioning screen now with two disks completely free space
[05:15] <amenado> NewbieJohn-> we will respond if we knew the answer or led you to google :P
[05:15] <nickrud> !patience soreau
[05:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about patience soreau - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[05:15] <bl3u> zcat[1]: is that it?
[05:15] <nickrud> !patience | soreau
[05:15] <Flannel> soreau: You do it during partitioning
[05:15] <ubotu> soreau: The people here are volunteers, your attitude should reflect that. Answers are not always available. See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[05:15] <NewbieJohn> Right on, okay, so I'm trying to get DVD's to play on my computer using gxine
[05:15] <Bossmanbeta> nickrud, (lol)
[05:15] <regeya> !flood | soreau
[05:15] <ubotu> soreau: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[05:15] <NewbieJohn> And part of this appears to be linking dvd to scd0
[05:15] <Daisuke_Ido> still not back :\
[05:15] <regeya> whoops
[05:15] <usser> bluefoxx: eh, how do you connect to the internet?
[05:15] <NewbieJohn> unfortunately due to my misunderstanding of how to use "link" i managed to blow away my scd0
[05:15] <Daisuke_Ido> and he's still not back
[05:16] <soreau> nickrud: I am a support team member in #cf but am about to ditch ubuntu and use another distro
[05:16] <NewbieJohn> so how do I recreate this without re-installing ubuntu
[05:16] <zcat[1]> bl3u: afaik the only difference is that the desktop kernel has some preemption patch which makes the desktop feel 'snappier' at the slight expense of overall performance
[05:16] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, xmove hasn't been touched since 1997...... 'nuff said :)
[05:16] <bluefoxx> usser: ethernet
[05:16] <soreau> This channel is horridly flooded
[05:16] <googlingtingwana> bl3u, http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3715071 has some comparison information
[05:16] <Zyferian> rpm's don't work in Ubuntu do they?
[05:16] <nickrud> soreau: your choice.
[05:16] <bl3u> googlingtingwana: thanks
[05:16] <usser> bluefoxx: then you have an interface
[05:16] <nickrud> Zyferian: no
[05:16] <Cromag> Zyferian: now it works for me, i enabled the XineRama option in the same place..
[05:16] <bluefoxx> usser: i know that...
[05:16] <regeya> soreau, good luck with that.  I had lvm2 set up on a machine at work, and ended up making the machine a debian etch machine rather than drop lvm2 or hacking on the danged thing...
[05:16] <berlylabs> Has anyone here played yahoo games on their ubuntu OS yet? I can't get mine to work
[05:16] <Pichu0102> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v34/Pichu0102/Screenshot-SystemMonitor.png Is this normal after browsing for a few hours?
[05:17] <Flannel> soreau: I aleady told you.  You do it during partitioning.  Partition them as LVM partitions, then go up to the LVM manager thing and setup your VGs and LVs
[05:17] <berlylabs> have tried tutorials for installing java and I think it's installed but still not working
[05:17] <Dr_willis> berlylabs,  depends on the game. Ive gotten many to work with wine.
[05:17] <bl3u> zcat[1]: so if i'm setting up a home fileserver, i should be fine using -generic?
[05:17] <ntolo> How can i deny other users access to firefox and give access to the root only.
[05:17] <regeya> Bossmanbeta: heh, in 1997 I wasn't exactly following things like xmove :-)
[05:17] <amenado> NewbieJohn-> there use to be a MAKEDEV in /dev/ dont know if that still exist, run it and it creates all the dev it needs, but if its using udev now...not sure what the equivalent is
[05:17] <Cromag> Zyferian: its a small checkbox i would call it... and now i need my REAL charset hehe :P
[05:17] <usser> bluefoxx: you have to run it using sudo
[05:17] <berlylabs> dr_willis: I"m trying to get spades in particular
[05:17] <soreau> Flannel: Please elaborate
[05:17] <soreau> Flannel: This is my last hope
[05:17] <bluefoxx> usser: ah, that explains it lol
[05:17] <hellppmme> hi
[05:17] <zcat[1]> bl3u: I don't think there's any noticable difference unless your server's handling mad-high loads
[05:17]  * bluefoxx tries wireshark again
[05:17] <soreau> I am at the partitioning screen now with two disks completely free space
[05:17] <Flannel> soreau: There's nothing else to elaborate on.  Partition them in the partitioner as lvm type, then scroll up to the top, to the LVM manager orwhatnot, and enter that.
[05:17] <Zyferian> cromag Oh, perfect... that is right, awesome. I need a better background that big... heh
[05:17] <Bossmanbeta> regeya, 1997 was a blur ... the dot.com bubble days
[05:18] <Dr_willis> berlylabs,   if its a downloadeable/exexutable - it may work with wine. Other then that.. good luck. :) ive seen a lot that DONT work with wine also. since they are some how flash-based in a weird way
[05:18] <bl3u> zcat[1]: Cool. Generic it is
[05:18] <Cromag> Zyferian: hah yes :) me to :P Devianart ftw.
[05:18] <berlylabs> what is wine?
[05:18] <soreau> Flannel: I would not be asking for help if I was not confused..
[05:18] <ntolo> How can i deny other users access to firefox and give access to the root only?
[05:18] <pbjman> Okay, so i'm trying to make ubuntu appear more user friendly for mac users by using mac4lin; On linux-live.org it says to build the aufs kernel module. I tried their precompiled kernel and it kept giving me this error that if I googled came up nothing.
[05:18] <Cromag> but now i cant start a normal terminal anymore...

[05:18] <NewbieJohn> so the good news is that makedev works
[05:18] <usser> bluefoxx: and you should be able to manually specify the interface to capture on just go to capture->interfaces
[05:18] <pbjman> How would I go about "compiling the aufs kernel module"?
[05:18] <NewbieJohn> it puts them in .static/dev/
[05:18] <Flannel> soreau: Well, like I said, create partitions (one per drive) as type LVM.
[05:18] <Zyferian> cromag I still can.
[05:18] <soreau> Flannel: I have in the partitioner two drives hda and hdb as free space
[05:18] <NewbieJohn> the bad news is that it didn't recreate a scd0
[05:19] <wease|> hello folks
[05:19] <Cromag> Zyferian: well, gonna trouble shoot for it..
[05:19] <soreau> Flannel: Ok, I will attempt this ..
[05:19] <hellppmme> im trying to install ubuntu 7.01 but when im in select partition the old partitions werent detected,how can i solve this cuz i have a created partition already and i cant see it in this installation window? anyone pls?
[05:19] <bluefoxx> usser: kk, tyvm
[05:19] <regeya> soreau: you'll need to set up your partitions manually.  if I recalled what the install screen said, I could step you through it...but I don't remember, sorry :-(  I did most of the setup on a work machine last time back...well, over a year ago.
[05:19] <amenado> NewbieJohn-> brw-rw---- 1 root cdrom 11, 0 2008-02-26 23:23 /dev/scd0   on mine
[05:19] <usser> bluefoxx: no problem
[05:19] <sweetsinse> what else can i use to manage the desktop besides nautilus or xfdesktop
[05:20] <soreau> regeya: I'm right on the edge of accomplishing this task .. any further ideas are welcomed
[05:20] <amenado> NewbieJohn-> i think if  your reboot, it may recreate all those /dev/xxx thats needed..i forgot where i read that from
[05:20] <Odd-rationale> Does anyone know whether "The Revolution OS" (http://thelinuxway.blogspot.com/2007/10/revolution-os-video-story-of-linux.html) is available as a torrent somewhere? Thanks!
[05:20] <hellppmme> yoh
[05:20] <hellppmme> anyone care to help me?
[05:20] <nickrud> sweetsinse: openbox , blackbox , fluxbox , waimea . search synaptic for window manager
[05:20] <Flannel> soreau: Oh sorry, forgot one thing.  Create a small ext3 partition as well.  You need /boot to be not in LVM
[05:20] <zcat[1]> !piracy | Odd-rationale
[05:20] <NewbieJohn> okay, here's an alternative plan
[05:20] <sweetsinse> i am using compiz
[05:20] <pbjman> No one knows how?

[05:20] <sweetsinse> in xubuntu
[05:20] <sweetsinse> i thought there was a separate app that drew the desktop
[05:20] <NewbieJohn> Can someone run a "file" command on their /dev/scd0 and tell me what it returns?
[05:20] <Dr_willis> I thought that video was in the gpl. :)
[05:21] <zcat[1]> is it?
[05:21] <soreau> Flannel: Hmm...
[05:21] <NewbieJohn> because that might just be a link to another file
[05:21] <zcat[1]> It probably ought to be :)
[05:21] <regeya> sorry, my 'torrenting movies' detector went off ;-)
[05:21] <Odd-rationale> zcat[1]: Oh, the video is not free?
[05:21] <Dr_willis> at least i THINK its under some open license
[05:21] <Zyferian> cromag Did you get Flash working then?
[05:21] <Dr_willis> I bet some googling will find out.
[05:21] <Frogzoo> where can I get a pirate copy of ubuntu please?
[05:21] <amenado> NewbieJohn-> from what i pasted it should be a block device
[05:21] <pbjman> lmao
[05:21] <Alan_M> frogzoo! LOL!
[05:21] <Dr_willis> Frogzoo,  in #debian-warez
[05:21] <Cromag> Zyferian: yeah, just visit yuotube
[05:21] <Odd-rationale> zcat[1]: sorry.
[05:21] <amenado> NewbieJohn-> brw-rw---- 1 root cdrom 11, 0 2008-02-26 23:23 /dev/scd0   on mine
[05:21] <sweetsinse> is there a way to make thunar handle the desktop? mainly to get the rectangle when you drag
[05:21] <Flannel> soreau: So, make three partitions.  One small one formated ext3, then two large ones with LVM type
[05:21] <hellppmme> yoh
[05:21] <Some_Person> Dr_willis: Hey! I found the X cursor: /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/cursor.pcf.gz
[05:22] <soreau> Flannel: I have ext3 mount point / opts default label none but how big does the boot part need to be?
[05:22] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  there ya go. :)
[05:22] <regeya> well, holy moly, revolution os is on google video.  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7707585592627775409
[05:22] <NewbieJohn> okay, I'll try the reboot option
[05:22] <berlylabs> How would i get it to work using wine, I see the ubuntu thing but what file would i run on wine
[05:22] <NewbieJohn> Thanks!
[05:22] <hellppmme> which part of ubuntu installation to select the right partition to install?
[05:22] <Zyferian> cromag Which one did you install?
[05:22] <Dr_willis> Some_Person,  now edit it to look like a ... err... somthing else. :)
[05:22] <Flannel> soreau: No, all those will be in LVM.  You just want /boot off of LVM.  It only has to be a few hundred megs
[05:22] <soreau> Flannel: I cannot find the where to set the LVM type yet
[05:22] <Cromag> Zyferian: visit youtube and it will do it for you.
[05:22] <soreau> Flannel: How many hundred?
[05:22] <SimplySeth> what is the environment variable for libraries  ?
[05:22] <RedHeron> regeya: please pay attention to fair use next time. ;-)
[05:22] <Flannel> soreau: one should be fine, two is definately sufficient
[05:23]  * RedHeron gives regeya a hard time because torrent !== illegal.
[05:23] <ntolo> How can i deny other users access to firefox and give access to the root only?
[05:23] <Bossmanbeta> isn't !== redundant? just need (1) =
[05:23] <amenado> SimplySeth-> env  | less to see which one you need
[05:23] <SimplySeth> amenado: thanks
[05:23] <regeya> RedHeron, this is one of the times I wish moderators would turn a blind eye for a couple of minutes.
[05:23] <soreau> Flannel: gotcha. I will be in touch
[05:23] <Daisuke_Ido> ntolo: unwise (going online and especially running firefox as root)
[05:23] <nickrud> hah
[05:23] <RedHeron> Bossmanbeta: Depends on the syntax... that's PHP syntax.
[05:24] <Alan_M> torrent=safe unless the CONTENTS of the torrent are illegal.
[05:24] <Zyferian> bossmanbeta (2) = 's means logically equivalent to... for the record
[05:24] <regeya> RedHeron: because I would tear you a new one for assuming that I wouldn't know that.
[05:24] <Bossmanbeta> RedHeron, ah..... in SQL it's !=
[05:24] <hellppmme> Flannel or Cromag help me pls? when i click Places then Computer i can see the partitions but when i double click INSTALL icon in the desktop,reaching at the Select Partition window,all i see is just /dev/sda and no more specific partition like /dev/sda5 or /dev/sda1, how can i solve this?
[05:24] <dangermike> Does anybody know what could be wrong when anything using the Mozilla engine seg faults galeon, epiphany, firefox versions 2.0.0.6 & 2.0.0.12 as well as version 3 all seg fault?
[05:24] <RedHeron> regeya: Assuming? No. Just making fun. :D
[05:24] <RedHeron> Bossmanbeta: Right, but in PHP, a single "=" means "store the left into the right".
[05:25] <soreau> Flannel: This bootable will be at mount point '/' correct?
[05:25] <regeya> RedHeron: I'm sick and tired of pretentious kiddies trying to act like they know more than me when I slip.  Whoopsie!  I assumed that because Revolution OS was on DVD, and because someone was asking for torrents of the movie, that they were pirating something.  Let's make fun of the ignorant guy!
[05:25] <Bossmanbeta> RedHeron, :) well not being a php-person, we just spoke past each other, is all........ :-)
[05:25] <Flannel> soreau: bootable flags don't matter
[05:25] <RedHeron> regeya: permission to PM?
[05:25]  * regeya thanks ${DEITY} for /ignore
[05:25] <Alan_M> but...thats sliding towards off topic
[05:25] <Alan_M> or even past off topic
[05:25] <Flannel> soreau: Oh, /boot is mount point /boot
[05:25] <RedHeron> Bossmanbeta: Yep.
[05:25] <regeya> RedHeron: two words, the second is 'no.'
[05:25] <soreau> Flannel: ok
[05:26] <Zyferian> cromag Dang... that Flash is buggy as all get out
[05:26] <RedHeron> regeya: I find your attitude hostile and unproductively unhelpful... I'm not allowed to make a joke, apparently.
[05:26] <ntolo> Daisuke_Idd: I mean the root should be the only one to execute the firefox command.
[05:26] <zcat[1]> regeya: just readling the rev-os website I can't see anything that says it's CC or otherwise available for free..
[05:26] <soreau> Flannel: I have now 197.4 MB ext3 /boot.  How do I partition the rest?
[05:26] <Alan_M> the flash fix was put in the repositories i thought zyferian
[05:27] <soreau> (two other drives)
[05:27] <Flannel> soreau: create them, make them LVM type
[05:27] <hellppmme> yoh
[05:27] <Zyferian> alan_m not sure, I'm having issues with it
[05:27] <soreau> Flannel: I will attempt
[05:27] <Cromag> Zyferian: its buggy ? i havent checked.
[05:27] <Alan_M> i fresh insttalled ubuntu..and enabled the restricted extras and havent had problems ;)
[05:27] <SimplySeth> apt and aptitude are not finding my variables
[05:27] <SimplySeth> my libraries*
[05:27] <hellppmme> can anyone see my message?
[05:28] <soreau> Flannel: Selected 'primary', now I do not see where to set the type 'LVM'
[05:28] <Flannel> hellppmme: yes
[05:28] <nickrud> hellppmme: yes,
[05:28] <hellppmme> ok
[05:28] <Dr_willis> hellppmme,  No... err..i mean yes.. :)
[05:28] <Flannel> soreau: You need to edit the partition (like where you set the mount point) and change the type to LVM
[05:28] <soreau> ok
[05:28] <hellppmme> what about my previous message above? can someone help me with my problem pls?
[05:28]  * Alan_M thwaps Dr_willis across the wrists
[05:28] <regeya> ok.  license on the Revolution OS DVD is:  "This DVD is for private home viewing only. It is not licensed for any other use. All Rights Reserved. Unauthorized copying, public exhibition, and broadcast are strictly prohibited. <unconvertable>  So yes, torrenting this is PIRACY.
[05:28] <Zyferian> alan_m Did you just download it specially? Or what? And which repositories was it in?
[05:29] <Alan_M> i downloaded it using the regular repositories that shipped with the cd.
[05:29] <Cromag> Zyferian: going to bed now..
[05:29] <zcat[1]> regeya: yeah, that's what I thought too.. I can't find any reference to it being free, anywhere..
[05:29] <Cromag> Sat Mar  1 06:29:17 CET 2008
[05:29] <Zyferian> cromag Night, man... good luck... be seeing ya around
[05:29] <Dr_willis> regeya,  so you can Not watch it with your friends.. or on the bus, or anywhere else theres another person. :)
[05:29] <nickrud> regeya: please let it drop ...
[05:29] <Cromag> Zyferian: we will, nite.
[05:29] <soreau> Flannel: It says 'Mount point for this partition' but no LVM option now. Though it had an option for LVM groups before deleting these partitions
[05:29] <Alan_M> im assuming its in multiverse zyferian, but i used add/remove to get it.
[05:29] <Odd-rationale> Sorry, guys. I assumed that because it was about FSF/Linux that the dvd was free. I'll be more careful next time...
[05:30] <berlylabs> when i go to yahoo games i get    This game cannot be played using your current settings. Please, try the following:    Check to make sure that java is enabled in your browser. (learn more)  If you do not have java installed you may download it here.  To learn more about java support for browsers, visit our help pages.   But if I go there and then check to see that i have java, it says i do
[05:30] <Flannel> soreau: no, no.  You odn't change the mount point, you change the partition type.  Same screen though.  Don't select a mount point
[05:30] <Zyferian> alan_m Alright, I'll try that then
[05:30] <RedHeron> hellppmme: Yes.
[05:30] <zcat[1]> Odd-rationale: It's on youtube though... the quality won't be great :)
[05:30] <soreau> Flannel: I am in no hurry, I am listening to you
[05:30] <hellppmme> RedHeron: can you help me?
[05:31] <Zyferian> alan_m wait, add/remove?
[05:31] <FloodBot3> !netsplit
[05:31] <ubotu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like Freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
[05:31] <Daisuke_Ido> oho
[05:31] <zcat[1]> Oh yay.. DeCeeCee again?
[05:31] <Odd-rationale> Netsplits are becoming more common nowadays...
[05:32] <Daisuke_Ido> that netsplit probably looked a whole lot more impressive from the other side :D
[05:32] <dangermike> yeah
[05:32] <regeya> zcat[1]: I think that people assume that because it's...*sigh* wow, several people have responded to me, and I'm not supposed to respond...okay, once again, *I'm* the one called on the carpet for being OT.  OK, just so I don't get banned for 24 hours again, I'll wrap it up by saying that sounds like a pretty standard copyright statement, and that people assume that somehting's free because it's about free software.  so I'm
[05:32] <regeya> going to be a good little boy and drop it now.  please leave me alon.  all I did was respond to someone wanting to pirate, then repsonded to someone calling me ignorant.  Pardon me for caring. :->
[05:32] <soreau> Flannel:  I found this option: physical volume for LVM and physical volume for RAID. Which should I chose ?
[05:32] <Alan_M> Daisuke_Ido, it looks the same from both sides :)
[05:32] <Flannel> soreau: PV for LVM
[05:32] <soreau> thanks
[05:32] <Bossmanbeta> they should have virtual IP's for IRC servers with failover ability to ensure connectivity
[05:32] <mneptok> soreau: you plan to use LVM?
[05:32] <soreau> Flannel: Bootable flag now? (on|off)
[05:32] <Zyferian> Afk for a while
[05:32] <Daisuke_Ido> Alan_M: but it doesn't.  there's a whole lot more quits from the other side (900+)
[05:33] <soreau> mneptok: yes
[05:33] <RedHeron> Bossmanbeta: You're talking about adding features to IRC???
[05:33] <mneptok> soreau: keep /boot *out* of the LVM
[05:33] <zcat[1]> regeya: I'm on your side.. I said it wasn't CC first.
[05:33] <Flannel> soreau: no.  Modern OSs don't care about bootables
[05:33] <Bossmanbeta> RedHeron, lol ... who, me?
[05:33] <Flannel> mneptok: He is.
[05:33] <Alan_M> well if you want to put it that way..you are correct.
[05:33] <soreau> mneptok: We already got that far
[05:33] <mneptok> soreau: excellent
[05:33] <soreau> Flannel: Great
[05:33] <Alan_M> i am a network administrator for a small irc network, ive seen that so many times its almost funny.
[05:33] <Flannel> soreau: Once you've done that, go back to the volume group thing.
[05:33] <Bossmanbeta> RedHeron, hey if it were up to me.. I'd run them off independently off large VM's and mirror them
[05:34] <soreau> Flannel: ok
[05:34] <pbjman> How would I use linux-live to make a custom ubuntu cd? I have a laptop with ubuntu installed and everything configured the way I want it; just, linux-live is bitching at me, claiming it can't copy aufs from it's precompiled kernel they provided.
[05:34] <RedHeron> Bossmanbeta: That would be fun to set up. :-)
[05:34] <mneptok> pbjman: what is your goal?
[05:34]  * soreau hopes it is not frozen
[05:35] <Alan_M> and...their slowly coming back.
[05:35] <Flannel> pbjman: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
[05:35] <Bossmanbeta> RedHeron, imagine it ... virtual IP connections with fully transparent TCP stacks mirroring to VMs.... it'd be like RAIDing the IRC :-)
[05:35] <soreau> Flannel: I will read this msg now, sec
[05:35] <mneptok> pbjman: a system that's easy to resetup in case of reinstallation?
[05:35] <RedHeron> Bossmanbeta: I know... I was thinking about redundancy.
[05:35] <zcat[1]> Redundant Array of IRC Discussion?
[05:35] <Alan_M> Random array of irc discussion.
[05:35] <Alan_M> :P
[05:36] <Bossmanbeta> or .. we can just enjoy the netsplits like we did in the 1990s and enjoy the little bit of nostalgia we have left............. :-)
[05:36] <RedHeron> Bossmanbeta: But then the fun part would be tunneling protocols and obtaining a QoS guarantee for IRC relays on every continent. :-)
[05:36] <soreau> Flannel: Ok, it just warns that I cannot undo what i am doing ;)

[05:38] <Daisuke_Ido> you'll have better luck re-ripping ...  what odd said
[05:38] <jscinoz> Daisuke_ido, i tested it out on a few before, i couldnt notice any difference
[05:38] <Flannel> soreau: No.  You need to create one volume group using both your physical volumes.  You can name it anything you'd like, but usually people just do vg00 or something similar. (VG for volume group)
[05:38]  * RedHeron does run an IRCd for developmental purposes on his Ubuntu box, FWIW.
[05:38] <Bossmanbeta> RedHeron, ... of course... I will go to my ATM in fantasyland (where we're building this monument to IRC'dom) and withdraw the funnymoney for it.. or maybe I'll enter next year's WSOP and go all in on a 7/2 offsuit :-)

[05:41] <soreau> (Virtual Group?)
[05:41] <uno> i'v made sure the md5 sum is the same
[05:41] <mneptok> Alan_M: please move the netadmin discussion elsewhere.
[05:41] <regeya> jscinoz: bad idea re-encoding mp3 -> ogg.  Re-rip if you must do taht; you'll end up with files that are far lower quality than ogg provides if you rtransencode, and vorbis is about as good as faac in the quality dept. and be sure to use sound juicer, the ripper of ubuntu!  (keeping it on-topic.)
[05:41] <uno> i'v burned the cd at 4x
[05:41] <uno> and 2x
[05:41] <Flannel> soreau: You create a volume group, that volume group is a virtual disk, as far as we're concerned.  Then we'll create logical volumes ontop of that, which mimic partitions if we were doing this outside of LVM.  They can be whatever sort of filesystem you like.  Ubuntu uses ext3 by default.
[05:41] <Bossmanbeta> what's with all the offtopic police....
[05:41] <jscinoz> regeya, what about mp3 > flac?
[05:41] <Flannel> soreau: volume group
[05:42] <Bossmanbeta> self-made deputys i tell ya
[05:42] <Odd-rationale> uno: have you tried: http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm
[05:42] <mneptok> Bossmanbeta: look at the channel. and this is quiet.
[05:42] <Alan_M> mneptok, if you have been reading, i actually DID move that discussion elsewhere and moved on...but thanks for paying attention :)
[05:42] <nickrud> heh uno You've made sure you wrote it as an image? When you look at it in windows, it's not just one file on the cd?
[05:42] <RedHeron> Okay, seriously... where do I find a list of MD5sums to match against, say, /bin/login to make sure it hasn't changed?
[05:42] <Bossmanbeta> sorry, mneptok ?
[05:42] <mneptok> Alan_M: 00:40 < Alan_M> relax and enjoy the ride :)
[05:42] <soreau> Flannel: ubuntu uses ext3 by default. thanks
[05:42] <RedHeron> Bossmanbeta: Feel free to PM me or join one of the other channels.
[05:42] <uno> ya i tried iso recorder
[05:42] <Alan_M> and...ubotu would say the same thing..so ubotu's going offtopic as well?
[05:42] <mneptok> Bossmanbeta: there is a reason for keeping things on support only topics. please respect it.
[05:42] <uno> ya i burn it as an image
[05:42] <uno> when i brows the cd it is a bunch of files
[05:43] <mneptok> Alan_M: last warning.
[05:43] <regeya> jscinoz: you'll end up with much larger files that sound remarkably like your mp3s.  I'd just recommend gritting your teeth and either re-rip or keep using a non-free format.
[05:43] <nickrud> uno: ok. Could be you need the alternate cd, some machines won't boot the live cd
[05:43] <jscinoz> >_<
[05:43] <uno> well my brother burned ubuntu 7.04 and i got that working
[05:43] <TrustNoOne> oh man is floodbot flooding again?
[05:43] <uno> but then the cd became currupt and it doesnt work anymore
[05:44] <regeya> jscinoz: ultimately, it's your choice.  if you transcode to vorbis, and it sounds fine to you, by all means go for it :->
[05:44] <zcat[1]> TrustNoOne: it's aptly named then :)
[05:44] <nickrud> uno: 7.04 is not 7.10 ...
[05:44] <efren30> jack-desktop:wich one is the button super?
[05:44] <uno> i no but should it matter?
[05:44] <googlingtingwana> soreau, sorry to sidetrack you here .... if LVM still works as it used to, then you can add extra volumes on the fly at a later time ... if you are having trouble getting the partitions set up you could just use the "guided LVM (not encrypted)" option which will configure all of one of your drives
[05:44] <regeya> TrustNoOne: when I got banned for a day, it was for complaining about the floodbot.

[05:45] <Bossmanbeta> anyone aware of a way of detaching a remote X application running via 'ssh -Y' for re-attaching later? (Just like 'screen' but for X apps) There's an old-old app called 'xmove' (last updated 1997) but it's very buggy and doesn't work. VNC and NX are whole-desktop solutions and doesn't work well when I want to run local & remote apps on a unified local desktop.
[05:45] <googlingtingwana> soreau, thank goodness for TAB, right?
[05:45] <reZo> hello, my ubuntu system is hanging at fsck, how can i resolve this: http://rafb.net/p/8Cjz6I95.html
[05:45] <soreau> Flannel: I pressed one wring button, now I am here at the Finish option
[05:45] <SimplySeth> what in the world does apt need to find its own libraries ?
[05:45] <soreau> wrong*
[05:45] <soreau> googlingtingwana: Yes :D
[05:45] <Flannel> soreau: go back?
[05:46] <uno> ok i am downloading 7.04 ill see if that works thx
[05:46] <regeya> reZo: nothing after that line?  um...I don't know...looks like all is well
[05:46] <Flannel> soreau: You should be able to go back and just re-configure LVM.  The VG should be there still I believe (although it may not be), but the PVs will be there.
[05:46] <soreau> Flannel: I will select 'Finish' now as my group name is VG0
[05:46] <reZo> regeya: yeah, it hangs there, nothing after that line apart from the pointer blinking.
[05:46] <soreau> I set  it up
[05:46]  * soreau crosses fingers
[05:46] <Flannel> soreau: did you create at least one logical volume for /?
[05:46] <soreau> Flannel: I don't think so ;)
[05:46] <reZo> it's been like this for about 20 minutes now :S
[05:46] <uday> sound is not coming when i play video.what to do now?
[05:47] <soreau> Ok, I think I see now
[05:47] <reZo> and it's happened for the last few boots, and hasn't gotten passed this point
[05:47] <soreau> Flannel: What should the logical volume name be?
[05:48] <hypomnema> Does anyone know where the "highlight mouse cursor when I press control" checkbox is on 7.10/gutsy gibbon?
[05:48] <soreau> Flannel: What should the logical volume name befor '/'?
[05:48] <Flannel> soreau: You can name it whatever you like, I named mine lv-[partition] where [partition] is what I was going to use it for (lv-root, lv-home, etc)
[05:48] <hypomnema> (Preferences -> Mouse is missing the Cursors tab on my machine for some reason.)
[05:48] <soreau> Flannel: I am at this point now ...
[05:49] <soreau> Flannel: I am curious as to how it will show up in /dev
[05:49] <yao_ziyuan> does ubuntu support listening to realaudio streaming?
[05:50] <regeya> I know this is ot but what is mode J
[05:50] <vrkhans> i have a problem, i tried to install the java doc, got some error in installing the doc, so i quite it, but now if i try to install any thing it again stop at that error thing that java doc could not be install, how i can fix that.
[05:50] <uday> can anyone help me.sound is not coming?is this a problem with audio driver?
[05:50] <nickrud> yao_ziyuan: I've had success on some streams with the mozilla-mplayer plugin, with the w32codecs
[05:50] <Flannel> soreau: it's /dev/mapper/[VG]-[LV], or at least is in Dapper.  It'll probably just show up as UUIDs in more recent versions
[05:51] <soreau> Flannel: You do not use even edgy eft, feisty fawn or dare i say gutsy?
[05:51] <regeya> and why does flood bot keep having to set mode +J then set -J a second later, then repeat the cycle a second later
[05:51] <soreau> (gibbon ;)
[05:52] <vrkhans> any good wma player which is simple and good like vlc
[05:52] <Bossmanbeta> vrkhans, xmms

[05:53]  * regeya /ignores the bots; remember kids, you can ignore the bots and it looks a lot less like a concerted bot attack to flood the channel
[05:53] <Bossmanbeta> vrkhans, there's a plugin for xmms to play wma's
[05:53] <nickrud> vrkhans: with the xmms-wma plugin, it does
[05:53] <soreau> Flannel: I see the max size as the addition of the two drives. YAY!
[05:53] <[chr0n0s]> !ping
[05:53] <ubotu> ping yourself ;-) really the diodes all down my left side are sore
[05:54] <Bossmanbeta> vrkhans,  sudo apt-get install xmms-wma
[05:54] <googlingtingwana> regeya, how to ignore the bots?
[05:54] <yao_ziyuan> i mean realaudio stream
[05:54] <yao_ziyuan> not wma
[05:54] <soreau> Flannel: I hope it has not frozen up on me :(
[05:54] <reZo> looks like im' going to have to turn fsck checks up higher, or off, it's hanging for no reason, the file system is alright :S :(

[05:56] <Fwblean> I've got an old XP box that I want to add Ubuntu to. It's got a single 160gb partition on C: and I want to resize that to make room for Ubuntu, but the partition is very fragmented with files all over the place. How should I go about creating a partition for Ubuntu?
[05:57] <hypomnema> soreau, apparently nobody, and apparently flood channels with -J/+J mode sets =)
[05:57] <Bossmanbeta> there's no 'a' in "experience"
[05:57] <mikesa81> a question about partitioning. I would like to install ubuntu on one partition, and on another i wanted to install kubuntu with kde4, would i have problems if they were both to share a third partition /home ?
[05:57] <googlingtingwana> Zoiks, some, for raid-1 (mirror)
[05:57] <Flannel> mikesa81: You don't have tohave separate installs for that.
[05:57] <mikesa81> i wanted to keep them physically seperated
[05:57] <vrkhans> thansk
[05:57] <hdevalence> mikesa81: don't think so
[05:57] <regeya> hypomnema: I looked it up, and that's join throttling.  though I have no idea why one channel needs three bots to constantly toggle that setting.
[05:57] <pyrak> how do i enable universe from the command line?
[05:57] <pyrak> "terminal"
[05:57] <Flannel> pyrak: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:57] <Fwblean> mikesa81: You can add kubuntu to Ubuntu and swap at the logon screen
[05:57] <vrkhans> what about my other problem
[05:58] <regeya> they're the equivalent of a two year old who's learned how to operate the light switch.
[05:58] <soreau> Flannel: Erm .. I did this and now after 'Finish' it restarts the partitioner at which point I see hmm ...
[05:58] <soreau> sec :D
[05:58] <mneptok> pyrak: remove the # from the beginning of the line with the universe repos
[05:58] <mikesa81> Flannel: i know i can have them both on, i wanted to keep one clean, and screw around with the other
[05:58] <mikesa81> Fwbean: see my msg above
[05:59] <Flannel> mikesa81: the only drawback to sharing a home is that you'll have user configs for each in your homedir, not a big issue at all.
[05:59] <googlingtingwana> soreau, I assume you are using the "alternate" install/live CD, right?
[05:59] <pyrak> mneptok, thanks
[05:59] <pyrak> Flannel++
[05:59] <hdevalence> mikesa81: you could also install KDE4 in the ~ of a seperate user, though you'de be building from SVN not from installing the packages
[05:59] <hdevalence> which is more techinical
[05:59] <hdevalence> and more buggy

[06:09] <hellppmme> Gokee2: im on live cd now my /dev/sda is using dual boot one is my ubuntu old and my winxp, now ive installed winxp and when i boot the laptop it will boot the winxp but no more grub to select which OS to boot,im planning to reinstall ubuntu as well but when im in install program at Preparing Partition i cant see the different partitions but only /dev/sda,how can i select the right partition for my ubuntu then?
[06:09] <soreau> Flannel: I set one partition in LVM group and then the rest of the space becomes labeled as 'unusable' (same if I define the '/' first)
[06:09] <mneptok> nickrud++
[06:09] <nickrud> Mikelevel: which one?
[06:09] <regeya> bwahaha
[06:09] <hdevalence> mikesa81: well, I'm using the trunk right now... it's very nice, but unstable a\nd a bit patchy. Plasma in 4.0 is very bad and so is Kontact. The rest is probably acceptable
[06:09] <nel> quit
[06:10] <nel> #quit
[06:10] <Flannel> soreau: You're talking about logical volumes, right?
[06:10] <soreau> yes
[06:10] <mneptok> nel: /quit
[06:10] <Zoiks> googlingtingwana: it says you dont have to in all the guides, however I normally wait and let it finish anyway
[06:10] <berlylabs> how do people do all these action things
[06:10] <mikesa81> hdevalence: would it be a bad idea to allow those buggy apps access to my /home?
[06:10] <mneptok> berlylabs: /me
[06:10] <Flannel> soreau: You shouldn't have any problem creating more than one in a volume group
[06:10] <regeya> please, nobody get kickbanned over my setting mode +sleep...funny, but don't overdo it.  the ops here have their hands full as it is, and I'm being honest and genuine in that.  y'all have a lot to deal with on the weekend and I salute you.  now stop picking on me j/k
[06:10] <berlylabs> sleep
[06:10] <berlylabs> hmm
[06:10] <soreau> Flannel: hmm ..
[06:11]  * soreau tries
[06:11]  * berlylabs sigh
[06:11] <berlylabs> oh got it
[06:11] <Sumdumguy> whats the best/most widly used c compiler i should use/install  ?
[06:11] <hdevalence> Sumdumguy: gcc
[06:11] <mneptok> Sumdumguy: gcc
[06:11] <Gokee2> hellppmme, I always use the manual configure the partition table
[06:11] <Sumdumguy> thanks
[06:11] <googlingtingwana> Zoiks, new territory for me, but I'm going off to set up a raid-5 set for the first time - what filesystem are you planning to put on it?
[06:11] <mneptok> Sumdumguy: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[06:11] <Sumdumguy> thanks again
[06:12] <Gokee2> hellppmme, If you do that you get a table of all yout partitions and get to choose where to put the ubuntu install
[06:12]  * berlylabs still trying to get help so she can play yahoo games
[06:12] <hellppmme> Gokee2: yes i chose manual configure but still i can ony see /dev/sda and not that partition of my installed winxp which is /dev/sda5 and my oldubuntu which is /dev/sda1 are not there
[06:12] <berlylabs> anyone know how to run IE on wine
[06:13] <usser> !ies4linux
[06:13] <ubotu> ies4linux is a script that quickly and effortlessly helps you install 3 versions of IE in Wine. Information can be found at http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page including instructions specifically for Ubuntu. ies4linux is aimed at web designers and ie-only sites, so please, dont use any of the IEs to navigate! Use Firefox!
[06:13] <hdevalence> mikesa81: I don't think there'll be a problem. Even if something did happen, you could recover from your regular backups, right? :D In any case, I don't think anything bad would happen
[06:13] <berlylabs> ty
[06:13] <Zoiks> googlingtingwana: i have only ever used ext3 with linux
[06:14] <Zoiks> googlingtingwana: you ahve any other suggestions?
[06:14] <monte> how do i get an external hardrive to mount
[06:14] <dangermike> monte do you know the dev name?
[06:14] <Zoiks> monte: fdisk -l
[06:14] <dangermike> dmesg if you dont
[06:14] <Zoiks> which drive is it
[06:14] <tehCurtis> how do i uninstall something?
[06:14] <mikesa81> hdevalence: yeh.. :) i've been meaning to get that set up.. :) any suggestions for some automatic backup?
[06:14] <tehCurtis> i installed nginx and want to remove it
[06:14] <dangermike> tehCurtis sudo apt-get remove xxx
[06:14] <Gokee2> hellppmme, Hmmm you got windows to install on sda5?  I have not been able to make it install on anything other then part 1.  I have not tried in many years though.  I don`t know why your other ones are not listed.  Try cfdisk /dev/sda at a command line and see if that has all your parts
[06:15] <googlingtingwana> Zoiks, I've used reiserfs for years with no problems and good performance - I'm about to give raid-5 a try (wonders of vmware)
[06:15] <nickrud> tehCurtis: sudo apt-get remove pkg
[06:15] <tehCurtis> sweet thanks
[06:15] <op305> noob here tryin to install ubuntu on pc
[06:15] <op305> 1st where to get
[06:15] <op305> ?
[06:15] <Gnutz> ubuntu.com
[06:15] <Bossmanbeta> mikesa81, rsync is on of the best backup tools out there
[06:15] <dangermike> ...
[06:15] <nickrud> op305: releases.ubuntu.com/7.10 , use the torrent if possible
[06:15] <soreau> Flannel: Basically, I need to create now a logical partition. But it wont let me undo the changes I have made or edit anything. Should I reboot it and try again?
[06:16] <CoolBreeze> hey all, i have a security question on vnc: i use a vnc viewer to remote to my ubuntu desktop from my laptop (win xp) in the same house. I port forwarded my router (port 5900) so that i could connect from my work as well. When i got home tonight I noticed there were x2 other users connected and i cut them off right away. How is this possible? I set it so that you have to enter an 8 character pw to take control when you remote i
[06:16] <mikesa81> Bossmanbeta: thanks. i could schedule it
[06:16] <mikesa81> ?
[06:16] <hdevalence> mikesa81: I use rsync, though I use it to do simple things such as  "rsync -aPv /home/harry/ /mnt/voyager6/backup/"
[06:16] <Bossmanbeta> mikesa81, yep
[06:16] <Gnutz> Anyone know why my nfs server would be having connection timeouts?
[06:16] <monte> dangermike: i have no clue i no when i put it in my laptop that it works course it is windows lol but i am trying to move files
[06:16] <Dr_willis> CoolBreeze,  using vnc over the internet without a ssh tunnle is NOT a good idea.
[06:17] <monte> zoiks: wat is that
[06:17] <CoolBreeze> even with a pw enabled?
[06:17] <Sumdumguy> mneptok, thanks again :) I have a new server install, and am missing a LOT of stuff is there a lib package i should install ?
[06:17] <Bossmanbeta> CoolBreeze, first off... never fwd a port for VNC directly............... SSH to your box (on a different port than the default port) and use the -L option is ssh to tunnel VNC encrypted and securely to your box...
[06:17] <Dr_willis> CoolBreeze,  well.. you had 2 other users connected.. :) so logicially YES a password is not enough security
[06:17] <dangermike> monte run dmesg it should be sda/sdb etc
[06:17] <hdevalence> mikesa81: I had it as a cron job which would fail silently if my external drive was not connected
[06:17] <mikesa81> hdevalence:thanks
[06:17] <Zoiks> googlingtingwana: yeah, i have thought about trying others...just was not sure on compatibility and stability and such
[06:18] <mikesa81> Bossmanbeta:thanks
[06:18] <Gnutz> I've heard VNC passwords are also transmitted as plain text.  Is that right?
[06:18] <Dr_willis> CoolBreeze,  time to be viruschecking  and possibially reinstalling that windows box.
[06:18] <CoolBreeze> guys, thanks for the tips. i will apply this logic right away.
[06:18] <mikesa81> hdevalence:cron?
[06:18] <Bossmanbeta> CoolBreeze, also..... on sshd_config DISABLE the permit root login option (set it to 'no') to prevent a hack into ssh and gaining ROOT
[06:18] <berlylabs>     /home/kimberly/.ies4linux/downloads/mfc42.cab: No such file or directory
[06:18] <berlylabs>  An error occured when trying to cabextract some files.
[06:18] <hdevalence> mikesa81: kinda
[06:18] <monte> dangermike: how do i do that
[06:18] <Bossmanbeta> CoolBreeze, you can also configure SSHD to only accept connections from specific IPs to further prevent hack attempts
[06:18] <dangermike> monte open terminal
[06:19] <dangermike> monte and type in dmesg then press enter
[06:19] <hdevalence> mikesa81: I made a custom wrapper script that ran it
[06:19] <Gnutz> Any Mac users in here?  I'm trying to set up my Ubuntu machine as a backup device for Time Machine, but so far no luck.  Can't tell if it's a client or server issue.
[06:19] <Bossmanbeta> CoolBreeze, while you're at it... set up a honeypot and and then get their IPs and write their ISP about their evil doings
[06:20] <monte> dangermike: it says cannot be found
[06:21] <storm-ze1> I need some help configuring firestarter for samba.  I'm pretty sure it's firewall related, because when I drop it (which I later determined I don't really want to do again), it works like a charm... But adding the networks to "allow connections from host" or the ports to "Allow service" section (with or without network restriction) doesn't work.
[06:21] <dangermike> monte dmesg its there trust me
[06:21] <op305> thnx nickrud gnutz
[06:21] <tehCurtis> ack! the uninstall failed!
[06:21] <tehCurtis> Stopping nginx: invoke-rc.d: initscript nginx, action "stop" failed.
[06:21] <monte> dangermike: i put a q sorry lol
[06:21] <tehCurtis> did i do something wrong?
[06:21] <dangermike> tehCurtis what happened
[06:21] <tehCurtis> dpkg: error processing nginx (--remove):
[06:21] <tehCurtis> then
[06:22] <tehCurtis> eventually
[06:22] <tehCurtis> E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[06:22] <monte> dangermike: i have it up
[06:22] <Bossmanbeta> anyone aware of a way of detaching a remote X application running via 'ssh -Y' for re-attaching later? (Just like 'screen' but for X apps) There's an old-old app called 'xmove' (last updated 1997) but it's very buggy and doesn't work. VNC and NX are whole-desktop solutions and doesn't work well when I want to run local & remote apps on a unified local desktop.
[06:22] <nickrud> tehCurtis: probably not, unless you deleted /etc/nginx (or whatever the config file is located)
[06:22] <Dr_willis> Bossmanbeta,  try asking in ##linux :)
[06:22] <dangermike> monte you should have a usb section at the bottom copy the last 10 or so lines and PM them to me
[06:22] <tehCurtis> i didn't manually removing anything yet
[06:22] <Bossmanbeta> Dr_willis, sure... beggars can't be choosers :-)
[06:22] <hellppmme> Gokee2_: and this is something cuz when i click PLaces then Computer i can see the partitions
[06:23] <dangermike> tehCurtis you may want to try opening synaptics and removing from there
[06:23] <tehCurtis> i just think i have more than one install so i was trying to remove the one i added via apt
[06:23] <tehCurtis> k
[06:23] <nickrud> tehCurtis: put up on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org the complete error
[06:23] <Dr_willis> Bossmanbeta,  id like to see how it could be done :)
[06:23] <Bossmanbeta> Dr_willis, but I'll continue to ask at regular intervals.... you never know when master yoda of the ssh-clan of the clan McCloud should ever waltz in :)

[06:24] <Bossmanbeta> lol
[06:24] <mikesa81> hdevalence: running trunk, does that update your machine pretty much daily? or you have to checkout from svn everytime and build everytime you want to update?
[06:24] <hellppmme> im sorry my sda1 is my winxp and my sda5 is my linux
[06:24] <Bossmanbeta> Perhaps I should start in #Gentoo ... all those compiler-geeks
[06:24] <Gokee2_> hellppmme, Hmm then I don`t know why they would be missing from the installer
[06:24] <nickrud> tehCurtis: now the contents of /var/lib/dpkg/info/nginx.prerm
[06:24] <hellppmme> bugs perhaps
[06:24] <nickrud> tehCurtis: that's the script that's failing
[06:24] <hellppmme> let me restart my laptop
[06:24] <hellppmme> brb
[06:25] <tehCurtis> k
[06:25] <hellppmme> ill load again the livecd
[06:25] <Bossmanbeta> Dr_willis, but these days .. Ubuntu is like jupiter with a huge gravitational pull ... all the other distros pale in scale... except maybe fedora/redhat
[06:26] <googlingtingwana> Zoiks, it's recovering at the moment, but I need to reboot to have the kernel re-read the partition table after the recovery is finished
[06:26] <tehCurtis> nickrud: nothing in there
[06:27] <Zoiks> googlingtingwana: ok
[06:27] <Zoiks> googlingtingwana: my hard drive just started beeping... freaking me out
[06:27] <Zoiks> lol
[06:27] <Bossmanbeta> hard drives dont beep
[06:27] <Bossmanbeta> ...system speakers do...
[06:27] <Zoiks> lol this did

[06:28] <tehCurtis> ah
[06:28] <tehCurtis> found it
[06:28] <googlingtingwana> Zoiks, when the recovery finished, the status changed from 3/2 (UU_) to 3/3 (UUU)

[06:34] <googlingtingwana> Zoiks, I've rebooted and created an ext3 file system on the new raid set
