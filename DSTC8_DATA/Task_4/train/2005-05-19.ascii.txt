[08:36] <mole_> I'm having difficulty getting my Palm Tungsten T to reliably synchronise with gnome-pilot and evolution.  I'm using hoary with the latest updates.   I can get working as a one-off using the instructions at ubuntuguide.org, but being able to do it consistently is a problem.  gpilotd just doesn't seem to be able to see the udev device for the palm unless I have the configuration window open in evolution (gpilotd-control).  The gnome apple
[08:36] <mole_> t frontend to gpilotd also doesn't appear to work.  Anyone else having trouble with this?

[08:36] <chris_ubuntu> dabaSlon: Yes, but that doesn't make sense.  Why would I want this to be bootable if it is a slave backup space?
[08:37] <bluemax> ok, i'm trying to connect to a nsv stream (at a url) but it's almost always full, so i have to have it loop in mplayer but i don't know how
[08:37] <dabaSlon> cause it wants you to:)
[08:37] <bluemax> #mplayer is dead so i thought i'd ask here
[08:37] <chris_ubuntu> dabaSlon: by bootable, I am understanding that this is where the OS sits and boots from.  Is this incorrect?
[08:37] <dabaSlon> pls try it, chris...
[08:38] <dabaSlon> im dying to know if it works...
[08:38] <dabaSlon> to answer your question, yes...
[08:38] <IIIEars> chris_ubuntu - no need for a bootable flag if you will only use it for storage
[08:38] <ryman> whats the command to check system up time ?
[08:38] <crimsun> ,,uptime''
[08:38] <dabaSlon> IIIEars: did you read the pastebin?
[08:38] <chris_ubuntu> yes, seems to have written.  So my above understanding is incorrect?
[08:38] <dabaSlon> it is correct.
[08:39] <dabaSlon> it would only seem that a hard drive does not like to be formatted without a bootable partition.
[08:39] <dabaSlon> ok, let us mount that baby, then...
[08:39] <ryman> crimsun, thank you
[08:39] <dabaSlon> so, it is hdb1?
[08:39] <IIIEars> yes - what did i miss? - it is complaining that it can't be booted from but that is no problem for windows to see it.
[08:39] <chris_ubuntu> hang on.  Let me see
[08:39] <metalsand2> crimsun: what do I do know?

[08:40] <dabaSlon> is it hdb1?

[08:41] <ryman> how do I make a dir in computer ?
[08:41] <chris_ubuntu> dabaSlon: Windows?  This is a ubuntu box.
[08:41] <crimsun> metalsand2: are you running 0.2.1-pre26? I never saw absolute confirmation from you.
[08:41] <dabaSlon> sudo mount /dev/hd1 /media/relmp3/
[08:41] <metalsand2> crimsun: That's what I installed from
[08:42] <dabaSlon> chris, you worry too much, for one, you will have a haeart attack...
[08:42] <dabaSlon> second, I was speaking to IIIEars
[08:42] <metalsand2> I know I unziped that file, went to that directory and made the module from that directory
[08:42] <dabaSlon> nothing related to youl
[08:42] <crimsun> metalsand2: if you can confirm from the filename, fine.
[08:42] <dabaSlon> ryman: what ditr?
[08:42] <dabaSlon> mkdir?
[08:42] <dabaSlon> through gnome?

[08:44] <ryman> I want to make a folder in that place
[08:44] <dabaSlon> copy and paste those into your terminal.
[08:44] <IIIEars> Chris_ubuntu - you won't need a bootable parttion to use that drive as storage. format it in a filetype that the OS you choose will understand and you're done. - :)
[08:44] <ryman> but I don't know waht dir is the Places - Computer
[08:44] <dabaSlon> ok, you need tro be root to do that, ryman,..

[09:52] <metalsand> Sweet - my next problem
[09:52] <Seveas> scaling is ok
[09:52] <Cybermagellan> I locked it this time
[09:52] <Seveas> "ubuntu" looks crappy so close to the logo
[09:52] <Seveas> and powered by is too small
[09:52] <metalsand> FATAL: Unable to open cisco control file '/proc/driver/aironet/eth0/Config' 2:No such file or directory
[09:52] <Cybermagellan> I can't think of anywhere else to put it
[09:52] <Seveas> next to the logo is better
[09:53] <Seveas> as in powered by (LOGO) Ubuntu
[09:53] <pablo921> Cybermagellan: look ok to me
[09:53] <ivoks> Seveas eth0?
[09:53] <ivoks> sorry
[09:53] <ivoks> metalsand eth0? isn't your wlan on wlan0?
[09:53] <metalsand> kismet is trying to run off of eth0, not wlan0 it seems
[09:53] <ivoks> metalsand configure kismet
[09:53] <ivoks> bye all
[09:53] <metalsand> Yeah, I've never bothered trying to run it since my card never worked
[09:54] <Q_Continuum> metalsand, whenever I've had that happen (I'm using ndiswrapper) it's because i need todo another modprobe ndiswrapper
[09:54] <Q_Continuum> which fixes it

[10:00] <bob2> jackass: you can't mount .bin files
[10:00] <pablo921> Cybermagellan:, i think it looks fine
[10:00] <bob2> jackass: use bchunk to convert it to a useful format
[10:00] <jackass> :( okey
[10:00] <Seveas> Cybermagellan, indeed, but the font is awfully small compared to the logo size imho
[10:00] <jackass> wheres bchunk? where can i find it.
[10:00] <Cybermagellan> Well I was going to suggest that this be at the bottom of a webpage...so I don't wanna make it too large....nor too small
[10:01] <{Cricket}> jackass google for it
[10:01] <Cybermagellan> Like the powered by apache logo
[10:01] <bob2> jackass: wiki.ubuntu.com/SynapticHowto, enable universe

[10:10] <bob2> jackass: run "man bchunk" in a terminal, and read it
[10:10] <Cybermagellan> Seveas, so maybe something like this? http://68.231.152.140:8080/apache2-default/poweredby2.png

[10:10] <jackass> no manual post for bchunk:S!

[10:48] <REdz> helloyo, dvdrtools udftools dvdplusrw, just do sudo apt-cache search dvd| more and have a loook
[10:48] <geoffroy_> I just installed 5.04
[10:48] <Seveas> geoffroy_, welcome aboard the Ubuntu ship then :)
[10:49] <Daehlie> 5.04!@!@ You just said our word of the day!@!
[10:49] <geoffroy_> thank you
[10:49] <Daehlie> ding ding ding
[10:49] <geoffroy_> but I was on 4.10 before
[10:49] <helloyo> REdz, thanks a lot
[10:49] <Seveas> :)
[10:49] <Seveas> well, welcome on the hoary ship ;)
[10:49] <geoffroy_> and i don't understand why the system is asking me a password for changing configuration etc...
[10:49] <helloyo> REdz, just trying to get my brother to stop being a dick about windows detecting it straight away
[10:49] <geoffroy_> is it not supposed to be the superuser pass ?
[10:49] <Seveas> geoffroy_, no
[10:49] <Seveas> it needs your password since ubuntu uses sudo
[10:50] <geoffroy_> oh my god, I missed something
[10:50] <eruin> geoffroy_: you _are_ the superuser, effectively speaking
[10:50] <Seveas> geoffroy_, http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
[10:50] <Seveas> that'll explain a lot :)

[10:53] <Seveas> lewwy, they just forget to mention the "in some cases" part

[10:55] <webmind> daniels, ok
[10:55] <geoffroy_> okay, I missed something during the installation
[10:55] <webmind> daniels, also on the amd64 then ?
[10:55] <helloyo> REdz, i have been reading that site, and i still can't get anything happening
[10:55] <geoffroy_> because my first user is not in the sudoers
[10:55] <daniels> webmind: yeah
[10:55] <webmind> cool :)

[10:56] <daniels> it would probably also work better if you actually bought the game
[10:56] <geoffroy_> Should I have to reinstall ? or is there any solution without running installation again
[10:56] <REdz> helloyo, did u check /etc/fstab and dmesg
[10:56] <Seveas> geoffroy_, this has changed in hoary
[10:56] <lewwy> its already cracked REdz
[10:56] <geoffroy_> oh ?
[10:56] <REdz> and is ur usb working helloyo
[10:56] <REdz> lewwy, ok
[10:56] <lewwy> i just run it, and it tries to init, and then dies
[10:56] <helloyo> REdz, dmesg says that it found a removable scsi disk sda at scsi0
[10:57] <lewwy> could the fact that im running it on RO filesystem affect it?
[10:57] <REdz> helloyo, thats a good thing, wat about fstab
[10:57] <helloyo> doesn't say anything about it
[10:57] <REdz> lewwy, ye i read up on that at some places for diablo2
[10:57] <REdz> not sure if its related
[10:58] <lewwy> mmm
[10:58] <lewwy> is captive-ntfs supposed to support r/w
[10:58] <helloyo> REdz, no entry for it in fstab
[10:58] <REdz> helloyo, well ye u prob need that in there first
[10:59] <REdz> and install some of those tools and start up k3b after that
[10:59] <geoffroy_> Can't I had my first user to sudoers ?
[11:00] <Taliesin`> your first user (the one you create on install) is in sudoers
[11:00] <geoffroy_> that is the problem
[11:00] <Taliesin`> u dont want it in sudoers?
[11:00] <geoffroy_> My first user, the one I created during install doesnt appear in sudoers file
[11:01] <Taliesin`> oh buggery
[11:01] <geoffroy_> Sorry, user geoffroy may not run sudo on
[11:01] <lewwy> hey is there anyway i can possibly force an unmount of a cd drive?

[11:02] <lewwy> if its mounted and semi in use
[11:02] <lewwy> you cant eject it
[11:02] <Taliesin`> i never seem to have a problem
[11:02] <lewwy> why can windows do this so easily?
[11:03] <lewwy> no, im in the middle of a raven shield install
[11:03] <lewwy> i ran cedega Setup.exe
[11:03] <geoffroy_> Could you paste your file /etc/sudoers please ?
[11:03] <Taliesin`> windows doesnt take control of the cdrom
[11:03] <Taliesin`> linux appears to take control of it at a more hardware level
[11:03] <lewwy> but...whats the benefit of that?
[11:03] <Taliesin`> nfi, it just works for me
[11:03] <lewwy> and why can't i just say "i really need that CD, emergency eject"
[11:03] <Taliesin`> the only rare case i use umount -f is when i incorrectly burn a CD
[11:03] <lewwy> yeh
[11:04] <lewwy> but i got an install running off the CD
[11:04] <lewwy> and it wont take it
[11:06] <geoffroy_> Ok I think that it works
[11:06] <geoffroy_> how can i config the pass for sudo ?
