[00:58] <Bruha> I login at the prompt, but then it just goes to a terminal prompt cbruhn@ubuntu:
[00:58] <Bruha> isn't there a graphical interface for server?
[00:59] <MrXXIV2> Bruha: no Ubuntu Server has always been just a terminal, BUT you can install a GUI
[00:59] <MrXXIV2> Consider Server to be the barebone version
[00:59] <Bruha> ah ok
[00:59] <Bruha> how do i do that?
[00:59] <Bruha> now I can install somethign like Plex over the top?
[00:59] <MrXXIV2> Are you just doing an at-home VM for Ubuntu?
[01:00] <Bruha> I have a second computer that I want to put Plex on now
[01:00] <Bruha> for a home media server
[01:00] <MrXXIV2> Oh, yea, if you wanted to go that route, you might as well stick to the terminal version just to install Plex being that will handle it all for you in the long run
[01:00] <Bruha> ok
[01:00] <Bruha> can you help me with that?
[01:00] <Bruha> shit
[01:00] <ikonia> Bruha: please don't swear

[01:18] <Crushpest> debian
[01:18] <rww> then don't ask in here, thanks
[01:18] <rww> we handle Ubuntu users, #debian handles Debian ones
[01:18] <rww> (and in general, crossposting your question to multiple channels tends to be considered rude)
[01:19] <Crushpest> well it's the same. i used brctl from bridge-utils that is in both distris
[01:19] <amazoniantoad> rww: I thought ubuntu was based on debian?
[01:19] <rww> Doesn't matter. That's how we split the load, so ask them.
[01:19] <amazoniantoad> (excuse my ignorance)
[01:19] <rww> amazoniantoad: correct
[01:19] <amazoniantoad> So there are debian questions that aren't valid in ubuntu?
[01:19] <daftykins> amazoniantoad: doesn't mean you can channel hop for support depending on your mood
[01:20] <amazoniantoad> Something really niche?
[01:20] <amazoniantoad> I see
[01:20] <brug> rude
[01:20] <daftykins> channel name for distro name, deal with it.
[01:20] <rww> amazoniantoad: Debian users go to #debian, Ubuntu users go to #ubuntu. It's not a complicated system :P
[01:20] <amazoniantoad> I didn't mean it like that! I just didn't know debian was its own distro
[01:20] <rww> and Ubuntu derivative users like Mint or whatever go to their distro's support channel
[01:20] <rww> yep
[01:21] <amazoniantoad> I thought it was more like a kernel or something...like linux

[02:59] <tomreyn> auzty: not those of your ubuntu release
[02:59] <teward> auzty: http://askubuntu.com/questions/151283/why-dont-the-ubuntu-repositories-have-the-latest-versions-of-software
[02:59] <tomreyn> 1.4.6-1ubuntu3.3 is the latest version available for 14.04.4 (trusty)
[02:59] <teward> auzty: the 1.9.x upload went to the current development branc
[03:00] <teward> h
[03:00] <teward> bleh
[03:00] <xangua> sw0rdfish: no, you have to download separate iso, Ubuntu GNOME, Ubuntu Mate, Ubuntu, Xubuntu, etc.
[03:00] <auzty> ohhhh iseee, thanks teward  and tomreyn :)
[03:00] <teward> auzty: given that I'm the one that uploaded it, I can confirm that with 100% accuracy.  The 14.04 repos only have 1.4.x in them for nginx; I provide a PPA though with newer versions
[03:00] <tomreyn> you can probably find unsupported (by canonical and the ubuntu community) nginx backports though
[03:00] <teward> but of course the obligatory factoid applies

[03:11] <auzty> thanks teward, that's really helpful, i didn't know that every ubuntu release have their own latest update :D
[03:12] <teward> auzty: well, there's the main release repository (trusty), updates in -updates, and security updates in -security :p
[03:12] <teward> auzty: there's a reason i love that link myself, but as I said, I'm the one who did the latest upload for nginx to Ubuntu, so... i use whatever I want :)
[03:15] <basttrax> auzty, I think with programs like nginx people aren't really in a rush to get to the most cutting edge version
[03:20] <auzty> wow :) thanks again teward , maybe i still get the other OS minded that always need the most cutting edge version basttrax , haha thanks :D
[03:21] <teward> auzty: well, hate to put it out there, but as I did say, I provide a PPA through the nginx team on Launchpad for latest stable and mainline, but the obligatory PPA notice from earlier applies: https://launchpad.net/~nginx/+archive/ubuntu/stable for NGINX Stable; https://launchpad.net/~nginx/+archive/ubuntu/development for mainline

[03:23] <auzty> ok i already do it teward , and now my nginx 1.8.0 from your ppa :D thanks a lot

[04:09] <hbar98> cfhowlett, sorry, this may be ubuntu specific.
[04:09] <cfhowlett> hbar98, no worries.  interesting question.  Hope someone knows.
[04:10] <hbar98> cfhowlett, gratzi! I hope so! It is annoing as heck.
[04:10] <greyscale> Hmm, mine actually DOES do as you're describing
[04:10] <greyscale> I thought that was default behaviour.
[04:10] <hbar98> It may be. It did this on windows, but I found a registry hack that sort of worked.
[04:10] <greyscale> I enable tethering on my HTC One or One Plus and the computer connects when USB is present
[04:10] <nicomachus> ^ same
[04:10] <nicomachus> with HTC One

[04:12] <hbar98> I wouldn't mind that it creates multiple networks if it would just auto connect.

[04:15] <codepython777> I was looking at something around $1k - XPS and T550 both are more expensive if i want to get a decent i5 or i7
[04:16] <codepython777> greyscale: W550?
[04:17] <greyscale> T550
[04:17] <greyscale> its a nice laptop.
[04:17] <hbar98> greyscale, any ideas how to make it just auto connect? I don't care if it makes multiple networks, just as long as it just autoconnects.
[04:17] <greyscale> hbar98: sorry, I don't.. Mine -does- autoconnect, so I don't know whats different about yours
[04:18] <greyscale> Go edit the connection and see if there is an option for allowing autoconnection?
[04:18] <hbar98> heh, mine's a motorola. they do things backwards.
[04:20] <hbar98> what...the...heck. each connection has a unique MAC address, and only the current one has an eth number thing after it. How in the world??
[04:20] <hbar98> I'm the only one who plugs my phone into the machine.
[04:26] <tgm4883> hbar98: it gets the MAC from the phone
[04:27] <hbar98> Okay, I might have a lead on that. Bonus question: can someone point me in the right direction so I can learn how to bond connections? My wife and I both can tether/wifi tether. It would be nice to bond both connections and send that to the router.
[04:27] <hbar98> tgm4883, yeah, I just stumbled on that. I'm going to see if there's a fix for the USB side. Found sever for wifi mac addresses, just not usb yet.
[04:27] <mikhael_k33hl> Confirmed that I'm using the right Name Server, however it appears that hostname resolution is intermittent, sometimes I can ping it via the hostname sometimes it says "unknown host", anyone experienced this?

[06:30] <snacks> or boot straight to tty in the meanwhile
[06:31] <snacks> actually, I finally have access to a browser right now, nvm on that last one

[06:31] <snacks> a low second level?
[06:31] <snacks> what's that?

[06:34] <snacks> Poindexter: because I have zero problems once I log in, even if I leave it until it goes into sleep mode
[06:35] <Poindexter_> Then boil it down to your login screen saver and check that.

[06:36] <snacks> actually, how would I check that in files? I'm booted from a live USB right now, so I can't do much except change text files.
[06:37] <Poindexter_> The live USB disk you cannot change the settings because it is hard written on the disk.
[06:37] <techvish81> is there a problem with suspend to ram in xubuntu?
[06:37] <snacks> Poindexter: I'm not talking about changing the live USB's settings, I'm talking about using the live USB to boot the thing, so I can modify the original OS's settings.
[06:38] <snacks> Poindexter: Because I can't actually boot my original OS, thus the problem.
[06:38] <Poindexter_> Do a Google and you may find the answer.
[06:38] <Poindexter_> Oh.
[06:38] <Poindexter_> That is another story.
[06:38] <smacktalk> j #ccie
[06:39] <Poindexter_> Boot it from what? Your USB or what, your local hard drive?
[06:40] <Poindexter_> Are you running a laptop or a desktop or server?
[06:40] <snacks> Poindexter: boot from USB, so that I can modify local hard drive files.
[06:40] <snacks> laptop
[06:40] <Poindexter_> Ok latptop
[06:40] <Poindexter_> Have you been in the
[06:41] <Poindexter_> BIOS lately?
[06:41] <snacks> everything was working fine until an Ubuntu update broke it. So, it wasn't the BIOS.
[06:42] <snacks> also, goddamn BIOS. goddamn secure-boot, goddamn fastboot, and goddamn intel and Microsoft for coming up with UEFI.
[06:42] <Poindexter_> Now you are talking. So you apt-get an update and all happened from there.
[06:43] <snacks> Poindexter: No, nothing bad happened until the next time I restarted the computer, which I don't do too often.
[06:43] <Poindexter_> Don't apt-get anything unless you MD 5 it.
[06:44] <snacks> Poindexter: I tried switching to a previous kernel version, but that didn't change anything, so it's probably not the kernel.
[06:44] <snacks> Poindexter: How do you MD5 stuff?
[06:45] <Poindexter_> My advice is this, unless you have anything valuable on the hard drive, trash it and do an DOD destruction of the data bits on your hard drive and re-install the Operating System. I do this all of the time and you and many people out ther don
[06:45] <snacks> Poindexter: The problem is, having a vague notion of what *caused* the problem, isn't the same as knowing what to fix to make my laptop boot properly.
[06:45] <Poindexter_> t
[06:46] <Poindexter_> Know that a clean hard disk is best.
[06:46] <marion> is there a simple way to overclock my processor in without editing the .txt file
[06:47] <snacks> Poindexter: I really don't want to have to reinstall. Especially if the problem is the latest version of lightdm, which updating would reinstall, thus re-causing my problem.
[06:48] <Poindexter_> If you try to install a new OS on a disk that is not clean hackers use software or code to be specific to infiltrate your disk by using hidden signals to data that you did not erase. That  is bad.
[06:50] <snacks> Poindexter: Which is irrelevant, because I doubt this was caused by any sort of malware and as I said previously, I don't want to reinstall if possible.
[06:50] <snacks> I'd have to reinstall everything, and re-copy everything over, which would be a huge waste of time and wouldnt necessarily solve the problem.
[06:52] <Poindexter_> Snaks, don't be lazy. Reinstallation is easy maybe because I have in front of me 30 different computers. I say this easily, but take it from a pro. I don't fool around with this. Have may computers in front of you and don't rely on just one computer. Not all computers respond to each OS installed.
[06:52] <Poindexter_> Snacks you also need to know how to mirror image your OS after a DOD cleansing.
[06:54] <Poindexter_> Snacks, I am a DATA RECOVERY EXPERT. I have been doing this for years. There are things to know about the computer that you cannot learn from a book.
[06:57] <dekr4ken> i am a cleaner
[06:57] <GenericNode> do you do wet work?
[06:57] <dekr4ken> no, corp calls, i go clean up the mess.
[06:58] <snacks> Poindexter: It's not about being lazy, it's about not to use an axe when you can use a scalpel. Also, I seriously suspect that reinstalling will not actually fix the problem, as if it is a broken package, then reinstalling will just replace the broken package with a broken package, fixing NOTHING.
[06:59] <nicomachus> snacks: what's your original issue?
[06:59] <Poindexter_> Snacks, if you reason with what you just said, the "package" is corrupted. Have you tried downloading the package from another source?
=== Tronsha is now known as [UPA]Stefan
[07:02] <nicomachus> does the whole PC crash or does it just go to a black screen with a cursor?
[07:02] <Poindexter_> Snacks, 1 second is not enough time to make any decisions to make settings. I already explained that.
[07:03] <snacks> nicomachus: black screen, no cursor. IIRC.
[07:03] <dekr4ken> i would uninstall the packages, verify authenticity of packages MD5 file from another resource, install it, and see what happens. if it still breaks the system, then there is not much you can do about it. backup and begin from scratch. simple backups of vm's before updates is basics101, if it fails, take it off and place the original back

[07:03] <nicomachus> snacks: can you boot from a live USB?
[07:03] <snacks> Poindexter: It's enough to hit ctrl+alt+F2.
[07:03] <snacks> nicomachus: How do you think I'm on IRC right now? Live USB.
[07:04] <nicomachus> Ok. Did you run boot-repair?
[07:04] <snacks> nicomachus: Nope, in fact I've never heard of boot-repair before.
[07:05] <nicomachus> snacks: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[07:06] <nicomachus> snacks: give that a run, and see if it resolves the issue. If not you can check /var/log/lightdm and see if it points to what's causing the crash.
[07:07] <Poindexter_> Nicomachus, I suggested the same thing and once his OS is running, go to the /var/log/lightdm or any settings to reset the time delay of the screen saver in which is his problem.
[07:09] <nicomachus> Poindexter_: it's clearly not a screen saver issue whatsoever. and the more you talk about how you're a "pro" and continue to give bad advice, the less likely people are to pay attention to it.
[07:10] <Poindexter_> Nicomachus, really? His issue was from the beginning the screen saver and not being able to log in and having a blank screen.
=== nano is now known as Guest75990
=== Guest75990 is now known as citroniks
[07:11] <nicomachus> that's not a screen saver... it's the display manager crashing.
[07:11] <auronandace1> Poindexter_: if the login manager had a screensaver then simply moving the mouse would bring the login manager back
[07:12] <snacks> Poindexter: when did I say anything about a screensaver problem?
[07:12] <f8mf8_> Hi here is a screenshot of a byobu/tmux issue I've been trying to fix on my ubuntu server http://i.imgur.com/AZDdCnb.png
[07:12] <Poindexter_> Moving the mouse would bring it back but if the setting were 1 second, that would be useless.
[07:12] <nicomachus> snacks: did you install boot-repair?
[07:13] <auronandace1> Poindexter_: you did notice that he said he couldn't bring it back right?
[07:13] <[Saint]> On what Ubunt-ism is there a screensaver on the login screen? Screen blanking, sure...

[07:13] <Poindexter_> I saw it.
[07:13] <auronandace> Poindexter_: then it isn't a screensaver issue

[07:15] <nicomachus> [Saint], Poindexter_, drop it or take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
[07:15] <f8mf8> I know, but figured I might get help here since the server where the issue happens is ubuntu 14.04

[07:16] <f8mf8> It had an old version of byobu 5.74 and old tmux as well. Updated tmux and that fixed the issue when launching tmux on its own, but byobu still having issues

[08:42] <snacks> is it possible to configure systemd via files, rather than via commandline? Or alternatively, how do I configure the systemd on my hard-drive when I'm booted from a Live USB?
[08:44] <auronandace> snacks: not sure sorry, but if you need to configure it via commands then you'll likely need to chroot from your usb

[08:44] <ubottu> snacks: A chroot is used to make programs believe that the directory they are running in is really the root directory.

[08:53] <bekks> Trinity: If so, you cannot hide them.
[08:53] <bekks> AppAraat: It wont work that way.

[09:25] <bekks> AppAraat: You said you would mirror the laptops using the ethernet port. So you actually have a wired network.
[09:25] <AppAraat> well, in the sense that I can directly have a cable between one laptop and another.
[09:25] <J-BBB> anyone have the latest truecrypt .deb?
[09:25] <AppAraat> I do have a patch chord for that.
[09:25] <bekks> AppAraat: Which is called "a wired network".
[09:26] <bekks> Plug in a 8-port switch for $20, and you can stage 7 laptops at a time. E.g.
[09:27] <cfhowlett> J-BBB, truecrypt is abandonware.  veracrypt is the currently maintained fork
[09:27] <AppAraat> bekks: I'm kind of confused, you said it was not possible using this method.

[09:41] <auronandace> poops: read the link, but it will be more straightforward installing afresh
[09:41] <poops> thanks, ill read the link
[09:42] <poops> not in the upgradfe path
[09:43] <BigBaby> cfhowlett, chroot is not working, giving me error, can you verify for me the chroot command?
[09:43] <cfhowlett> poops, torrent the LTS version, make a boot USB and install.
[09:43] <poops> i do have the iso, but when booting from it it didnt suggest an option to upgrade
[09:43] <cfhowlett> BigBaby, not a chroot expert.  direct your query to the channel, someone will know
[09:44] <cfhowlett> poops, it shouldn't.  your EOL options are dead unless you enable end of life which would mean 10.10 > 11.04 > 11.10 > 12.04 > 14.04

[09:46] <cfhowlett> poops, this means you have to upgrade 4! times to get to 14.04.  OR you could just torrent 14.04 and clean install ONE time.  Your box, your choice.
[09:47] <auronandace> poops: if you already have legacy stuff on 10.10 then don't expect an upgrade to go smothly (let alone 4 consecutive upgrades). in the end it will take a lot longer sorting it out than simply installing afresh
[09:47] <poops> could be. i think its worth a shot
[09:47] <poops> always have snapshot revert..
[09:48] <cfhowlett> poops also to be consider: you have an older box.  new ubuntu might just be too demanding. consider lubuntu or xubuntu

[10:03] <lbelo> how can i sync time between two  ubuntu and debian machine?have the same tim zone and date?
[10:18] <jacekn> lbelo: normally it's best to just run NTP and sync both of those machines with good external time source
[10:18] <jacekn> lbelo: but if you really only want both to be in sync you can run NTP server yourself on one of them and sync the other one to it (but I really don't recommend doing this)
[10:19] <lbelo> jacekn: did i installed in both of machines NTP?
[10:20] <ikonia> syncing clock against each other like that will cause problems
[10:20] <ikonia> as drift will be synced, creating bigger drift, that will be synced back
[10:20] <ikonia> eventually it will go beyond the 5 minute threshold and the internal clock will take over
[10:21] <lbelo> ikonia:so what is the best solution?
[10:22] <ikonia> to use a use a set of external time services to the machines
[10:22] <ikonia> 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 needs to be an odd number to stop conflict/split brain
[10:22] <ikonia> (3 is the norm)
[10:22] <jacekn> lbelo: here is some info how to configure them: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html
[10:26] <lbelo> ikonia:i am sorry  just i am not advanced user  how can i set of external time services to the machines infact i have already installed NTP can you tell me detail
[10:26] <aotea> Why can't I boot my live USB to my UEFI system, I
[10:26] <gderou> Hi All
[10:26] <aotea> 've tried both enabled and diabled EFI mode
[10:26] <ikonia> lbelo: are these machines connected to the internet ?
[10:27] <lbelo> ikonia:yes they are connected  one of machine is  vertual machine which is instaalled in the same machine
[10:28] <gderou> I am wondering if it is possible to install (like proper install, not simply Live USB) Ubuntu on a USB stick and be able to boot it on any computer (at least PC and Mac)
[10:28] <ikonia> lbelo: just configure the ntp client to point at the public pool of ntp servers on ntp.org
[10:28] <ikonia> gderou: yes and no
[10:28] <ikonia> gderou: you'd find it better to use livemedia though
[10:29] <gderou> ikonia: thanks. Why is it so ?
[10:30] <ikonia> gderou: because different machines have different hardware, not all of it of it is on the fly changes, live media attempts to configure fail safe settings on boot, a static install will have limitations around that,
[10:30] <lbelo> ikonia:you mean i can installed on both machine and change the ntp.org acording to my country code https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-time-synchronization-on-ubuntu-12-04
[10:31] <ikonia> lbelo: that will work
[10:34] <gderou> ikonia: that makes sense - is there anything lost from a user's perspective when using livemedia (assuming I am using persistence like described in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD/Persistence) ?
[10:34] <ikonia> gderou: some functions will be a little slower, remember your whole OS is running from ram, but nothing is "lost"
[10:34] <ikonia> gderou: is there a reason you need this approach rather than just installing and using ubuntu on a machine ?
[10:36] <lbelo> ikonia:i did it but when i see by date command they are not the same even the timezone
[10:37] <gderou> ikonia: yes, I would like a secure (everything on a truecrypt volume is enough) environment that I could use from anywhere (not necessarily my own computer).
[10:37] <ikonia> lbelo: ntp doesn't set the time zone
[10:37] <ikonia> it just syncs the clock
[10:38] <gderou> ikonia: most of the time I would be using my computer, but I want to be able to use any
[10:38] <ikonia> gderou: I think the idea is bad, but if it's what you want, go for it
[10:39] <gderou> ikonia: why is it bad ?
[10:39] <ikonia> I think the idea is poor and a waste of time, but it's your time to use
[10:41] <aotea> I formatted a USB using KDE partition manager, to ext4, installed a Kubuntu 15.10 64bit on it using Startup Disk Creator. How come my computer won't allow me to boot live usb, system is UEFI but I've tried both enabling and disabling it. Can't find a "Boot Legacy" option but "USB legacy" is ticked as enabled.
[10:42] <lin_lin13> hello ,everyone !
[10:47] <gderou> ikonia: sorry to insist, but what do you think is poor ? Alternatively, are there any options to make a development system leave no trace, and not be attached to a physical machine (I don't want my "less secure" OS installs be able to access in any way the data so putting everything in a VM is not a solution either).
[10:47] <alexla> star wars
[10:47] <ikonia> gderou: just do what you want

[10:48] <gderou> ikonia: ok - sorry to have bothered you - thanks for your help
[10:48] <ikonia> gderou: no problem, just because I don't like it, doesn't mean it's not right for you
[10:51] <gderou> ikonia: I like the iea of having a fully portable OS install not tied to any hardware configuration, but I also fully understand the technical limitations (mostly performance related) that it implies - but this won't hurt me considering what I want to do.
[10:52] <gderou> ikonia: this would be linited to a single security sensitive project - not as a main all purpose commputer
[10:53] <gderou> ikonia: but again if you are aware of alternativess options do do the same thing, please let me know
[10:53] <ikonia> gderou: I think the whole concept is a terrible idea, so there are not alternatives, if it works for you, thats great

[14:15] <tzanolo> hello
[14:15] <tzanolo> googd mornign
[14:15] <Gnomethrower> hi
[14:15] <tzanolo> I have just a issue with ubuntu15 keyborard. the numerical keyboard has a 'dot' key, but when I press it, it types a COMMA. everithing else at the keyboard is ok.
[14:16] <tzanolo> is there a way to just change this only key? i've tried a lot of keyboards at system configuration, no one is good.
[14:18] <Zeaal> hi..
[14:18] <Zeaal> I'm really in need of some help here -.-
[14:19] <tzanolo> anyone
[14:19] <Zeaal> i have 2 drives on my system.. C & D and I use windows
[14:19] <Zeaal> so i installed Ubuntu on drive E (created a parition in it)
[14:20] <Zeaal> now the problem is the i cant boot into ubuntu nor can i reset the stuff
[14:20] <Zeaal> can anyone tell me a solution for this?
[14:20] <tzanolo> Zeaal, can you boot in windows?
[14:20] <Zeaal> yes by default i boot in windows..
[14:20] <Zeaal> I dont get an opt to boot in ubuntu
[14:21] <tzanolo> ok, there are a lot of things that may be wrong
[14:21] <Zeaal> is there a way i could fix this? or well undo all the changes and start over again?
[14:22] <Zeaal> i need to recover that dedicated space and allocate it back to E:
[14:22] <tzanolo> for me, its difficult to understand the new way the boot at motherboard works, UEFI.
[14:22] <Zeaal> ...
[14:23] <tzanolo> Zeaal, you just want to recover the space and keep just windows?]
[14:23] <Zeaal> yes
[14:23] <Zeaal> i mean I'd start over again then .. this time carefully
[14:32] <Zeaal> hi sorry .. got disconnected
[14:33] <Zeaal> lemme explain my problem again..
[14:33] <tzanolo> ok.
[14:33] <Zeaal> I stupidly installed Ubuntu on Drive E: (I had windows alrdy on C:)
[14:33] <Zeaal> so I partitioned E 50 GB and installed Ubuntu 14 on that
[14:34] <Zeaal> now I cant find that partition anywhere in windows partition manager thingie nor do i get an opt to boot into ubuntu on start up
[14:34] <Zeaal> I need to know if there's a way to fix this?
[14:34] <tzanolo> soee, the easy way Zeaal to recover the space
[14:34] <tzanolo> is trough the windows itselv
[14:34] <tzanolo> itselv
[14:34] <tzanolo> itself
[14:34] <Zeaal> Or how to I revert everything
[14:34] <Zeaal> oh
[14:34] <Zeaal> Please tell me tzanolo
[14:34] <cfhowlett> Zeaal, windows will not see ubuntu partitions

[14:35] <Zeaal> I'm there tzanolo
[14:36] <cfhowlett> Zeaal, boot ubuntu USB, start gparted.  format the ubuntu partition as nfts and join that partition to your windows partition
[14:36] <tzanolo> my windows is in portuguese brasilian language, im googling to find the enghish version of the screen
[14:36] <tzanolo> Disk managment
[14:37] <Zeaal> That partition's a part of Data E cfhowlett.. probably should allocate it back and re-install ubuntu in C's partition
[14:37] <tzanolo> you must find disk managment, Zeaal, then you can resize, format
[14:37] <Zeaal> im there
[14:37] <Zeaal> wait i dont know what to do there lol
[14:37] <Zeaal> which one is ubuntu's?
[14:37] <tzanolo> at disk managment you can delete the partition and it will become FREE SPACE
[14:37] <cfhowlett> Zeaal, ubuntu is formatted as ext4
[14:38] <Zeaal> I have two partitions.. OEM partition and Primary Partition
[14:38] <Zeaal> they dont have any names
[14:38] <Zeaal> I think it's the primary one i gotta delete?
[14:38] <mcphail> tzanolo: I presume the problem is your locale uses a decimal comma rather than a decimal point, which is why you get a comma rather than a dot?
[14:38] <tzanolo> then you boot ubuntu 15 pendrive, choose TRY, and when you get in unity, there will be a icon on desktop INSTALL UBUNTU.
[14:38] <tzanolo> i made it yesterday with my computer, everithung is fine.

[14:40] <tzanolo> cfhowlett, Zeaal , in windows, you will not see the partition MOUNTED, but at DISK MANAGMENT, you will find the partition as UNKOWN
[14:40] <asdxzd> thanks a lot guys ... so sorrry ... :)))
[14:41] <Zeaal> ugh.. unstable connection
[14:42] <Zeaal> anyway tzanolo I gotta delete the primary partition right?
[14:42] <tzanolo> cfhowlett, Zeaal, you can delete the unknow partition and it will become free space again.
[14:43] <Zeaal> there are two unknown partitions
[14:43] <Zeaal> OEM and Primary
[14:43] <Zeaal> i have no idea what the OEM is but i think it was there before

[14:44] <Zeaal> see them?
[14:44] <Zeaal> and that 9.12 unallocated space..
[14:46] <Zeaal> ok so i deleted the Primary Partition
[14:46] <Zeaal> now how do I allocate the space of it to E: ?
[14:47] <Zeaal> D*
[14:47] <tzanolo> oem partition is a place that the computer manufactures keep the iso of windowns. when you recover from factory, the new fresh instalation is in this space.
[14:49] <Zeaal> i deleted the unknown partition.. now how do i allocate it to a drive?
[14:49] <Zeaal> Data D: in this case :|

[15:02] <RickyB98> windows xp
[15:02] <RickyB98> but i'm booting from bios
[15:03] <cfhowlett> lubuntu or xubuntu or that machine RickyB98
[15:03] <RickyB98> could you rephrase that please?
[15:03] <BluesKaj> RickyB98:  you need a bootable image on your usb stick, not a copy of your desktop
[15:03] <cfhowlett> RickyB98, old machine.  try lubuntu or xubuntu
[15:03] <RickyB98> of course BluesKaj
[15:03] <RickyB98> i used dd on mac to flash it
[15:04] <RickyB98> cfhowlett, right, but why isn't it working? what's missing on the machine that stops it form running?
[15:04] <BluesKaj> flash ?
[15:04] <RickyB98> i mean..
[15:04] <RickyB98> i made the usb bootable basically
[15:06] <SchrodingersScat> It can be worth reimaging the drive, sometimes it doesn't always take.
[15:06] <BluesKaj> RickyB98:  did you set the usb as first in the boot sequence in your bios?
[15:07] <RickyB98> it didn't appear in the boot sequence, but it did appear in the bootable drives when pressed F11 (that is, select boot drive or sth)
[15:13] <RickyB98> BluesKaj, are you still there?
[15:13] <BluesKaj> RickyB98:  windows xp hmm, seems it might be a hardware problem like graphics unable to boot the image
[15:14] <BluesKaj> you mifgt want to try a lighter version

So now been on nouveau drivers for two days. No crash like it. I was told to run a memtest before submitting this as a bug, but can't for the life of me run it. Can't I just assume it is indeed the Nvidia drivers that are at fault or could it still be
[15:44] <aotea> faulty ram?
[15:46] <lotuspsychje> aotea: ubuntu version?
[15:46] <aotea> lotuspsychje, 15.10
[15:46] <lotuspsychje> aotea: did you try LTS already?
[15:47] <aotea> lotuspsychje, I did not, seeing as Plasma 5 is not available for it. Or is it enough to run it on live usb?
[15:47] <sw0rdfish> oh
[15:47] <sw0rdfish> I see
[15:48] <lotuspsychje> aotea: as troubles on pc arise, its good to test multiple situations and versions, to make sure where the problem lays exactly
[15:49] <lotuspsychje> aotea: i would clean install to an LTS version and try if you getting crashes there also
[15:50] <lotuspsychje> aotea: i remember you tried all nvidia drivers and nouveau also right?
[15:50] <aotea> lotuspsychje, yes, 304 legacy and nouveau both run stable, while 340 and 352 crashes at random

[15:53] <aotea> lotuspsychje, yes, tried first with bumblebee, purged that and installed prime instead. also installing 352 seem to include nvidia-prime, but yes I've tried prime, and looked around the nvidia-settings.

[15:55] <lotuspsychje> amr: this would be the version reccomended
[15:56] <aotea> lotuspsychje, well, no I didn't try that. Guess there is nothing left but doing that and or the LTS...
[15:56] <amr> im not sure what youre saying... i should figure out how to install 1.3.0-2 outside of apt-get ?
[15:56] <amr> and then wine will use that..?

[15:57] <sw0rdfish> lotuspsychje yeah ok, can't find the old laptop RAM I had lying around somewhere... so i think i will go for lubuntu with the 1GB old laptop that I have :D
[15:57] <sw0rdfish> should i get 14.04 or ?
[15:57] <lotuspsychje> sw0rdfish: that will do smooth mate
[15:57] <sw0rdfish> 15.10?
[15:57] <lotuspsychje> sw0rdfish: LTS is very reccomended in most cases, but thats up to you
[15:58] <sw0rdfish> yep
[15:58] <mcphail> amr: if you are using software from the default repos, the dependencies should be handled automatically (if not, it is a bug and should be reported). If you are using software from PPAs or other sources, you are on your own, I'm afraid. Generally, :i386 and :amd64 versions can coexist happily
[15:58] <sw0rdfish> lotuspsychje I'll got 14.04 and then when I upgrade to the next LTS does it upgrade from 14.04 to 15.10 and then to the new LTS or?
[15:58] <amr> sorta kinda not what i asked. i have the libvpx1 from when i compiled a version manually or intel video drivers
[15:58] <amr> im aware i could remove that or overwrite it with the one from the repo
[15:58] <lotuspsychje> sw0rdfish: 15.10 is not lts

[16:00] <sw0rdfish> lotuspsychje nice
[16:00] <amr> thanks i sorta knew that. i was looking for some "oh yeah you totally might need 2 versions of <x> thing, heres how you do it:"
[16:00] <lotuspsychje> sw0rdfish: in some cases xubuntu performs very well on older laptops too, maybe try both?
[16:01] <mcphail> amr: If you can, make sure you set the prefix for self-compiled libs to "/usr/local". The package manager will not touch anything there. Of course, your compiled libs make break existing packages
[16:01] <lotuspsychje> amr: mixing package versions is mostly not a good idea
[16:01] <amr> ah, awesome
[16:01] <amr> thats def useful, thanks mcphail
[16:01] <amr> lotuspsychje: yea i knew that too :)
[16:01] <amr> needs must
[16:02] <sw0rdfish> I suppose this is the latest LTS version / the file that I'm looking for "lubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-i386.iso"
[16:02] <lotuspsychje> sw0rdfish: correct
[16:02] <sw0rdfish> lotuspsychje well which one is prettier xubuntu or lubuntu :D
[16:02] <lotuspsychje> sw0rdfish: if your old laptop is 32bit
[16:02] <sw0rdfish> yes its 32bit buddy :)
[16:02] <lotuspsychje> sw0rdfish: thats also a choosable flavor
[16:03] <lotuspsychje> sw0rdfish: they both have another feeling
[16:03] <mcphail> amr: if you need a special lib for an individual app, considet sticking the lib somewhere outside the usual path and call the particular app with "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/special/lib/directory ./appname"
[16:03] <sw0rdfish> lotuspsychje so, both have a different feeling ?
[16:03] <mcphail> amr: an alternative is the "LD_PRELOAD" variable which allows you to override specific libs
[16:03] <amr> youre a star
[16:04] <amr> literally exactly what i was hoping existed
[16:04] <amr> thanks

[16:41] <YamakasY> ikonia: can you be more precise ?
[16:42] <ikonia> it's on my 15.10 install, but I'm not on it, so I can't confirm the path for you
[16:42] <YamakasY> ok, this is an upgrade
[16:42] <YamakasY> I see it there tho /usr/lib/klibc/bin/reboot
[16:42] <YamakasY> which seem to work
[16:44] <GFXDude> ikonia, can the answer file be used in conjunction with the -y parameter? As in, the sudoer prompt is the only one that isn't answered properly via the -y. If I feed in a < answers.txt file, with a single line that reads "N" (no quotes), will it default to using the -y answer, and then if that doesn't work, look to the input file for the proper answer?
[16:44] <GFXDude> Or will I need to not use the -y parameter, and just provide an answer to all prompts in the answers.txt
[16:45] <ikonia> GFXDude: don't know, I'd have to check, I don't have an example to hand
[16:45] <GFXDude> Ok, I'll try it both ways.

[17:21] <seeeb> in dec 21 my ubuntu host upgraded several libs, all was fine guests were up. Today I've restarted the host and none of the guests were up
[17:22] <compdoc> can you start them manually?
[17:22] <seeeb> they are not even listed
[17:22] <seeeb> kvm-ok says :  INFO: /dev/kvm exists
[17:22] <compdoc> seeeb, you use virt-manager
[17:23] <seeeb> yeah virt-manager is there but empty
[17:24] <seeeb> the log  /var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log says at the end:  qemuCapsExtractVersion:1408 : internal error Cannot find suitable emulator for x86_64
[17:24] <compdoc> seeeb, you may have to reconnect virt-manager. Ive installed all the updates, but havent seen the problem. But Im on 14.04
[17:24] <seeeb> ah you are in 14 ...
[17:24] <seeeb> my host is not in 14
[17:25] <seeeb> maybe that hurts
[17:25] <seeeb> so I either try to downgrade qemu or upgrade the host
[17:29] <seeeb> the host is in ubuntu 12.04
[17:30] <seeeb> compdoc: by chance do you have any host that is with ubuntu 12.04running well with updated qemu?
