[04:37] <Alan502> it seems that i cannot ./configure when a directory is in an ntfs partition, is there a way i can ./configure without having to move my files to an etx3 partition?
[04:38] <IdleOne> JustD: glad you figured it out
[04:38] <rww> spO: the official requirements are 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended.
[04:38] <JustD> IdleOne, glad you told me to wait ^^
[04:38] <rww> ubottu: requirements | sp0

[04:38] <KaAttaKilla> sigh...
[04:38] <IdleOne> JustD: re-installing the OS is absolutely the last thing you should do after you have tried everything twice :)
[04:39] <arand> After having defined specific interface settings in /etc/network/interfaces, how do I disable that and reassociate NetworkManager to that interface _without_ having to reboot?
[04:39] <KaAttaKilla> anyone at all know the xrandr command to change refresh rate? xrander --size 1280x768 changes size but its the wrong refresh and i cant see anything
[04:39] <usser> arand, sudo service networking restart
[04:39] <Alan502> is there a way i can ./configure in ntfs partitions? it seems that i can only compile on etx3 partitions...
[04:39] <Dreamglider> Why does Ubuntu insist on having the cooling fan running even if the temperature is 30 deg celcius ?
[04:40] <greezmunkey> arand: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[04:40] <frogzoo> Alan502: you'll have all sorts of permissions issues
[04:40] <JustD> IdleOne, ok ok ,, more questions LOL ... i see everyone say ex3 ex3 .. mine is ex4 .. is that ok ?
[04:40] <lstarnes> JustD: yes
[04:40] <JustD> what's the diffrence anywa ?
[04:41] <lstarnes> JustD: ext4 is a new filesystem based on ext3 that is meant to replace it
[04:41] <HowDoI> KaAttaKilla, try adding the -r YourRefreshRate or --rate YourRefreshRate
[04:41] <IdleOne> JustD: 9.10 defaults to ext4 file system. yes it's ok
[04:41] <frogzoo> !ext4
[04:41] <JustD> ooh .. cool
[04:41] <JustD> what do that "!" means ?
[04:41] <frogzoo> it pipes command to the bot
[04:41] <IdleOne> !bot > JustD
[04:41] <jafer> how to hack wireless networks
[04:41] <ubottu> JustD, please see my private message
[04:41] <Alan502> yeah, frogzoo , i have figured out that ntfs brings me lots of problems of that type. But, can i ./configure in ntfs with some command or something?
[04:41] <lstarnes> JustD: in this channel, messages starting with a ! are read as commands or questions for ubottu
[04:41] <mab> jafer: very carefully
[04:41] <soyporti> <frogzoo> do you have any idea of what can i do to recover at least some ofthe files? gparted failed on me.
[04:41] <lstarnes> ubottu: ext4
[04:42] <IdleOne> JustD: !something triggers ubottu to send info on said trigger
[04:42] <melrockz> there is a problem with gstreamer; it doesnt recognise libmp3lame0 to convert files to mp3
[04:42] <frogzoo> soyporti: no idea, sorry
[04:42] <Richard_Simmons> What's the command to have xrandr change the resolution of a specific X session, such as if I want to change the resolution of a computer via SSH?
[04:42] <JustD> !ext4
[04:42] <soyporti> <frogzoo> thanks anyway
[04:42] <HowDoI> jafer, if you want to learn penetration testing on your own network, try installing and learning aircrack-ng
[04:42] <lstarnes> JustD: it's not working
[04:42] <JustD> oooh.. cool
[04:42] <lstarnes> JustD: the bot does not know about ext4
[04:43] <lasivian> hrrm, didn't work. Anyone know what driver a "02:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation WiFi Link 100 Series" would use
[04:43] <arghh2d2> Richard_Simmons: man xrandr?
[04:43] <frogzoo> Alan502: my guess is it will depend on the particular app, but if you're asking this question, debugging the issues is beyond your skills anyhow
[04:43] <JustD> yeah i figured ^^
[04:43] <jafer> thanks man
[04:43] <greezmunkey> !being_smart

[04:43] <JustD> THanks ^^
[04:44] <frogzoo> melrockz: many people swear by sound juicer
[04:44] <mab> lasivian: if you take the model number, and the serial number, and go to intel's download driver page, and do a search... I betcha something'll come up.
[04:44] <lstarnes> JustD: also, search google for "ext4 vs ext3"
[04:44] <arghh2d2> melrockz: many people swear by "command line"
[04:44] <JustD> lstarnes, will do ^^ ,, thanks
[04:44] <Alan502> frogzoo: ah ok, i've been thinking to rather format it to fat32; will that help?
[04:44] <arand> usser: greezmunkey: that does not work. although, it seems that restarting the NM application might... (Will be testing later)
[04:44] <lasivian> mab, I don;t know, it's inside a netbook
[04:44] <melrockz> sound juicer doesn't work 4 me...
[04:45] <jafer> is their any way to make recover forr ubuntu
[04:45] <frogzoo> Alan502: obviously not
[04:45] <melrockz> sound juicer just doesn't display the option to convert to mp3

[04:47] <soloact_> Looking for a walkthrough: Jaunty 64-bit, had Radeon 9800, temporarily had an old Creative nVidia card, now have Radeon HD 3850, Live CD will only boot to compatibility mode. In regular mode, or normal hdd boot, I get almost a black screen. Am currently in the recovery shell, as Video is unusable at the moment. Am thinking I may have to get rid of all Video drivers except mesa, but don't know how or what commands to type in.
[04:47] <melrockz> arghh2d2, i tried everything...
[04:47] <etfb> TheCash: what does Google say?
[04:47] <lasivian> mab, it seems odd that there isn't a way to see what drivers are currently loaded

[04:49] <TheCash> this computer is old btw
[04:49] <etfb> TheCash, then you need to find it.  Let me see if I can remember how you do that...

[04:49] <lyrae> bazhang, rww didnt find any of those

[04:49] <TheCash> ok
[04:49] <etfb> IdleOne, TheCash: beat me by mere seconds!
[04:49] <arghh2d2> melrockz: then i dont know what to say... you could try installing k3b which basically does everything you could possibly do to a cd/dvd as in rip/burn
[04:50] <melrockz> i can play, but cant encode mp3's
[04:50] <TheCash> lol
[04:50] <etfb> TheCash, in my case, this gives a result like "01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Mobility Radeon HD 3650

[04:52] <buntuskiffler> hi, anybody have ATI Video working with new ubuntu?

[04:53] <soloact_> buntuskiffler, I only got it to work with live cd in Compatibility Mode. I'm here looking for a solution, too.
[04:53] <buntuskiffler> yeah

[04:57] <spO> mike, whenver i used wifi, it was usually not for gaming or something
[04:57] <maco> KaAttaKilla: you havent actually said what you want to do with xrandr. how could anyone help?
[04:57] <Meshezabeel> firefox keeps showing it is using over 100% of CPU when running "top", how is this possible?
[04:57] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, you're not going to give up that easy are you? What's the problem?
[04:57] <KaAttaKilla> macro i have, several times over the last hour
[04:57] <BioVorE> Meshezabeel: multicore processor?
[04:57] <khelvan> KaAttaKilla, You don't "need" to use Ubuntu because no one, within one minute of you asking, helped you with a question about xrandr? :P
[04:57] <mikebuntu> Well I'm not gaming... just transferring my iTunes library. I temporarily moved it to another computer so I could restore and not worry about losing the files... 3hrs for 10GB
[04:57] <maco> KaAttaKilla: i just see "can someone help me with xrandr?" over and over...
[04:58] <KaAttaKilla> no i asked several times.. ive been here for quite a while
[04:58] <maco> KaAttaKilla: anyay, mind repeating for those who just walked in?
[04:58] <mikebuntu> sorry, 2 hrs for 10GB
[04:58] <IdleOne> KaAttaKilla: please restate your question
[04:58] <xim_> is there a command i can type to bring up a simple dialog box with a given string and an OK button?
[04:58] <imatech> anyone know the ftp site for os downloads?
[04:58] <KaAttaKilla> my question is, xrandr --size 1280x768 changes the size, but it messes up the refresh rate, how can i get it to 60?
[04:58] <mikebuntu> I calculate that to roughly 1.5 Mb/s... I'm on Apple Airport Extreme... just seems like that's slow. I get 1 Mb/s downloading from the internet.
[04:58] <imatech> !ftp site for ubuntu
[04:58] <ubottu> Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[04:59] <JustD> ok let's say i used "Locate" to search for a file .. then i see the path .. if i want to open it using terminal .. what do i do .. fastest way ?
[04:59] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, you need to be doing that business in your xorg.conf file

[04:59] <ubottu> Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)

[04:59] <greezmunkey>  maco, educate me.
[04:59] <maco> greezmunkey: the point of xrandr is to let you make such changes on the fly without xorg.conf

[04:59] <ubottu> Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors - PLEASE use the !torrents to download !Karmic, and help keeping the servers' load low!
[05:00] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey ah its u, i never got kde to fully boot, gnome WILL boot but the resolution is way off
[05:00] <JustD> ok let's say i used "Locate" to search for a file .. then i see the path .. if i want to open it using terminal .. what do i do .. fastest way ?
[05:00] <greezmunkey>  maco, I agree, but it's not perminant, like commiting it to xorg.conf :p
[05:00] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey actually got the system booted all the way up and online now
[05:00] <maco> greezmunkey: you can put xrandr commands in /etc/gdm/Init/Default to make them take effect at gdm and last throughout your session
[05:00] <IdleOne> JustD: gedit /path/to/file
[05:00] <mikebuntu> Oh well
[05:01] <JustD> i have to type the whole path, no other ways using terminal

[05:02] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, ok if your on a live CD then xrandr is about all you can do, but - once you find the settings that work for your gear, write it down for your actual instal!
[05:02] <JustD> IdleOne, loooool .. no no ... i mean like "find" and a command like "Open" or something

[05:06] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, maco is right, paste your xrandr output to start with.

[05:16] <JustD> IdleOne, ^^ sorry
[05:16] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: http://paste.ubuntu.com/334958/
[05:17] <khelvan> Sorry for the noobish question, but how do I tell which mount points are mounted to which partitions/devices in the terminal?
[05:17] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, did you see what maco said?
[05:17] <KaAttaKilla> maco: sorry i dont think i fully follow you... what is the name of mode?
[05:17] <khelvan> !geezer
[05:17] <SeaPhor> khelvan, type route
[05:18] <cn28h> khelvan, df -h
[05:18] <cn28h> ;p
[05:18] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: yea i didnt totally understand it
[05:18] <khelvan> cd28h - It doesn't tell me where /home is :)
[05:18] <lstarnes> khelvan: mount
[05:18] <cn28h> khelvan, or mount with no parameters
[05:18] <cn28h> khelvan, /home might not be its own partition
[05:18] <IdleOne> JustD: http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-linux-beta-ubuntu-32
[05:18] <SeaPhor> or,, khel type df -ah
[05:18] <cn28h> khelvan, or you mean how to tell which partition it's on?
[05:18] <lasivian> my wireless was working, but now it's showing disabled, suggestions on how to turn it on?
[05:18] <cn28h> khelvan, you could df /home
[05:18] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, honestly, I havn't set x resolution like this before, maco would you mide repeating you last two posts please :)
[05:19] <khelvan> cn28h - Ahh, you are correct. I'm checking this via SSH on my headless server. I am guessing /home isn't on its own partition.
[05:19] <maco> KaAttaKilla: the first bit after it says "Modeline" is the mode name
[05:19] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: not used to all this stuff, and my limited cmd knowledge is foreign in linux... what exactly should i input?
[05:19] <maco> KaAttaKilla: when you run cvt 1024 768
[05:19] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, watch for maco
[05:19] <JustD> IdleOne, reaaaaaly Thanks Man ... gotta go now .. see you later .. and have a nice day pro ;)
[05:19] <maco> KaAttaKilla: "cvt 1024 768" and itll say something like: Modeline "1024x768_60.00"   63.50  1024 1072 1176 1328  768 771 775 798 -hsync +vsync

[05:20] <maco> KaAttaKilla: so then youd run: xrandr --newmode  "1024x768_60.00"   63.50  1024 1072 1176 1328  768 771 775 798 -hsync +vsync

[05:21] <maco> KaAttaKilla: then you run: xrandr --output default --addmode "1024x768_60.00"  (again substitute in whatever name cvt gave it)
[05:21] <lasivian> I hATE TO GO SO FAR AS REBOOTING JUST TO RE-ENABLOE WIFI

[05:22] <lat> virtuald, what driver are you using?
[05:22] <maco> greezmunkey: so then all the xrandr commands (not the cvt one) go in /etc/gdm/Init/Default and ta-da! no need for xorg.conf
[05:22] <virtuald> lat: the latest radeon crack of the day
[05:22] <ctmjr> lasivian: try /etc/init.d/networking restart
[05:23] <Takagami> I did a minimal 9.04 install to a Dell Mini 9 with A03 firmware. I installed the xorg, gnome-core and alsa-base packages. I have tried adding the "options snd-hda-intel model=dell" switch to the end of the alsa-base file. Between all the things I have tried i have successfully seen the hardware, been able to select, use and change volumes of the hardware, but no sound will ever come out. Speakers or Headphones...
[05:23] <KaAttaKilla> macro: i got some errors.. hang on
[05:23] <virtuald> but i'm going back to the default driver
[05:23] <lasivian> ctmjr, thank
[05:23] <zoggnoff> Why would restart networking give me a connection but the interfaces file won't give me anything on boot up??
[05:23] <Takagami> I know I'm missing something simple
[05:23] <maco> Takagami: alsa-base/alsa-driver is for if you want to recompile the sound drivers yourself...
[05:23] <virtuald> since i'll upgrade to lucid soon and i don't want to mess it up
[05:23] <maco> Takagami: the kernel includes all your sound drivers to begin with
[05:23] <vinpan> i need help i lost my menu bar how do i get it back?
[05:23] <lat> virtuald, propitiatory from ATI?
[05:24] <maco> KaAttaKilla: ok. by the way, its maco, not macro, so im not getting highlighted
[05:24] <virtuald> no, from xorg
[05:24] <virtuald> lat: google xorg edgers ppa
[05:24] <greezmunkey> maco, that's pretty spiffy!, thanks for the education. I'll be giving that a try here in a minute!
[05:24] <B166erx> Why does all file transfers to External drive/USb are freezing in Karmic ?
[05:24] <lat> virtuald, ok, thanks!
[05:24] <maco> greezmunkey: its how i got my mom's computer to do 1280x1024 instead of 1024x768 last week
[05:25] <Takagami> maco: so if I can see the hardware, select to use it, change the volumes, but no sound comes out... what am I missing?
[05:25] <alokito> is it possible to share internet via bluetooth from windows xp to ubuntu?
[05:25] <maco> Takagami: possibly the driver is misdetecting your hardware
[05:25] <maco> Takagami: in which case, file a bug against the kernel
[05:25] <greezmunkey> maco, it's good to be nice to your mom!
[05:25] <Takagami> but it works if I do a full install as opposed to a minimal "do it yourselfer"
[05:26] <vinpan> hello i lost my menu bar how to i get it back?
[05:26] <maco> Takagami: ah i see...maybe ummm is your user not in the sound/audio (whatever its called) group but pulseaudio is also not in use?
[05:26] <gh0st> I have a bit of a security question if this is the appropriate place to ask it
[05:26] <Takagami> maco: no pulse audio. and user IS in group.
[05:26] <cn28h> may as well ask
[05:26] <lstarnes> gh0st: does it pertain to ubuntu?
[05:28] <gh0st> I'm the only one on my network who knows how to forward ports on the router... or even what that would mean. Somehow my computer got setup as a Teredo server in the list of forwarded ports, and I know I didn't do that. Should I be worried about my security of my machine?
[05:28] <greezmunkey> maco, so to begin with, run xrandr to see what modes are available, then use cvt to determine the exact modeline, which is then fed back to xrandr - sound about right?
[05:28] <gh0st> Sorry, I'm pretty n00by =/
[05:28] <maco> greezmunkey: if xrandr doesnt list the mode you want, cvt will generate a modeline for the one you want
[05:28] <greezmunkey> maco, that's the piece I was missing! thanks :)
[05:28] <maco> greezmunkey: then you need to --newmode to tell xrandr about it, then --output <blah> --addmode <blah> to associate that new mode with an output
[05:29] <KaAttaKilla> ok maco: http://paste.ubuntu.com/334962/
[05:29] <maco> greezmunkey: and finall --output <blah> --mode <blah> activates the mode
[05:29] <greezmunkey> maco, no doubt, I pasted all of that into my running "excellent" proceedures file that I keep open just for this type of thing ;)
[05:29] <maco> KaAttaKilla: ah ok, on the --addmode, *only* put the "1280x768_60.00" , not the rest of the bit after it
[05:30] <KaAttaKilla> ok trying again
[05:30] <ddoom_> i have a hard drive that was formatted using mac os x with gpt, anyone know how i can change this to mbr

[05:32] <nomnex> can someone help with network definitions and clear things up for me?
[05:32] <maco> KaAttaKilla: xrandr --output, not just --output
[05:32] <nomnex> what's samba in short
[05:32] <gh0st> Any thoughts on the question I've asked? Or where it would be appropriate to ask it?
[05:33] <Takagami> nomnexa windows compatable file sharing service
[05:33] <maco> KaAttaKilla: xrandr --output default --addmode "1280x768_60.00"
[05:33] <maco> KaAttaKilla: *then* xrandr --output default --mode "1280x768_60.00"
[05:33] <maco> KaAttaKilla: in that order
[05:33] <jetscreamer> ddoom_: what? 'change to mbf' ??
[05:33] <nomnex> Takagmi: do I need samba to configure a linux only workgroup behind a NAT?
[05:33] <jetscreamer> r
[05:33] <mathew> hello, I am not able to edit a file or change its permissions even as root
[05:33] <greezmunkey> maco, the only reason I'm even fooling with it is to access some voicemail hard drives...I figured I'd install X while I was at it. Now it's asking if I want opengl support...here's another half hour!
[05:34] <maco> gh0st: that sounds like a windows question since its teredo ##windows
[05:34] <jetscreamer> mathew: man chmod maybe
[05:34] <vinpan> i lost my panel how do i get it back please
[05:34] <Takagami> nomnex: you shouldn't NEED it you can use NFS, I fins samba a bit easier and I have windows machines so...
[05:34] <gh0st> Teredo is windows software?
[05:34] <mathew> jetscreamer:chmod: changing permissions of `/etc/resolv.conf': Operation not permitted
[05:34] <nomnex> Takagami: so it either samba either NFS?
[05:34] <maco> gh0st: teredo is a windows protocol for ipv4 over ipv6
[05:34] <maco> gh0st: miredo is the *nix implementation
[05:34] <ddoom_> jetscreamer: http://pastebin.com/m504ebbee
[05:35] <gh0st> I see, thank you.
[05:35] <gh0st> I guess I don't need to worry about my machine
[05:35] <Takagami> nomnex: there are a few other protocols you can use but those are the most, service based, rather then server based, if you get my meaning.
[05:35] <maco> gh0st: installed miredo and didnt recognize the name difference?
[05:35] <jetscreamer> ddoom_: you want to nuke it or what
[05:35] <ddoom_> jetscreamer: yep
[05:35] <jetscreamer> mathew: as root ?
[05:35] <mathew> yes
[05:36] <Johngo> hi
[05:36] <nomnex> Takagami: now what's the relation between SAMBA for network share and SSH?
[05:36] <cooper> hi
[05:36] <cooper> :D
[05:36] <gh0st> Probably my parents computer... My mom likes to click all the ads about free desktop wallpapers etc.
[05:36] <cooper> ever been here
[05:36] <Johngo> nope
[05:36] <KaAttaKilla> maco: ok im so lost and confused now
[05:36] <maco> KaAttaKilla: im sorry
[05:36] <jetscreamer> ddoom_: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/whateverthepathistothathd  ... ctrl c it after a min or two
[05:36] <jetscreamer> then fdisk it
[05:36] <KaAttaKilla> maco: i think i need to just reboot from livecd and try it all again from the start
[05:36] <gh0st> maco, No I just found a random port open on my router that I, or any other human in the house, did not open
[05:36] <maco> KaAttaKilla: no no youre ok
[05:37] <gh0st> It was forwarding to my machine, was wondering if I needed to be concerned
[05:37] <maco> KaAttaKilla: you havent messed it up. the commands you put in didnt work because 1) they were out of order and 2) one had a typo. thats all :)
[05:37] <KaAttaKilla> maco: i dont even know where im at now
[05:37] <jetscreamer> ddoom_: of=/dev/sdd apparently.. don't mess it up or you might nuke the wrong thing
[05:37] <KaAttaKilla> and the stuff i was copying is way too far up in chat now
[05:37] <ddoom_> jetscreamer: ok i'll try taht
[05:37] <maco> KaAttaKilla: pastebin the output of "xrandr" again and we'll see how it's changed so far, ok?
[05:37] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, I'll paste what maco typed, in order brb
[05:38] <Takagami> nomnex: SSH is a way to log into your linux machine and thow commands at it, samba is primarily a file sharing service
[05:38] <KaAttaKilla> maco: 334967
[05:38] <maco> KaAttaKilla: this should be all you need to do now: http://paste.ubuntu.com/334968/
[05:38] <greezmunkey> http://paste.ubuntu.com/334969/
[05:39] <gh0st> Thank you
[05:39] <nomnex> Takagami: does it make sens to use ssh to connect a remote and host in my workgroup?
[05:39] <Shazbot> I'm installing grub2 on my terabyte external, I'm going to do this command: "sudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/USBFolderName /dev/sdx" the partition I'm going to boot everything off of is called BOOT, and it's mountpoaint is /media/BOOT so would I do "sudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/BOOT /dev/sdg" ?
[05:39] <ctmjr> gh0st: the best way to secure your router is too make sure administration remote access (ports closed) is turned off or use a very secure password
[05:39] <vinpan> how do you install the panel bar at the bottom in the terminal?
[05:39] <nomnex> edit: host and client
[05:39] <Shazbot> vinpan, what's the panel that you want?
[05:40] <vinpan> where it has my menu bar
[05:40] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, be sure to substitute your display size though!
[05:40] <Shazbot> oh... so not a new program?
[05:40] <Shazbot> just the one that's already there?
[05:40] <vinpan> ya
[05:40] <Shazbot> I don't know how to do that in the terminal, but I can tell how you to do it with the GUI
[05:41] <Takagami> nomnex: Yes! I use SSH daily to preform minor tasks on my desktop from my netbook. It's pretty easy to secure and it is encrypted with keys by default. Also check out the NX protocol from http://www.nomachine.com if you want a really fast graphical way to log in.
[05:41] <vinpan> i dont know GUI
[05:41] <vinpan> i need the main menu bar at the bottom of the screen
[05:41] <nomnex> Takagami: what's the point to use a secure shell with wired pc behind a router on a lan?
[05:42] <Takagami> I'm not, my netbook is on 3G WWAN from verizon.
[05:42] <KaAttaKilla> maco: http://paste.ubuntu.com/334972/

[05:50] <nomnex> Takagami: sure, what product on your link do you recommand?
[05:50] <BlueX_> anyone know?
[05:50] <nomnex> Takagami: NX Free edition for Linux?
[05:51] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, from what I see you're almost there!
[05:51] <matt____> I cannot edit a file even as root, please help, http://pastebin.com/mdbacdcb
[05:51] <Takagami> nomnex: though free NX is fairly easy to setup it is a bit more advanced then a simple SSH setup... what kind of linux experience do you have?
[05:52] <maco> KaAttaKilla: hmm xrandr output looks correct. that error is annoying though
[05:52] <nomnex> none with ssh
[05:52] <KaAttaKilla> maco: tell me about it...
[05:52] <nomnex> Takagami: I will keep NX as step 2
[05:52] <Takagami> nomnex: well you need SSH setup in order to install NX so we could start there if you wanna check it out...
[05:52] <mahngiel> i'm a little unaware of scripting. i've found the code i'd like to use for a script; just not sure how to save/open/use it
[05:53] <nomnex> Takagami: so recap, I need samba to share my files and ssh to access my network from outside my lan - do I get it right?

[05:54] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, is this a laptop you are working on?
[05:54] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: it is
[05:55] <greezmunkey> maco, what about cvt -r option!!!
[05:55] <maco> greezmunkey: never tried it
[05:55] <greezmunkey> maco, it makes a differance on the "numbers" here, could be it??
[05:55] <Linux-CLI> I can't get S-Video to work on my Ubuntu 9.10 based Dell Inspiron 700m. Can someone please tell me how to get S-Video to work? (I'd be happy to switch to a different debian-based distribution to get this to work)
[05:55] <steven__> need to turn off my player on my hp or adjust the volume, cant do it no video is wrtten there, since i installed ubuntu i can hear the musik but cant turn it down.... what can i do
[05:55] <maco> greezmunkey: sure give it a try
=== Bridge| is now known as Bridge|A
[05:56] <Takagami> nomnex: that's the just of it. There is deffinitly MUCH more that comes along with those, but a basic setup of each is a good place to start.
[05:56] <KaAttaKilla> ok i typed cvt -r option... now what?
[05:57] <steven__> ok, no one can help
[05:57] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, generate a new modeline with cvt -r hres# vres#, I don't remember what yours were, so cvt -r 1024 768, but substitute your numbers!
[05:57] <nomnex> Takagami: I am processing: now, using ssh cli, can I see the GUI of the remote pc (e.g using Terminal server client)?
[05:58] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: oooook... um... this is going to end badly... any chance i could convince you to tell me exactly what to type?

[05:58] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, what was the size you needed again?
[05:58] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: or can i get u to login to this machine and help?
[05:58] <peepsalot> what app would you folks recommend for a remote dekstop connection between two linux boxes
[05:58] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: i need 1280x768_60.00
[05:58] <Linux-CLI> I can't get S-Video to work on my Ubuntu 9.10 based Dell Inspiron 700m. Can someone please tell me how to get S-Video to work? (I'd be happy to switch to a different debian-based distribution to get this to work)

[05:59] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, you probably want maco in there rather than me!
[05:59] <KaAttaKilla> either or... brother here, running quickly out of time to get this working
[05:59] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, ok so generate the new modeline: cvt -r 1280 768
[05:59] <Takagami> nomnex: A terminal server client (i.e. VNC, RDP) are good for easy access within a large LAN or monitoring, I would use NX for a small setup for quick secure access outside the LAN.
[05:59] <ctmjr> mahngiel: copy the script in a text editor and save it with an .sh extention then go into the dir where you saved it and type sh ./filename.sh
[05:59] <steven__> gonna start to cry, love ubuntu but if  i cant adjust my player on my hp or broadcast... then no go.... gonna have to reinstall xp...cry
[06:00] <Linux-CLI> How do I enable S-Video?
[06:00] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, paste it here please
[06:00] <Takagami> nomnex: but remember that they can all be used inside the lan as well.
[06:00] <Takagami> nomnex: going to move the car... brb.
[06:01] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: 334985
[06:01] <mahngiel> ctmjr: well, thanks for the reply :)
[06:01] <nomnex> Takagami: I see, that's maybe not what I want. How can I see the GUI of my remote pc (the server) I access through a CLI shell (ssh) from the client (e.g. notebook outside, access desktop home?)
[06:02] <steven__> ok nobody knows what to do, so back o windows... it was worth a try... nice system.... but little support and help
[06:03] <mahngiel> steven__: say what?
[06:03] <Bridge|A> what does this mean?
[06:03] <Bridge|A> [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down
[06:03] <Bridge|A> it then just says
[06:03] <Bridge|A> [notice] Apache/2.2.11 (Ubuntu) mod_ssl/2.2.11 OpenSSL/0.9.8g configured -- resuming normal operations
[06:03] <Bridge|A> and apache2 starts like nothing happends
[06:03] <FloodBot1> Bridge|A: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[06:03] <Bridge|A> but i cant connect via port 443(SSL)
[06:03] <Bridge|A> port 80/8080 work fine though
[06:04] <steven__> i cant get any help, so it looks like i am going to have to reinstall windows.... ubuntu looks great.. but what shall i do if i cant even get a control of my hp player
[06:04] <breinera> nomnex: "ssh -X username@system" makes it so you can start graphical commands, but in order to see the actual desktop of the remote computer you need something other than ssh
[06:05] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, run the rest of these: 334987/
[06:05] <mahngiel> ctmjr: so, say the script is called 'blah.sh', and in /home... i would enter in a terminal "sh blah.sh" ?
[06:05] <ziroday> steven__: you need articulate your issue clearly for us to help you, all the people here are volunteers
[06:05] <nomnex> breinera: thanks, what do I need (on the client side)?
[06:06] <foo> I'm stuck in CLI. I have a 160GB hard drive and I did badblocks -vvv on it. it reports there is no badblocks, but is this an accurate measuer to ensure that the drive is good?
[06:06] <ziroday> foo: you should do a fsck from a livecd
[06:06] <ctmjr> mahngiel: no enter sh ./blah.sh
[06:06] <robert__> i can't hear my audio in cheese and not detected in skype. i have an msi wind u100 can anyone help?
[06:06] <nomnex> brej era
[06:06] <nomnex> brej
[06:07] <mahngiel> ctmjr: parton my noobage... but enter "sh . /blah.sh" in a terminal?
[06:07] <ziroday> !fsck | foo
[06:07] <ubottu> foo: fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot
[06:07] <Linux-CLI> xorg
[06:07] <breinera> nomnex: I used freenx to do remote desktop viewing in the past however most of my time anymore is command line
[06:07] <steven__> yes i know... i am not complaining... i am just saying if i am to stupid to know what to do, or how... how shall i use the system
[06:07] <Takagami> nomnex: You can use NX or VNC or RDP for what you want
[06:07] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, did that work?
[06:07] <nomnex> breinera Takagami: I see clearer, thanks
[06:08] <Whitie> ok
[06:08] <mahngiel> ctmjr: can i just click it and "run"
[06:08] <Whitie> this is kind of a weird question
[06:08] <steven__> all i need is a plugin that enables me to see and use the player on a hp
[06:08] <Whitie> but i just installed xchat
[06:08] <nomnex> Takagami: a good tutorial to set up the server (well, the desktop?)
[06:08] <ziroday> steven__: and as I have stated, you need to state your issue clearly and articulate as to what you are trying to do, what you are doing and what you expect to happens
[06:08] <Whitie> and how do i get this server to stop connecting on open
[06:08] <Takagami> nomnex: NX will log you into an account, NOT allow you to view what is already up. VNC will allow you to control and view what is on the current logged in account on the machine.
[06:08] <ziroday> steven__: what do you mean by a "player"?
[06:08] <Takagami> nomnex: sorry, should have mentioned that... ;-)
[06:09] <foo> ziroday: hm, I see
[06:09] <nomnex> Takagami: what about the default Terminal server client?
[06:09] <foo> ziroday: I am going to reinstall the filesystem, hm
[06:09] <ziroday> foo: err reinstalling the filesystem will mean you will have to reinstall your machine
[06:09] <shea> hey
[06:09] <steven__> on my homepage i had windows media player embedded, now that i have changed to ubuntu i can hear it but cant control it
[06:09] <ctmjr> mahngiel: you can make a launcher for it on your desktop
=== shawn__ is now known as Tiders
[06:10] <shea> does anyone know any linux clients that support RDPv7?
[06:10] <arvinoids> hi all, i have a question. this is regarding rhythmbox. how do i get it to encode in a specific bitrate when transferring to mp3 player?
[06:10] <steven__> i need to see it.. i get the message no video
[06:10] <Takagami> So using ubuntu under "System > Preferences > Remote Desktop" That control panel is for a VNC server setup that is already present in a full install.
[06:10] <Linux-CLI> My xorg.conf is as follows: http://pastebin.com/m289ddf4d - What do I need to add to enable S-Video?
[06:10] <ziroday> shea: I believe the default client shipped with Ubuntu does, but not completely sure
[06:10] <Takagami> nomnex: So using ubuntu under "System > Preferences > Remote Desktop" That control panel is for a VNC server setup that is already present in a full install.
[06:10] <mahngiel> ctmjr: aight, i think i got it fingered out. thanks
[06:10] <wgrant> ziroday, shea: I believe it only does up to RDPv5
[06:11] <mahngiel> ctmjr: i wanted to get it clear, because it's a post-install script for minimalization
[06:11] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: the first line of that dindt work
[06:11] <KaAttaKilla> got an error
[06:11] <foo> ziroday: yeah, I know. Basically, my current drive died. I found another drive, but I'm not 100% sure it's good. badblocks reports no badblocks, but is there any other tests I can do?
[06:12] <ziroday> foo: yes, you need to fsck the drive like the factoid above explained
[06:12] <chai_> there a specific server for ps3?
[06:12] <luomo> My network manager tries to connect to my DSL modem through wifi but then message comes:"wireless connection is disconnected". Please help
[06:12] <arvinoids> hi all, i have a question. this is regarding rhythmbox. how do i get it to encode in a specific bitrate when transferring to mp3 player?
[06:12] <foo> ziroday: the drive I found has a ntfs windows partition that I'm going to delete. Should I delete it, make it ext3, and then fsck that?
[06:12] <nomnex> Takagami: just a correction, I was mentioning Remote Desktop Viewer in applications. Does it serve the same purpose as Remote desktop in system
[06:12] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: 334992
[06:12] <steven__> so stated that anybody could understand... but still no answer
[06:12] <foo> ziroday: I'm certain the current drive is bad, if that's what you're trying to ask me to do
[06:13] <robert__> i can't hear my audio in cheese and not detected in skype. i have an msi wind u100 can anyone help?
[06:13] <foo> ziroday: (40+ badblocks, system doesn't boot, it's read-only)
[06:13] <ziroday> foo: I'm sorry I'm a bit lost, you want to take a new drive and stick your Ubuntu install on to that?
[06:13] <ziroday> foo: or you want to do a fresh install on this new drive?
[06:13] <Takagami> nomnex: Remote Desktop Viewer in Applications > Internet is what you use to view your Remote Desktop in System. ;-)
[06:13] <foo> ziroday: sorry :) my fault. I have a current drive, it's dead. I have a drive I found, but I'm not sure if it's good. badblocks says 0 badblocks on it, but I was wondering if there are any other tests I can run
[06:14] <foo> ziroday: fresh install, but I want to make sure it's a good drive first. is there any other tests I can do other than badblocks?
[06:14] <ctmjr> Linux-CLI: what video card do you have?
[06:14] <foo> ziroday: or if badblocks reports 0 badblocks, is that good enough and should i run with that?
[06:14] <ziroday> foo: what filesystem is on the drive?
[06:14] <luomo> My network manager tries to connect to my DSL modem through wifi but then message comes:"wireless connection is disconnected". Please help
[06:14] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKill, yikes, unfortunately I don't have a test machine to run through this right now. Apparantly xrandr doesn't like the "R"
[06:14] <chai_> is there a certain server for ps3 ubuntu?
[06:14] <foo> ziroday: right now, on this drive I found that I want to use, fat32... but i'm going to delete that
[06:14] <breinera> steven__: it is not ubuntu that is having problems but your browser is missing plugins that will handle windows media player
[06:15] <ctmjr> mahngiel: did you get it working the way you want?
[06:15] <KaAttaKilla> can someone just connect to my machine to help out?
[06:15] <chai_> #ps3ubuntu
[06:15] <KaAttaKilla> im really low on time now
[06:15] <chai_> oops
[06:15] <nomnex> Takagami: I don't get your last answer, sorry. What difference between REmote Desktop viewer (in applications) and remote desktop in system preferences/ both are clients aren't they?
[06:15] <ziroday> foo: hmm okay, your BIOS might have a SMART checking system that could be informative
[06:15] <greezmunkey> ] 69/KaAttaKi
[06:15] <greezmunkey> ] 69/KaAttaKi
[06:15] <steven__> yes i know but which plugin and where do i get it... google gives me no answer
[06:15] <foo> ziroday: I have access to the smartctl command. /me looks at man page
[06:15] <greezmunkey> oops
[06:15] <edbian> nomnex: The one in preferences is a GUI for the settings of the server
=== SpY is now known as Guest328
[06:16] <Quan-Time> ive noticed that i CANT use the backspace key on my kb as "back" shortcut.. is that just a firefox setting, or something i need to edit / addon ?
[06:16] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: 0.0
[06:16] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, bad paste o__O
[06:16] <wgrant> Quan-Time: That's a Firefox setting that is switched on by default in Windows, but not other operating systems.
[06:16] <Takagami> nomnex: the one in system > preferences is the control panel to setup the Remote Desktop to access. The Remote Desktop Viewer in Applications > Internet is what you would use on another machine elsewhere to VIEW the remote desktop that you setup.
[06:16] <arand> Having booted with interface-specifics in /etc/network/interfaces N-M shows my interface as "Not managed", how would I go about, without rebooting, to transfer management over to NM again? (wlan0 interface).
[06:16] <Quan-Time> so its specific to win ? gay...
[06:16] <nomnex> edbian, I get it now, thanks. on the server desktop, do I need to install VNC? or is it already installed (I am talking about the server, not the client)
[06:16] <breinera> steven__: I have mplayer and I have not had any problems with audio/video on the web
[06:17] <Quan-Time> cheers wgrant
[06:17] <wgrant> Quan-Time: You can switch it on in other operating systems.
[06:17] <greezmunkey> KaAttaKilla, is there any way that you can take this up later, I have to leave here for a while :(
[06:17] <luomo> My network manager tries to connect to my DSL modem through wifi but then message comes:"wireless connection is disconnected". I have installed ubuntu 9.10 on my machine. Please help
[06:17] <foo> ziroday: ziroday smartctl -i /dev/sdb says smart support is enabled. any tips on a way to have smartctl tell me if the drive is good or not:
[06:17] <foo> ?
[06:17] <edbian> nomnex: The server is not installed I don't think.  I don't remember.  Try and install it and see what happens
[06:17] <nomnex> Takagami: cristal clear
[06:17] <Quan-Time> wgrant: how would i switch it on ? ideas ?
[06:17] <Takagami> nomnex: Thumbs up!
[06:17] <nomnex> edbian: sudo apt-get install vnc-server?
[06:17] <arvinoids> hi all, i have a question. this is regarding rhythmbox. how do i get it to encode in a specific bitrate when transferring to mp3 player?
[06:18] <edbian> nomnex: Yeah probably.  "sudo aptitude search <packageName>" might be helpful.  (or synaptic)
[06:18] <nomnex> Takagami: I owe it to you, thanks
[06:18] <steven__> it works perfectly under windows but not here and i want to try my luck with ubuntu, i can hear the musiok but cant control it... missing plugin
[06:18] <KaAttaKilla> greezmunkey: sadly, thats it, brother is taking the laptop w/ him... was the last chance to get it working
[06:18] <Takagami> nomnex: You shouldn't have to install ANYTHING if you have a full default install of Ubuntu 9.04 or better
[06:18] <KaAttaKilla> thanks anyways
[06:18] <edbian> nomnex: "aptitude show <packageName>"
[06:18] <O__o> greezmunkey, ?
[06:18] <breinera> steven__: try installing mozilla-mplayer it is in the normal repositories
[06:18] <nomnex> Takagami: I do, edbian, I try. I check and come back later. Thanks for the support
[06:18] <Takagami> nomnex: yeah. no problem... now to my problem
[06:19] <steven__> just see no video
[06:19] <edbian> nomnex: Thanks for using linux! :D
[06:19] <a-stray-cat> if I install windows 7 over 9.10, is there an easy way to reinstall grub2 like there was for grub1?
[06:19] <luomo> My network manager tries to connect to my DSL modem through wifi but then message comes:"wireless connection is disconnected". I have installed ubuntu 9.10 on my machine. Please help
[06:19] <edbian> a-stray-cat: If you install windows 7 over linux it will automatically but the windows boot loader in the MBR and it's boot loader will only boot 1 os (windows)
[06:20] <a-stray-cat> i know
[06:20] <edbian> a-stray-cat: automatically put* the...
[06:20] <Takagami> I did a minimal 9.04 install to a Dell Mini 9 with A03 firmware. I installed the xorg, gnome-core and alsa-base packages. I have tried adding the "options snd-hda-intel model=dell" switch to the end of the alsa-base file (as suggested by some). Between all the things I have tried i have successfully seen the hardware, been able to select, use and change volumes of the hardware, but no sound will ever come out. Speakers or Headphones..
[06:20] <a-stray-cat> but with older version (9.04) you could just pop in the cd and run a couple of commands
[06:20] <edbian> a-stray-cat: I'm not sure how to install grub2 again, sorry! :(
[06:20] <a-stray-cat> and you'd get grub back
[06:20] <wgrant> !grub2 | a-stray-cat
[06:20] <ubottu> a-stray-cat: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager in Karmic. For more information and troubleshooting on GRUB2 please refer to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2
[06:21] <Quan-Time> a-stray-cat: ive been wrestling with that all day yesterday. i had to install win7 first, THEN ubuntu.. wouldnt work any other way
[06:21] <steven__> all possible plugins are aktieviert
[06:22] <a-stray-cat> :<
[06:22] <a-stray-cat> maybe i should just downgrade to grub1
[06:22] <edbian> a-stray-cat: grub1 can't boot ext4, that's the whole reason ubuntu uses grub2
[06:23] <chai_> what do i need to get hulu to work? firefox cant find the right plugins
[06:23] <steven__> including mplayer plugin 3.5
[06:23] <edbian> a-stray-cat: What might be a good idea is to just follow the instructions for grub1 and see if it works! lol
[06:23] <optimizer> no 3d acceleratrion necessary; i just want a tablet that runs ubuntu; what's a good choice?
[06:23] <a-stray-cat> nah i tried that before
[06:23] <a-stray-cat> and grub1 can boot ext4 right?
[06:23] <a-stray-cat> i used ext4 in 9.04 i thought
[06:24] <edbian> a-stray-cat: grub1 can NOT boot ext4
[06:24] <edbian> a-stray-cat: ubuntu 9.04 uses ext4 by default but you can change it at install time
[06:24] <wgrant> a-stray-cat: Did you follow the instructions on the page that ubottu pointed you to?
[06:24] <wgrant> edbian: GRUB1 is patched to boot ext4.
[06:24] <wgrant> edbian: Ubuntu 9.04 uses ext3 by default, but Ubuntu 9.10 uses ext4.
[06:25] <edbian> wgrant: Really?  I thought the whole point of grub2 was ext4 support?
[06:25] <a-stray-cat> i specifically changed my 9.04 to use ext4 :/
[06:25] <edbian> wgrant: Oo!  You are right about ubuntu default choice though
[06:25] <wgrant> edbian: GRUB2 has upstream ext4 support, but it wasn't the main reason.
[06:25] <edbian> wgrant: IC, thank you.
[06:25] <Circs> I am having a highly abnormal problem with gparted, when I launch it dosfsck gets stuck in a loop and loads my processor to 50% and will not release even if gparted is force closed. If i kill dosfsck while it is in this loop and leave gparted open, gparted functions normally.
[06:25] <edbian> a-stray-cat: Sorry about the bad info!
[06:26] <Circs> Can someone tell me what's happening?
[06:26] <steven__> breinera.. what can i do....mplayer plugin ist aktierviert
[06:27] <Takagami> That sounds crazy Circs!
[06:27] <a-stray-cat> hmmm there is a recover grub 2 via live cd section on that page that wgrant linked though, ill give those a try after installing windows ;|
[06:27] <chai_> how do i make my mouse cursor bigger? im on a 1080i tv
[06:27] <Linux-CLI> Okay, I've rebooted
[06:27] <Linux-CLI> Can I get the info to change again?
[06:28] <zeltak> hya. anyone knows how to stop ubuntu one from asking for a password after every reboot by any chance?
[06:28] <wgrant> zeltak: Try asking #ubuntuone. That sounds like a bug.
[06:28] <Linux-CLI> xorg.conf or something?
[06:29] <Linux-CLI> Wasn't able to start the X server :(

[06:39] <colon> i updated it too
[06:39] <colon> i can mount the ntfs partition too
[06:39] <edbian> colon: You have to add an entry for it at the end of the file.  Does it still have all those helpful examples?

[06:50] <edbian> luomo: What's the issue?
[06:51] <wademurray> sexcopter: do you turn it on and off every day?
[06:51] <wgrant> sexcopter: anacron should be installed by default. I'd use that.

[06:51] <sexcopter> wademurray: it *tends* to be slept every night
[06:52] <wademurray> sexcopter: why i ask is because you could set up the @reboot timer and it'll backup when you turn it on

[07:22] <wgrant> acrobat: Only the DVD images will have the full toolchain.
[07:23] <DaZ> wgrant: he doesn't want it from a cd imo ;f
[07:23] <DexterLB> well yes but if you installed, add stuff, as acrobat wants a toolchain
[07:23] <wgrant> acrobat: Do you not have network access?
[07:23] <acrobat> wgrant: that was what i was thinking too
[07:23] <DaZ> acrobat: create your own iso
[07:23] <oldtopman> run ubuntu 9.10 on a ibm 755cx
[07:23] <Takagami> oh man... I need some FPS action...
[07:23] <acrobat> how
[07:23] <DexterLB> he'll need at least 1.5gb
[07:23] <acrobat> ffs
[07:23] <DaZ> hm
[07:23] <wgrant> acrobat: Why do you want to have the toolchain on the ISO? Can't you just download it afterwards?
[07:23] <DexterLB> correct me if I'm wrong
[07:23] <eddy> can someone help me with my error message
[07:24] <eddy> Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: nvidia-71-kernel-source (>= 71.86.08)
[07:24] <ShazbotMcNasty> I need assistance - I did fsck and I got an error, can anyone decifer the error and tell me what to do? http://pastebin.com/m53795adc
[07:24] <ShazbotMcNasty> eddy, do sudo apt-get update and try again
[07:24] <oem> hi all
[07:24] <DexterLB> eddy: nvidia-71 that's a pretty old driver
[07:24] <oem> er
=== oem is now known as steev-efikamx
[07:24] <oldtopman> shazbotmcnasty lemme checck
[07:24] <DexterLB> eddy: try reloading the package info
[07:24] <yang_> Hey , can someone help me with a roll your own kernal issue? i got it to compile created deb but post init script realate  to nvida-common
[07:25] <Viking667> .... right. That's got the cooling sort of sorted out. took another 4 degrees C off the core temp
[07:25] <DexterLB> can someone help me? once again, my problem is: nautilus is showing ~ on the desktop instead of ~/Desktop
[07:25] <eddy> its not really na app....its a driver...may include an app with it
[07:25] <DaZ> DexterLB: do you have ~/desktop folder?
[07:26] <oldtopman> shazbotmcnasty yourpastebin is expired
[07:26] <DexterLB> DaZ: yes I do
[07:26] <steev-efikamx> so i have a machine that had ubuntu-minimal installed on it - openssh-server is installed, however it isn't started at boot - i've tried update-rc.d ssh enable - and it says its created the files but, for whatever reason, every time i boot the machine, sshd is not running and i have to blindly (no monitor that i can plug in to it) - and start ssh - am i missing something?
[07:26] <mado> oldtopman, pardon me? ... such a thing can expire?
[07:26] <ShazbotMcNasty> oldtopman, http://pastebin.com/m50c3321b
[07:27] <mado> is mine then still "alive"? oldtopman
[07:27] <oldtopman> mado pastebin is temporary
[07:27] <oldtopman> sazbotmcnasty i typed it in wrong
[07:27] <ShazbotMcNasty> the older one is still up....but the second one is a new one
[07:27] <ShazbotMcNasty> it's okay.
[07:27] <DexterLB> here's the contents of my home folder: http://pastebin.com/d46cb2d78
[07:28] <mado> i see ... well i'm sort of an apprentice :) ... i didn't know that before but ... yeah ... it makes sense
[07:28] <rolo> how do I run apache after I have installed it
[07:28] <oldtopman> shazbotmcnasty, looks like nothing really important
[07:28] <mado> oldtopman, i do hope though that i will find a solution to my problem ... but you should help ShazbotMcNasty first ... i guess she/he was here before me
[07:28] <DexterLB> rolo: it's already running
[07:29] <eddy> i wonder if ui shut down & connect of motherboard video would it find my driver
[07:29] <oldtopman> shazbotmcnasty, looks like nothing really important
[07:29] <rolo> and tomcat?
[07:29] <oldtopman> oops

[07:29] <DaZ> timtom: it does :f
[07:29] <oldtopman> mado whats your problem
[07:29] <DexterLB> timtom: why? it's great.
[07:29]  * Takagami loves his linux
[07:29]  * DexterLB too
[07:29] <mado> as i wrote a bit earlier ... -> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/335022/
[07:30] <Takagami> Stupid audio
[07:30] <eddy> timtom....go back to windows & virises
[07:30] <DaZ> DexterLB: and desktop always displays correctly :F
[07:30] <mado> once in a while i get this message when i try to boot ubuntu
[07:30] <mado> oldtopman,
=== hacker-palso is now known as hero
[07:30] <rolo>  Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
[07:30] <rolo> how do I change this?
[07:30] <oldtopman> mado what were you doing
[07:31] <DexterLB> DaZ: yeah, but in my case the problem is in me I spose
[07:31] <DaZ> DexterLB: why?
[07:31] <DexterLB> DaZ: you see, I ran the nonautilus script
[07:31] <mado> pardon me oldtopman ?
[07:31] <mado> what do you mean?
[07:31] <DaZ> DexterLB: it's somewhere in gconf but i don't have gnome right now
[07:31] <ShazbotMcNasty> oldtopman, wel I can't boot any iso's that are on my external hard drive
[07:31] <DexterLB> DaZ: then I ran it in reverse mode
[07:31] <mado> i was just booting ubuntu 9.10 oldtopman
[07:31] <DaZ> DexterLB: what script? :f
[07:31] <ShazbotMcNasty> the error is gives me is do "chkdsk /r" on windows
[07:32] <ShazbotMcNasty> so I do fdsk in linux, and that's the error that I'm having
[07:32] <DexterLB> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DefaultFileManager
[07:32] <oldtopman> hmmmmm
[07:32] <ShazbotMcNasty> so I can't boot any of my iso's that I have installed with grub2
[07:32] <Viking667> does grub2 even support booting off ISO?
[07:32] <Viking667> (let alone CD-ROM)?
[07:33] <mado> as you probably can see oldtopman i tried to boot it again ... and this time ... no error at all :) ... this drives me a bit crazy ... because every once in a while i get this message ... and i don't want to simpy ignore it oldtopman
[07:33] <oldtopman> mado, I know a bit of linux butmostly dsl an puppy sorry
[07:33] <mado> dsl?
[07:33] <mado> this small thing?
[07:33] <mado> oldtopman,
[07:33] <enzotib> damn small linux
[07:34] <DaZ> DexterLB: you can always reinstall nautilus imo
[07:34] <oldtopman> isnt damn banned
[07:34] <mado> brill! ... i could need some hand there too in the future (as far as i know)
[07:34] <DexterLB> DaZ: how?
[07:34] <Viking667> oldtopman: DSL is probably one of the few places you can use it
[07:34] <mado> oldtopman, looks like it's not ... although it's a curse word it's also a "technical jargon" :)
[07:34] <Viking667> Meanwhile, is there any way of getting those panels of mine to change monitors?
[07:34] <DexterLB> DaZ: aptitude reinstall won't help for gconf I guess
[07:34] <oldtopman> ok ha
[07:34] <DaZ> DexterLB: it won't but this script does something in /usr
[07:35] <steev-efikamx> Viking667: you can't drag them?
[07:35] <Viking667> uh, no?
[07:35] <oldtopman> do you suppose icouldrun ubuntu aff of a very old laptop
[07:35] <DexterLB> DaZ: I'll try moving nautilus gconf thing to a backup location and doing an aptitude reinstall
[07:35] <DaZ> it's almost morning here so i can't know what exactly, but it does something :F
[07:35] <eddy> hod do i install a .run file
[07:36] <eddy> *how
[07:36] <DexterLB> run it! :D
[07:36] <ctmjr> eddy: what run  file?
[07:36] <eddy> i mean whats the terminal commnad to run it
[07:36] <Linux-CLI> hi
[07:36] <DexterLB> in terminal: chmod +x yourfile.run && yourfile.run
[07:36] <Linux-CLI> Please recommend a way I can S-Video to work on my computer. I'm happy to use any Operating System except Windows to do this. As long as I am able to get that Operating System to play WMV. I am using a Dell Inspiron 700m. Which Operating System supports S-Video for my hardware?
[07:36] <Viking667> eddy: make it executable first. chmod
[07:36] <eddy> a driver for my video card
[07:36] <oldtopman> hi linux-cli
[07:36] <Viking667> ah. I see DexterLB just told you how
[07:36] <bazhang> Linux-CLI, which version of ubuntu are you running
[07:36] <MindVirus> How do I find out what process number is using the most amount of bandwidth?
[07:37] <MindVirus> That is, Internet bandwidth.
[07:37] <svinoba> eddy: ./<file>.run
[07:37] <thedarkthoughts_> hello
[07:37] <DexterLB> eddy: installing the driver from the nvidia f***g site is not recommended
[07:37] <Takagami> So I installed 9.04.3 ubuntu-minimal on my Dell Mini 9 A03. I have installed only the xorg, gnome-core and alsa-base meta packages. My sound hardware is detected correctly, I can change all volume levels and play audio. I don't get any sound from speakers or headphones... what am I missing?
[07:37] <Linux-CLI> bazhang: 9.10
[07:37] <thedarkthoughts_> Is that channel for ubuntu???
[07:37] <Linux-CLI> But am happy to upgrade or downgrade
[07:37] <wgrant> Takagami: There is no such release. Do you mean 8.04.3?
[07:37] <DexterLB> eddy: in the next kernel upgrade it'll fail and you won't be able to go into GUI
[07:37] <bazhang> thedarkthoughts_, yes
[07:37] <Viking667> steev-efikamx: and no, I can't drag them. This is the standard panels ya get with Gnome, on Ubuntu 9.10
[07:37] <thedarkthoughts_> ah..great
[07:38] <Takagami> sorry... no... latest 9.04
[07:38] <greezmunkey> MindVirus, get bmon, it's a start.
[07:38] <DexterLB> X restart, brb
[07:38] <Takagami> I played with 8.04.3 minimal last week for same issue
[07:38] <MindVirus> greezmunkey: I'll check it out.
[07:38] <mado> oldtopman, thanks for your hand
[07:38] <svinoba> Takagami: is headphone unmuted? in alsamixer?

[07:38] <thedarkthoughts> anyone knows how to install Snort on ubuntu 9.04
[07:39] <Takagami> svinoba: all mixers are unmuted and up to 98 or so...
[07:39] <DaZ> If set to true, then Nautilus will use the user's home folder as the desktop. If it is false, then it will use ~/Desktop as the desktop.
[07:39] <bazhang> thedarkthoughts, sudo apt-get install snort
[07:39] <DaZ> damn, he left :F
[07:39] <thedarkthoughts> ok thx, bazhand
[07:39] <thedarkthoughts> *bazhang sorry
[07:39] <oldtopman> eddy not sure chmod 755 <file>
[07:39] <eddy> dexter ...then how do i get my driver?
[07:40] <ctmjr> eddy: there are steps you need to take too install the drivers from nvidia's website it is not for the faint of heart

[07:41] <thedarkthoughts> ok, DaZ thx
[07:41] <thevishy> now I opened synaptic to install xchat , but i dont see the software ...
[07:41] <oldtopman> thevishy xchat seems to work well, usin it from puppylinux
[07:42] <MindVirus> Does anyone know how to view which processes are using the most Internet bandwidth?
[07:42] <soreau> thedarkthoughts: You can check the wiki http://wiki.compiz.org/ You will need an intel, ati or nvidia chipset made in this century
[07:42] <svinoba> thevishy: sudo apt-get install xchat or sudo apt-get install irssi
[07:42] <DaZ> soreau: lame, kwin-composite works on ViRGE :F
[07:43] <svinoba> thevishy: btw, its in Ubuntu Software Center under Internet
[07:43] <thevishy> right
[07:43] <soreau> DaZ: He asked about compiz, not kompiz
[07:43] <greezmunkey> MindVirus, check out ntop...
[07:43]  * Viking667 blinks. Still nothing relevant, even in gconf... funnily enough, there's a "disable_move" key, but no related schema.

[08:02] <fahadsadah> mado: Oh!
[08:02] <fahadsadah> Your disk is too slow
[08:03] <DexterLB> svinoba: it's unchecked for me too
[08:03] <mado> so ... shortly after i got this message ...
[08:03] <DexterLB> Trialpups: I'm doing it now.
[08:03] <a931bw> Dudes i need help !!! i installed openSUSE on SDA5 ubuntu was SDA1 bots OS have same swap but ubuntu wont load heres grub menu.lst http://pastebin.com/d49e5e5c2
[08:03] <mado> i switched off the computer (let it crash) and then i booted again ... this time ... no errors fahadsadah
[08:03] <fahadsadah> http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/810#Boot%20failures%20on%20systems%20with%20Intel%20D945%20motherboards
[08:03] <fahadsadah> mado: It's a boot time error
[08:04] <a931bw> Dudes i need help !!! i installed openSUSE on SDA5 ubuntu was SDA1 bots OS have same swap but ubuntu wont load heres grub menu.lst http://pastebin.com/d49e5e5c2
[08:04] <bazhang> !repeat | a931bw
[08:04] <ubottu> a931bw: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org while you wait.
[08:04] <mado> oh! ... i see fahadsadah (not really but now it  makes more sense) ... so ... what should i do about it? ... fahadsadah ... ... there is no "menu.lst" in ubuntu 9.10
[08:05] <a931bw> Dudes i need help !!! i installed openSUSE on SDA5 ubuntu was SDA1 bots OS have same swap but ubuntu wont load heres grub menu.lst http://pastebin.com/d49e5e5c2
[08:05] <svinoba> DexterLB: take a look at .config/user-dirs.dirs as suggested by Trailpups
[08:05] <a931bw> Help pleasee
[08:05] <fahadsadah> mado: Oh, forgot that.
[08:05] <a931bw> i hate that rpm based OS :(
[08:05] <bazhang> a931bw, dont repeat. see the message from ubottu
[08:05] <DexterLB> Trailpups, svinoba: that worked, thanks
[08:05] <fahadsadah> mado: /boot/grub/grub.cfg
[08:06] <Trailpups> DexterLB, great!
[08:06] <DexterLB> :)
[08:06] <Linux-CLI> I'm looking for a CLI tool which can batch search & replace through a list of files (as text-files, but different extensions). Any recommendations?
[08:06] <svinoba> DexterLB: Thanks to Trailpups, learnt a new thing today... :)
[08:06] <mado> er fahadsadah ... ok -> let's see
[08:06] <DexterLB> vim saves the day :D
[08:06] <fahadsadah> Linux-CLI: sed
[08:07] <mado> ok fahadsadah ... i opened it
[08:07] <mado> what now?
[08:07] <svinoba> GUI cant beat CLI right.. :D
[08:07] <ctmjr> Linux-CLI: well lets start from the beginning did you install any drivers for the card yet?
[08:07] <a931bw> Dudes i need help !!! i installed openSUSE on SDA5 ubuntu was SDA1 bots OS have same swap but ubuntu wont load heres grub menu.lst http://pastebin.com/d49e5e5c2
[08:07] <DexterLB> svinoba: yup
[08:07] <fahadsadah> mado: Find the line beginning with "linux"
[08:07] <DexterLB> svinoba: especially vim, it's gorgeous
[08:08] <DexterLB> gvim, kvim etc suck
[08:08] <monestri> home		/home/safire	vboxsf	uid=1000,gid=1000	0 1
[08:08] <monestri> home doesn't seem to be being mounted at boot
[08:08] <Linux-CLI> I'm looking for a CLI tool which can complete a directory listing (with full path, not sure if ls can do this) then add File <tab> to the start of each line. Any recommendations?
[08:08] <monestri> but mount home works
[08:09] <Linux-CLI> ctmjr: Nope
[08:09] <mado> fahadsadah, -> i guess you're talking about this -> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/335047/
[08:09] <ctmjr> Linux-CLI: your using gnome?
[08:09] <Linux-CLI> yep
[08:09] <fahadsadah> mado: Yes.
[08:09] <svinoba> a931bw: you have 'grub' on 9.10, not 'grub2'?
[08:10] <Linux-CLI> Probably because of an upgrade?
[08:10] <fahadsadah> mado: Please add "rootdelay=90" to the end of the line beginning "linux"
[08:10] <Archilles> If you know GRUB you have to relearn with GRUB2
[08:11] <mado> fahadsadah, how come this error occurs in 9.10 again?
[08:11] <zcat[1]> !grub2
[08:11] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager in Karmic. For more information and troubleshooting on GRUB2 please refer to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2
[08:11] <a931bw> idk im total noob on these
[08:11] <fahadsadah> mado: I'm not too sure, to be honest.
[08:11] <ctmjr> Linux-CLI: look in the main menu under system > administrator > hardware drivers and see if any thing is there
[08:12] <mado> fahadsadah, -> like this http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/335050/
[08:12] <fahadsadah> Yes.
[08:12] <Razahn> I hate to be a bother, but I just recently installed Windows 7 and Ubuntu 9.10. I am able to boot to both operating systems flawlessly, but in the GRUB menu it shows Ubuntu twice. Is there a way to remove the two un-needed listings of Ubuntu?
[08:12] <fahadsadah> Save, and reboot, and you won't see the problem again :)
[08:13] <mado> really? fahadsadah
[08:13] <Linux-CLI> ctmjr: Nup, nothing found
[08:13] <mado> ok ... but what if i want to boot another kernel? fahadsadah
[08:13] <mado> then i have to add this "rootdelay=90" again ... haven't i?
[08:13] <fahadsadah> Yes.
[08:14] <mado> ok ... i will note that ... just a sec
[08:14] <fahadsadah> Razahn: Please install the package "startupmanager" in the Ubuntu Software Center, then go to System->Administration->Startup Manager
[08:14] <mado> er fahadsadah ? ... do i also have to add "rootdelay=90" to the "recovery mode" ?
[08:14] <zenlunatic_> Linux-CLI, sed awk
[08:15] <Razahn> Thank you very much.
[08:15] <fahadsadah> mado: Not really
[08:15] <fahadsadah> Because recovery mode is basically that shell prompt you saw there
[08:15] <Linux-CLI> But awk is a whole programming language!
[08:16] <mado> uhuu -> so what does "rootdelay=90" help? fahadsadah ... ... i'm trying to learn more
[08:16] <fahadsadah> mado: It waits a fixed amount of time for your drive
[08:16] <fahadsadah> I think it's 2 seconds
[08:16] <fahadsadah> You have a slow drive
[08:16] <mado> a slow one?
[08:16] <fahadsadah> So it will wait up to 90 seconds
[08:17] <fahadsadah> Actually, a slow drive controller
[08:17] <mado> are you talking about the "rpm" ?
[08:17] <mado> and er ... can i do something about the slow thing?
[08:17] <mado> can i make it faster?
