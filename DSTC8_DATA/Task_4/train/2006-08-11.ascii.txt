[06:46] <yossman> what's your definition of 'LAN'
[06:46] <yossman> what are you trying to do
[06:46] <Tonren> Pyromaniak: NOOOOOOOOO!! Continuum doesn't work with Wine?!!
=== Tonren sobs!
[06:46] <azureal> lol...i just went through a _lot_ of debfoster prompts
[06:46] <cafuego> Tonren: Correct, until you loaded the driver again.
[06:46] <{K}Lubby> hook the two computers together, so that i can share the dsl internet connection on my xp with my ubuntu computer
[06:46] <Tonren> cafuego: Wouldn't it be a hassle to manually load and unload the driver every time I need to use the CD?  I mean, sure, I could write a script, but it just seems so... duct tape
[06:46] <I-W-A-N> HAI
[06:46] <{K}Lubby> basically, so that they can both be hooked into the internet
[06:47] <Tonren> cafuego: Oop.  What do you think of this solution?  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=942785  Seems like it might work.  I'll TIAS.
[06:47] <azureal> now it's removing enough packages to clear up 513mb.. idk if this irc chat program will eve work whene i'm done =P
[06:47] <cafuego> Tonren: It is exactly that.
[06:47] <yossman> lubby, you don't have a router?
[06:47] <{K}Lubby> and i got it to work with them both on xp, but i want one to have ubuntu
[06:47] <{K}Lubby> and yeah yossman i do, but thats for my home network that has dsl
[06:47] <Pyromaniak> Tonren: I was playing it yesturday, and now I can't get it to work
[06:47] <{K}Lubby> and im trying to set up a seperate one
[06:47] <Tonren> Pyromaniak: Weird. It stopped working in Wine?  Did you upgrade anything?
[06:47] <azureal> *gulps nervously*
[06:47] <yossman> lubby if you have the DSL working already in windows you can tell windows to share the connect
[06:48] <{K}Lubby> how?
[06:48] <Pyromaniak> Tonren: yeah... can you accept /msg? I'll paste the story
[06:48] <|thunder> lspci lists the name of my pcmcia linksys wireless card, does that indicate that there isa working driver? the card is not listed in sys/admin/networking
[06:48] <I-W-A-N> HAI

[06:51] <shawn_grimes> el_isma: I'm sorry, but I'm a native Windows user and no good with terminal commands :(
[06:51] <{K}Lubby> yossman, when i hit the okay button after putting in the static ip settings it says: could not enable the interface eth0. check that the settings are correct for this network and that the computer is correctly connected to it

[06:53] <GoDawgs> cafuego: I was soooo excited... because this is my only obstacle to using Ubuntu full time.
[06:53] <{K}Lubby> a possible problem i was thinking of is that im running ubuntu off the cd (the demo version type thingy) and haven't actually installed it yet

[07:12] <{K}Lubby> you mean do sudo ifconfig?
[07:12] <sethk> {K}Lubby, eth0 is locked up for some reason
=== bimberi [n=bimberi@ubuntu/member/pdpc.active.bimberi]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:12] <sethk> {K}Lubby, no sudo is necessary because you are just printing the configuration, not changing it
[07:13] <Tonren> {K}Lubby: use pastebin to paste the results and link us from here
[07:13] <{K}Lubby> uhhh theres a bunch of lines, give me a few to type them
[07:13] <Tonren> !pastebin
[07:13] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[07:13] <Tonren> {K}Lubby: just copy & paste them into pastebin and give us the link to the page.  :)
[07:13] <sethk> {K}Lubby, do this:   ifconfig > some-file-name
[07:13] <{K}Lubby> tonren, i can't do that if the ubuntu can't connect to the internet...
[07:13] <Tonren> {K}Lubby: oh snap
[07:13] <|thunder> Tonren, I am trying to install this card on a laptop for some ive crossed over to linux. she knows nothing. so I want it to be  easy. are you sure Network-Manager works with ndiswrapper ? i mean, once ndiswrapper is up and running does it function just like a native driver? As in, super easy config when swithcing APs and encryption.
[07:13] <sethk> {K}Lubby, sure you can.  use a usb stick or whatever
[07:13] <Tixer> kk, so I go to login, and I get the message after typing my password...
[07:14] <{K}Lubby> oh yeah duh seth
[07:14] <sethk> {K}Lubby, you must have something.
[07:14] <Tonren> |thunder: I'm fairly certain it does.  I had ndiswrapper running a while ago, and it worked fine with the network manager GUI.
[07:14] <sethk> {K}Lubby, if you reboot you will clear whatever has eth0 locked
[07:14] <Tixer> could not start kstartupconfig. Check your install.

[07:15] <sethk> {K}Lubby, for some things, yes.  but ifconfig should still work
[07:15] <Tonren> |thunder: You're welcome.  Remember, you'll need to run the "modprobe" command once you've installed ndiswrapper, then the driver, and you'll need to run "ndiswrapper -l" in terminal to make sure it's been installed properly.
[07:15] <{K}Lubby> so it *might* make a difference?
[07:15] <Tonren> mikeg: sup?
[07:15] <sethk> {K}Lubby, yes, it's possible
[07:15] <Tonren> {K}Lubby: it might.
[07:15] <mikeg> Tonren:  id like to ask, what to do  if my ubuntu 6.06 does not detect my SATA drive
[07:16] <sethk> {K}Lubby, I'm not saying it is likely, but it is possible
[07:16] <{K}Lubby> cause it seems like since its off a cd it would, cause you obviously can't save stuff like gateway info onto a cd once it's already burned
[07:16] <Tonren> {K}Lubby: Yea, you won't be able to edit system files like that.  But you should still be able to change network configurations
[07:16] <Tonren> mikeg: Hmmmm...
[07:16] <{K}Lubby> think i'll try doing that.... can i format/clean install ubuntu from hitting the little install button on the desktop?
[07:16] <sethk> mikeg, do lspci to find out what SATA chipset you have, then you may need to do an insmod for the kernel module for that chipset
[07:16] <mikeg> Tonren: its unknown

[07:49] <sethk> toxicfume, trying to modify partitions in place is risky and doesn't always work.
[07:49] <cafuego> odat: Like I said, I need no filesharing apps.
[07:49] <odat> pushpop, for montor setting what did you use  the simple selection?
[07:49] <sethk> toxicfume, of course, you can back up the partition, create a new, larger one, and restore to it.
[07:49] <aeread> "mv: cannot overwrite directory '/home/bung/.confg'" etc...
[07:49] <lxe> sudo mv?
[07:49] <pushpop> odat: it autodetected the correct model monitor
=== rellim [n=max@ip70-179-171-74.dl.dl.cox.net]  has left #ubuntu []
[07:50] <toxicfume> The problem I'm having with my ubuntu partition is that I already have some unallocated space on my darive, but for some reason i cannot increase the capacity of the Ubuntu partition using that unallocated space, i dont understand why. The partitioning program simply doesn't give me that option.
[07:50] <aeread> lxe, i happen to be root
[07:50] <sethk> aeread, you can't use mv to clobber a read only file even if you happen to be root
[07:50] <odat> pushpop, yea but when it asked for a resolution setting like 15, 17 or 19 inch monitor
[07:50] <sethk> aeread, you can use cp, then delete the original one
[07:50] <lxe> oh my bad
[07:50] <lxe> chmod it?
[07:50] <pushpop> odat: dont recall ill try again
[07:50] <sethk> aeread, or, you can rm the file before trying the mv  (remove the file by the same name in the target directory)
[07:50] <toxicfume> sethk: but then i would have to configure GRUB and everything again no?
[07:50] <{K}Lubby> heh nice, ubuntu basically has two passwords since it doesnt show your username like windows does
[07:50] <aeread> sethk: there are alot, i dont want to remove
[07:50] <aeread> but ill try to cp
[07:51] <sethk> toxicfume, no, as long as the designation of the /boot directory hasn't changed
[07:51] <el_isma2> Anybody knows how to make energy saving play nice? When I'm watching a movie I'd hope the monitor would stay on! I have to go to the control panel and disable it. (Running KDE... maybe this is not the place?)
[07:51] <aeread> thanks cp works
[07:51] <sethk> aeread, cp -f will work.  Of course, I'm assuming you know that it is safe to clobber all these things.  :)
[07:51] <cafuego> {K}Lubby: Not by default anyway.
[07:51] <azureal> {K}Lubby, you could make windows not show usernames either....
[07:51] <cafuego> {K}Lubby: You *can* make it list users accounts on the login screen.
[07:51] <Tonren> {K}Lubby: you can configure ubuntu to display usernames
[07:51] <{K}Lubby> oh well doesnt matter
[07:51] <{K}Lubby> i like it this way lol
[07:51] <toxicfume> sethk: designation of /boot? what does that mean?

[07:52] <Tonren> Pyromaniak: I though that was current
[07:52] <pushpop> odat: Fatal IO error  104
[07:52] <sethk> toxicfume, if your /boot is currently in /dev/hda1, for example, and you back up, create a new partition that is /dev/hda1, and restore to it, nothing in grub will need to be changed

[07:52] <Tonren> eugman: wrong channel

[07:53] <pushpop> odat: I run  dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and it brings up the screens where I can choose settings?
[07:53] <sethk> toxicfume, on the other hand, if you moved stuff around so that /boot was on /dev/hda1, and is now on /dev/hda2 (for example), that would require changes to the grub config

But the only problem I'm having with my ubuntu partition is that I already have some unallocated space on my darive, but for some reason i cannot increase the capacity of the Ubuntu partition using that unallocated space, i dont understand why. The partitioning program simply doesn't give me that option.
[07:53] <toxicfume> sethk: ohh okay
[07:53] <eugman> Tonren, worth a shot. Gimp channel is dead and I'm running gimp off of ubuntu.
[07:53] <odat> pushpop, do you have multiple video connections?
[07:53] <Tonren> eugman: fair enough; someone had to say it. ;P
[07:53] <KrisW> I just did an apt-get dist-upgrade and it seems like I'm still in breezy, how do I tell if the upgrade worked?

[07:54] <KrisW> yeah I rebooted
[07:54] <odat> pushpop, sounds like you have the monitor plugged in the wrong port
[07:54] <lxe> {K}Lubby: sorry, enter key was in the way. Wht's your issue again?
[07:54] <KrisW> that's why I'm confused
[07:54] <{K}Lubby> hey tonren or sethk, wanna try helping me again now that i have ubuntu installed and it's still got the same problem?
[07:54] <toxicfume> sethk: no this program i am using usually can..but i dont know why, for this partition it does not give me the option (nor the reason)
[07:54] <xelados> sethk: Any luck finding that .xinitrc?
[07:54] <KrisW> I thought something would happen heh
[07:54] <pushpop> odat: Its in the VGA port?
[07:54] <Tonren> {K}Lubby: what was the prob?
[07:54] <lxe> yes
[07:54] <el_isma2> KrisW: if you reboot, it should show you the new kernel (Ie: a linuxOLD entry or something like that)
[07:55] <sethk> toxicfume, I don't know, either, unless there is something about the layout of the existing partitions
[07:55] <pushpop> odat: I know how to plug a monitor in =)
[07:55] <el_isma2> KrisW: I meant, it should show you the new kernel and the old one
[07:55] <{K}Lubby> Tonren: remember, it wouldn't let me modify my static ip settings so i could connect my ubuntu to my xp
[07:55] <lumgwada> toxicfume: are you using qtparted?
[07:55] <mikeg> sethk: hi sethk i have made the commands already the lspci | grep-i "sata" and it return IDE Technologies, In.c VT8251 AHCI/SATA 4-port controller
[07:55] <sethk> toxicfume, I don't know what program you are using.  None of the linux partitioning programs allow resizing partitions.

[07:55] <KrisW> el_isma, I didn't see anyting like that

[07:56] <mikeg> sethk: what will i do next , after i have determined the controller

[07:56] <toxicfume> sethk: I'm using a program in windows xp actually (i'm aware of the fact that i might have to update grub after the partitioning in windows is finished)
[07:56] <el_isma2> KrisW: that's weird... I think that when you upgrade the old kernel still shows up
[07:56] <{K}Lubby> yeah lxe, that's the only thing i've tried (or know to try... im a complete ubuntu noob)
[07:56] <mikeg> sethk: how to know if this chipset r supported?
[07:56] <sethk> mikeg, we need to find the name of the kernel module that supports that chipset (if it exists)
[07:56] <el_isma2> lxe: where's network-admin?
[07:56] <KrisW> el_isma, there's a good possibility that I just don't know what I'm looking for
[07:56] <pushpop> odat: the blue VGA cable is plugged into the blue VGA port on the video card.
[07:56] <lxe> {K}Lubby : and what happened after?
[07:57] <mikeg> sethk:  how to find the kernel module then?
[07:57] <sethk> mikeg, I would start by looking in the Documentation subdirectory of the kernel source tree.  a google search is also sometimes helpful.
[07:57] <KrisW> well, I tried apt-get dist-upgrade again and it picked up where it left off
[07:57] <lxe> el_isma2: just type in network-admin
[07:57] <KrisW> so maybe it didn't finish last time

[07:57] <ricperry-ubuntu-> does anyone know of a way to install XAMPP (LAMPP) after installing Ubuntu Desktop 6.06?
[07:57] <KrisW> so maybe the time-out caused it to not upgrade?
[07:57] <odat> pushpop, the reason i am saying this is because if you have a add in video card then your probably have two different ports you monitor could go into too
[07:57] <{K}Lubby> lxe: i click the ethernet connection, hit properties, choose static ip, put in the settings i need for it to connect to my windows xp computer using crossover ethernet cable, hit okay, then hit the activate button *ping* then the error comes up
[07:58] <pushpop> odat: the X800 is PCI Express, is PCI:1:0:0 the right identifier for PCI express?
[07:58] <el_isma2> KrisW maybe

[07:58] <sethk> mikeg, the number 8251 doesn't occur in the kernel doc directory, which is discouraging.  it might be there with a different name or number, though.

[08:01] <ricperry-ubuntu-> el_isma2, I've seen the stuff about LAMP, but I'm looking for an easier way.  I figured since XAMPP comes in the server distro it should be pretty easy, but on the server disk, I can't find a .deb that installs it.  For that matter, I can't even find XAMPP on the server disk.  It's just an option at install time.
[08:01] <lxe> {K}Lubby: and try every option, even using dhcp on network-admin
[08:01] <toxicfume> sethk: okay lets say i copy my entire / from my current partition to a new/bigger partition..how do I make it so that the new partition will also be /dev/hda4 (which it is right now)?
[08:01] <el_isma2> CVirus then do: apt-get update, or just go to synaptic or whatever you use and refresh
