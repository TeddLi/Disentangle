<s> <user> : could be your video is encoded badly . </s>

<s> <user> : ? i tried with ls but it only show until min , not second since i wanted to list all files </s>
<s> <user> : stat ?? </s>
<s> <user> : hm , i do n't remember exactly how grub works though . it of course uses the bootsector , but where does it load the rest of the info from ? that i do not remember . </s>
<s> <user> : ls <unka-> -la </s>
<s> <user> : it has enough knowledge of filesystems to traverse the root and find later stages in DIR/boot/ DIR/grub/ in the particular partition it was installed from . </s>
<s> <user> : you should also try 'man ls' to figure out the other options to ls </s>
<s> <user> : ok trying to read </s>
<s> <user> <user> : so in other words , grub can have been hosed by e2fsck running on the linux partition only , since the grub files was located on the linux partition . </s>
<s> ah yes i see </s>
<s> <user> : in that case , your windows stuff might still be entirely safe . </s>
<s> hm ok , but then why does it say smart failure predicted every time i turn on now </s>
<s> <user> : you just need to create yourself a new boot sector , and not fiddle with the windows partition itself . </s>
<s> that does n't sound like everything 's safe </s>

<s> </s>
<s> <user> , how about gparted </s>

<s> well yes i was going to do it straight away , but e2fsck was like 80% done so i waited for it to end :/ </s>
