[11:01] <_2> Sturmeh grub
[11:01] <_2> Sturmeh or lilo
[11:01] <Sturmeh> grub i suppose can boot off a logical partiton
[11:01] <ePax> Sturmeh: Before you do any changes to your X, save one working copy. In case something goes wrong. cp xorg.conf xorg.conf-copy
[11:01] <Sturmeh> not me ePax tell ijusten
[11:01] <T-Man> wheres the best place to get the ubuntu hardy image so I can burn a cd?
[11:01] <_2> Sturmeh lilo can even boot without a partition
[11:02] <ePax> Sturmeh: Sorry then :D
[11:02] <_2> Sturmeh that's how mine is setup.
[11:02] <ijusten> when I try to run nvidia-settings, it says that I can't do that before I ad "nvidia-xconfig" to x configuration file..
[11:02] <Sturmeh> lol, _2 that's news to me, i once tried installing ubuntu on a logical partiton and no luck
[11:02] <ePax> T-Man: www.ubuntu.org
[11:02] <Sturmeh> why even bother making primary partitions then _2?
[11:02] <_2> Sturmeh well live and learn   :)
[11:02] <ePax> !nvidia | ijusten
[11:02] <ubottu> ijusten: For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:02] <Sturmeh> _2 and the answer to the other question?
[11:03] <leetsweden> ...
[11:03] <legend2440> T-Man: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
[11:03] <_2> Sturmeh "<Sturmeh> why even bother making primary partitions then _2?" <<< that one ?   no reason i can think of.
[11:03] <T-Man> ty legend2440
[11:03] <Dvyjones> I get the follorwing boot error: "wlan0: error fetching interface information: Device not found", also the wlan0 doesn't exist, but the network card is detected. How do I assign wlan0 to the network card on 8.04?
[11:03] <Dr_willis> _2,  its how the hard drive 'standard' grew over the years... at one time there was only primary partitions. :)
[11:04] <Dr_willis> _2,  or so my reading of 'history of computers 101'  seems to imply
[11:04] <adam7> _2: Sturmeh: Windows will only install on primary partitions, if that is of any concern
[11:04] <_2> Sturmeh windows would cry about it if you ran it and tried to look at the disk without any primary.
[11:04] <KrimZon> is setting up apache/mysql/php in hardy ontopic here?
[11:04] <_2> adam7 yeah that ^
[11:04] <ijusten> I have a backup, epax, but before I installed xserv
[11:04] <Dr_willis> _2,  why not ask.. WHY only 4 primaries... why extended/logical.. :)
[11:04] <ijusten> And I kind of need xserv
[11:04] <adam7> KrimZon: sure
[11:04] <ijusten> so to make everything work I need to know how to add the line
[11:04] <Sturmeh> _2 Logical partitions are containted within a Primary partition anyway, i guess it's only logical :P
[11:05] <_2> Dr_willis exactly.  and i have made up to 8 primaries   but only my bootloader liked it.
[11:05] <ijusten> It gives the instructions but it assumes I know the commands, which I dont
[11:05] <T-Man> I wonder where my nearest mirror would be
[11:05] <ePax> ijusten please look at this webpage. It explains how to install nvidia and ati drivers
[11:05] <Dr_willis> _2,  oh? ive never seen an app that would let me make more then 4
[11:05] <ePax> !nvidia | ijusten
[11:05] <ubottu> ijusten: For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:05] <_2> Sturmeh extended actually  but yes.
[11:05] <Sturmeh> u can't boot off logical partitions with all bootloaders, that's all i know
[11:05] <KrimZon> ive followed a guide i've found on setting up apache/mysql/php but at the moment i can't get php files to actually execute, firefox just tries to download them, and they get the source rather than output
[11:05] <_2> Dr_willis bootitNG does.
[11:05] <Sturmeh> bootitNG is scary
[11:05] <Sturmeh> :O
[11:06]  * T-Man needs to take linux classes
[11:06] <legend2440> T-Man: where are you?
[11:06] <T-Man> ware, ma
[11:06] <_2> Sturmeh heh   yeah.   i like it.
[11:06] <Sturmeh> _2 you use it?
[11:06] <ijusten> ubottu, I have done that, and it worked dandy for two months before I put in another screen, decided that I wanted separate desktops and not just to expand the previous one and installed xserv
[11:06] <ubottu> ijusten: Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[11:06] <ijusten> well, epax then
[11:06] <T-Man> ubottu is intelligent :)
[11:06] <ubottu> T-Man: Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[11:06] <ePax> KrimZon: try to ask in #apache
[11:07] <Sturmeh> ubottu, i think i have a crush on you
[11:07] <ubottu> Sturmeh: Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[11:07] <Sturmeh> SOMG
[11:07] <Sturmeh> lol
[11:07] <legend2440> T-Man: maine? mayb portland state univeristy?
[11:07] <_2> Sturmeh only if i mess a disk up now days.  but years ago i used it to boot several ms installs    in my prelinux days.   10 years ago
[11:07] <mudd`Hossam> anyone know how to set up postfix/ldap on ubuntu?
[11:07] <ePax> ijusten: have you tryed this guide? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:07] <Sturmeh> mayvbe if it was free _2
[11:07] <T-Man> maybe, will try
[11:07] <ijusten> epax, still nothing about xserv
[11:08] <_2> Sturmeh the copy i got was free,  it started off free.
[11:08] <cOzAtS> ePax:  i need step by step insructions please spear me 5 mins
[11:08] <_2> Sturmeh about 2 years later it went comerical
[11:08] <Sturmeh> cOzAtS do u know where windows is cOzAtS?
[11:08] <Sturmeh> yeah gay _2
[11:08] <Sturmeh> ( sorry )
[11:08] <cOzAtS> Sturmeh: yes
[11:08] <xintron> Is it possible to make a "shortcut" that runs a specific command in the terminal and also, removes the menu from the terminal?
[11:09] <funkyhat> KrimZon: which guide did you follow?
[11:09] <legend2440> T-Man: sometimes your better off using torrent files
[11:09] <T-Man> legend2440, I think there is a way to run a ping test on the list of servers
[11:09] <Sturmeh> um xintron not sure, why would you want to remove the menu?
[11:09] <adam7> xintron: if you use gnome-terminal and profiles, you should be good (profiles let you change the look of the gnome-terminal)
[11:09] <KrimZon> funkyhat: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
[11:09] <_2> xintron yes.    but if you want the menu permanently removed there is an option in the gnome-terminal to do that too
[11:09] <Sturmeh> ah adam7'
[11:09] <T-Man> I found it
[11:10] <InMyLife> hi sorry
[11:10] <cOzAtS> <unconvertable> ive messed app device.map and menu.lst i think and i dont understand the ouput of fdisk -l
[11:10] <Sturmeh> cOzAtS put it on ubuntu paste
[11:10] <leetsweden> ...
[11:10] <Sturmeh> http://paste.ubuntu.com/
[11:10] <adam7> xintron: gnome-terminal --window-with-profile=PROFILENAME               Open a new window containing a tab with the given profile. More than one of these options can be provided.
[11:11] <Sturmeh> tell us the link when ur done cOzAtS
[11:11] <InMyLife> sturmeh, you asked me to do the sudo apt-get update command
[11:11] <leetsweden> .
[11:12] <ePax> c0zats: Get your windows xp cd. restart your computer and boot from the cd. When you get option to install system KLICK UNDER IT to repair system. You have to get your cmd window from CD to be able to run 2 commands. When you DO get your CMD with your XP CD type fixboot c: and fixmbr ... You can search on google for more deailded howtos thay are planty of them.
[11:12] <InMyLife> to check whether the updates have been correctly installed.
[11:12] <Sturmeh> not me but what happened?
[11:12] <ePax> cOzAtS: Does your ubuntu starts?
[11:12] <InMyLife> oh it must've been ePax then
[11:12] <Sturmeh> ePax it does, he can't boot windows
[11:12] <Sturmeh> i got him to print the output of "fdisk -l" to print.ubuntu.com
[11:12] <Sturmeh> eh paste.*
[11:13] <_2>    someone should make a pastebin script for the ubuntu pastebin   so people could just pipe output to the pastebin      run blah | pastebin.sh        ya know ?
[11:13] <InMyLife> I got a bunch of lines starting with "Hit" and "Ign", such as Hit http://archive.ubuntu.com hardy-proposed Release.gpg
[11:13] <cOzAtS> Sturmeh:   http://paste.ubuntu.com/14286/
[11:13] <Sturmeh> windows xp or vista?
[11:13] <cOzAtS> sda is the win-ubuntu partition
[11:13] <cOzAtS> xp pro
[11:13] <Slart> _2: there is one
[11:13] <ePax> InMyLife: As i have told you. Since ubuntu asked for restart after updates your system can not have corrupted updates because they where allready installed.
[11:13] <bullgard4> adam7: I am back. "detlef@MD97600:~$ uname -r; 2.6.24-16-generic" But my framebuffer console has disappeared.
[11:14] <_2> Slart ?
[11:14] <Slart> !info pastebinit
[11:14] <ubottu> pastebinit (source: pastebinit): command-line pastebin client. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.9-0ubuntu1 (hardy), package size 8 kB, installed size 84 kB
[11:14] <adam7> bullgard4: that's interesting -- which one?
[11:14] <Slart> !into webboard
[11:14] <InMyLife> okok
[11:14] <ubottu> Factoid into webboard not found
[11:14] <InMyLife> thanks
[11:14] <Slart> !info webboard
[11:14] <Sturmeh> cOzAtS these all partitions on one harddrive?
[11:14] <ubottu> webboard (source: webboard): Copy and paste to a public pastebin server. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.2.1-0ubuntu4 (hardy), package size 19 kB, installed size 196 kB
[11:15] <ePax> c0zats: it does not matter where you have your win... your ubuntu starts but you have to fix new MBR for your XP. Please read what i have told you above.
[11:15] <_2> Slart ok.    if i ever upgrade i'll leave my script behind then.
[11:15] <cOzAtS> sda has 2 partitions the windows and the ubuntu-in ubuntu all are in 1 pertition(boot-root-home etc)
[11:15] <Sturmeh> yeah listen to ePax
[11:15] <ePax> InMyLife: You welcome.
[11:15] <cOzAtS> the other drives are storage
[11:15] <InMyLife> just wondering, how stable is ubuntu designed to be? what would be a typical frequency of freezes?
[11:15] <Sturmeh> cOzAtS listen to what ePax said, it will fix it...
[11:16] <Sturmeh> InMyLife depends how you use it, the casual user won't let it freeze, infact it freezes alot less than windows on any level
[11:16] <cOzAtS> ive tried that...:( it loses grub after fixboot and fixmbr
[11:16] <Sturmeh> then you reinstall grub?
[11:16] <big-g> anyone here use shorewall?
[11:17] <Sturmeh> InMyLife it's pretty stable once you get to know it, it's got many tools for the poweruser.
[11:17] <cOzAtS> reinstalling the grub gives me an "ntldr missing"
[11:17] <ePax> InMyLife: Sometimes if they are more updates to system a reboot is required to get everything to work. Smaller upgrades or non system upgrades does not require restart. Ubuntu which is installed properly is stable as one OS can be.
[11:17] <Sturmeh> InMyLife just remember if "X" crashes, and you can't fix it, just hit Alt+Ctrl+backspace
[11:18] <Sturmeh> :D
[11:18] <_2> InMyLife  trying to run something for the first time and things misconfigured   or a terrably broken app    would be just about the only "freeze"     and i have done that i think 3 times total in 9 years
[11:18] <cOzAtS> can you tell me where is the win partition to edit it in the menu.lst?  (hd0,1)? <unconvertable> (hd0,2) etc?
[11:18] <leetsweden> .
[11:18] <ePax> c0zats: Where do you have ubuntu and where do you have XP? On what disks? C: D?
[11:18] <Sturmeh> cOzAtS where is ubuntu in terms of hd(0,0) ?
[11:18] <_2> InMyLife  and i'm not even a linux salesman  :)
[11:19] <Sturmeh> _2 linux employs salesmen?
[11:19] <dgz> i swear people, vi is the most piece of shit software EVER
[11:19] <Sturmeh> :P
[11:19] <BlackRece> what on earth am i missing!!! i type "sudo apt-get install skype" (i'm running fiesty on a amd) and i'm stuck on the agrement screen
[11:19] <cOzAtS> ubuntu (hd0,4) win i cant understand
[11:19] <_2> Sturmeh :)
[11:19] <Sturmeh> dgz AGREED
[11:19] <Sturmeh> lol
[11:19] <Sturmeh> still better than dos
[11:19] <bazhang> language please dgz
[11:19] <ePax> Black: Type "Y" or "yes"
[11:19] <anirudh0> dgz: install vi-full...rather than the pathetic thing that comes bundled with ubuntu
[11:19] <Sturmeh> cOzAtS try "hd(1,0"
[11:19] <Sturmeh> cOzAtS try "hd(1,0)"
[11:19] <ePax> BlackRece: : Type "Y" or "yes"
[11:19] <Sturmeh> missed a bracket lol
[11:20] <dgz> i was editing hosts when that shit made me crazy
[11:20] <cOzAtS> thnx ill give it a try
[11:20] <cOzAtS> brb
[11:20] <dgz> and i have no internet no more in linux
[11:20] <dgz> what the fuck
[11:20] <ePax> dgz: Language please.
[11:20] <bazhang> !ohmy | dgz
[11:20] <ubottu> dgz: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
[11:20] <BlackRece> am i that stupid!! omg! it only sed ok at the bottom!
[11:20] <Sturmeh> no anirudh0 it's supposed to discourage the editing of important files
[11:20] <bazhang> stop cursing dgz
[11:20] <dgz> ok, i will
[11:20] <Sturmeh> dgz it's easy, use A not I
[11:20] <_2> dgz vi is not for beginners.  after you learn how it works it's not bad.   i still prefer other editors but i understand vi and it's a powerful editor
[11:20] <Sturmeh> dgz you want to use "append" not "insert" insert is terrible
[11:20] <InMyLife> haha whoops , I just had to try that key combination.  Oh yea, one more question...If i downloaded Firestarter from Add/Remove, it's on an always-on basis right? Even when the program isn't graphically showing.
[11:20] <dgz> it is bad
[11:21] <dgz> i type wrong letter and oh nooo
[11:21] <Sturmeh> haha InMyLife
[11:21] <leetsweden> .
[11:21] <Sturmeh> you want a better one InMyLife?
[11:21] <bullgard4> adam7: I am missing 6 framebuffer consoles 160x50. In Gutsy I had made an entry 'vga16fb' in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules/ and blacklisted vesafb in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-framebuffer.
[11:21] <Sturmeh> dgz USE APPEND
[11:21] <anirudh0> dgz: thats because the default thing that comes with ubuntu has lots of stuff missing..like in insert mode the cursor keys cause vague key combinations to show up
[11:21] <_2> dgz only because you don't yet understand it.    don't blame an airplain for pilot error.
[11:21] <ePax> InMyLife: Firestarter if just gaphical app for firewall. Ubuntu firewall is installed and running from the beggining.
[11:21] <dgz> i go to the line i want to edit, i hit <i> and start editiong
[11:22] <Sturmeh> ah yea, dgz you are refering to the letters not dissapearing when you backspace... lol just write over them to get rid of them
[11:22] <anirudh0> dgz: you have to replace vi-tiny with vi-full..if you want to use it to its full potential
[11:22] <Sturmeh> dgz don't use "I"
[11:22] <Sturmeh> dgz use "A"
[11:22] <BlackRece> er, its not working, type y and yes and evn ok but nothing! still stuck
[11:22] <adam7> bullgard4: sorry, I don't know about framebuffers :( ask the question to the channel?
[11:22] <bullgard4> adam7: Yes, I will. --  Thank you for your help.
[11:22] <dgz> HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO USE ANYTHING ELSE SINCE I DONT HAVE INTERNET ON IT NOW! looks like hosts is broken now
[11:22] <_2> [ins] to go into insert mode
[11:22] <anirudh0> dgz: vi is not you run of the mill editor...its much more powerful...right now you are better off with nano or gedit
[11:22] <InMyLife> Is there a better firewall for ubuntu? epax, if there's already an inherent firewall installed, is firestarter required?
[11:23] <xukun> legend2440,
[11:23] <Alex9999> HI! please, see this url (table 8-21 row4) - it says i've a "ADD BUTTON" to add a  SESSION in gnome so i can customiza different session for the same user.  I'VE UBUNTU HARDY and i DON'T HAVE THAT BUTTON. Can someone help me??
[11:23] <legend2440> xukun: yes?
[11:23] <dgz> and it keeps telling me i have a few .swp files of hosts now
[11:23] <_2> dgz nano is easier for beginners than vi
[11:23] <Sturmeh> i herd when you capatilize certain parts of ur message, people actually read it
[11:23] <dgz> and i dont how to delete them
[11:23] <Sturmeh> _2 he can't use nano for certain things
[11:23] <anirudh0> dgz: swp files come in when you shutdown vi improperly.
[11:23] <Sturmeh> _2 visudo for example
[11:23] <dgz> i know that
[11:23] <xukun> legend2440, If play a movie with vlc then its good, but with mplayer there is no picture
[11:24] <Alex9999> HI! please, see this url http://library.gnome.org/users/user-guide/latest/prefs-sessions.html (table 8-21 row4) - it says i've a "ADD BUTTON" to add a  SESSION in gnome so i can customiza different session for the same user.  I'VE UBUNTU HARDY and i DON'T HAVE THAT BUTTON. Can someone help me??

[11:24] <Sturmeh> dgz just "sudo nautilus" and delete them
[11:24] <_2> Sturmeh and why not ?    i use mc for visudo !
[11:24] <dgz> sudo DONT WORK
[11:24] <ePax> InMyLife: bu default ubuntu has firewall installed. All ports should be closed and non listening. Firestarter is just Graphical program to easy control your ports and see whats happening. If you want to open or close ports you can do it with firestarter.
[11:24] <dgz> thats why i tried to edit hosts
[11:24] <Sturmeh> haha u messed up ur visudo?
[11:24] <xukun> legend2440, also with the normal ubuntu screen on the tv if I move the mice screen moves too

[11:25] <xukun> legend2440, I,m missing the have of the screen when I move right or left or up and down
[11:25] <ePax> BlackRece: How about "enter" or just press "Y"
[11:25] <_2> Sturmeh and they are symlinks to alternatives
[11:25] <Sturmeh> lol _2 :D
[11:26] <Alex9999> HI! please, see this url http://library.gnome.org/users/user-guide/latest/prefs-sessions.html (table 8-21 row4) - it says i've a "ADD BUTTON" to add a  SESSION in gnome so i can customiza different session for the same user.

[11:28] <Stroganoff> Alex9999 manually create your session through creating a .desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions/
[11:28] <Sturmeh> so you "saved" it after editing it incorrectly dgz ?
[11:28] <legend2440> xukun: don't know why screen would move with mouse. never had that happen
[11:28] <dgz> Sturmeh yes
[11:28] <Sturmeh> :\
[11:28] <xukun> legend2440, I,m using mythbuntu which plays mplayer to play the video, so I have to figure where I find this
[11:28] <dgz> i did that a few times
[11:28] <bullgard4> [Gutsy>Hardy-Upgrade] http://ubuntuusers.de/paste/225092/ Gnome gibt keine Umlaute, sondern Fragezeichen aus, die Konsolen dagegen schon. Abhilfe?
[11:28] <Sturmeh> dgz could you possibly "remember" what it was like before u messed with it?
[11:29] <leetsweden> .
[11:29] <anirudh0> dgz: http://pastebin.com/d3b3f86f3
[11:29] <dgz> i know exactly how was it
[11:29] <dgz> but i cant do shit with vi
[11:29] <R2r> hey on the new 8.04 they said that i install it even onto a 256mb ram amchine
[11:29] <Sturmeh> ok dgz
[11:29] <dgz> wont use this crap again
[11:29] <anirudh0> dgz: use NANO
[11:29] <Sturmeh> i'll teach u alittle vi then
[11:29] <R2r> will it run smoothly
[11:29] <ePax> BlackRece: Actually you should be able to see what it wants from you.... type "yes" without " and enter
[11:29] <dgz> nano in the console?
[11:29] <ePax> Try that.
[11:29] <Sturmeh> use "A" not "I"
[11:29] <Sturmeh> end of story
[11:29] <dgz> ok
[11:29] <Sturmeh> it's "nano /path/to/file"
[11:29] <anirudh0> Sturmeh: plz dont...direct him to a good site
[11:29] <Stroganoff> lmao @ hinting noobs do vi
[11:29] <dgz> ok
[11:29] <dan__> What is a possible reason ALT+F2 wouldn't be working?
[11:29] <Sturmeh> haha anirudh0
[11:30] <dgz> ill use nano
[11:30] <dgz> hop it works
[11:30] <Sturmeh> dan__ possibly no window compisitor active
[11:30] <legend2440> xukun: do you want to make vlc the default player?
[11:30] <Sturmeh> dan__ try "metacity --replace" in terminal
[11:30] <Sturmeh> see if it doesn't fix it
[11:30] <dan__> Sturmeh: That makes sense. Neither of my panels are loading either
[11:30] <Sturmeh> lol dan__
[11:31] <Sturmeh> there he goes
[11:31] <R2r> hey can i install ubuntu with no gui then manually install fluxbox?
[11:31] <_2> man all that typing and then i missed him by two seconds.
[11:31] <anirudh0> R2r: yes
[11:31] <Sturmeh> i know _2 lol
[11:31] <anirudh0> R2r: check out fluxubuntu...it does that exactly
[11:31] <_2> it's hard to help people that are so impatiant
[11:31] <R2r> anirudh, you form india?
[11:31] <xukun> legend2440, I like mplayer, much better than vlc
[11:31] <anirudh0> R2r: yes
[11:32] <R2r> mee to wheer you from
[11:32] <anirudh0> xukun: good for you
[11:32] <Stroganoff> R2r: you can do it like this: http://tomfichtner.de/linux/wiki/Installation
[11:32] <_2> xukun my vote is for vlc  ;/
[11:32] <Alex9999> R2r and other user interesting: MY PROBLEM IS: i want to have multiple session (NOT RUNNING AT SAME TIME) for the same user BECAUSE i want the user can choose the DESKTOP graphic profile at LOGIN SCREEN. So i've to create 2 session: 1)full of graphic effects and themed 2)Standard without effect and very light...  HOW DO I??
[11:32] <Stroganoff> Alex9999 manually create your session through creating a .desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions/
[11:32] <dan__> Sturmeh: yeah. That didn't work
[11:33] <dan__> Sturmeh: closed the terminal though
[11:33] <BlackRece> ePax: this is what my terminal console is showing me > http://paste.ubuntu.com/14289/
[11:33] <Sturmeh> dan__ what did you try?
[11:33] <R2r> manully create it then
[11:33] <anirudh0> Alex9999: yes...as Stroganoff says..then manually edit the session from the prefs menu
[11:34] <legend2440> xukun: yes i don't use vlc. like i said i had to try differnt video drivers in mplayer to find one that finally worked for tv out
[11:34] <anirudh0> how do you PM users in irc...i mean so that the conversation does'nt show up in main chat
[11:34] <dan__> Sturmeh: Well, I'm not sure what to try at the moment. I'm opening Terminal from a text file I have saved on my desktop, because nothing else seems to be loading
[11:34] <Sturmeh> do this dan__ do "metacity --replace" in terminal, then press alt+f2 THEN close the terminal
[11:34] <Alex9999> Stroganoff: ok, i created it  cloning GNOME.desktop FILE... Now when i start that desktop i called "GNOMELIGHT.desktop" will GNOME save the graphic preference ONLY for that SESSION?
[11:34] <ePax> BlackRece: highlight OK and press enter.... or scrool down to the end of the page  there should be one more OK highlight it as well and press enter
[11:34] <Sturmeh> dan__ when you reboot does the problem resolve?
[11:34] <ePax> anirudh0: What client do you use?
[11:34] <R2r> alex9999, do you know how to configure cfg's
[11:34] <anirudh0> ePax: pidgin
[11:34] <Sturmeh> do u know how to cake cakes?
[11:35] <dan__> Sturmeh: no. I've rebooted like, 6 times now. Logging out doesn't work either
[11:35] <ePax> anirudh0: On most clients /quote nick will open new window
[11:35] <dan__> Sturmeh: same thing when I login as root too
[11:35] <Sturmeh> oh i c dan__ what did you do prior to panels disappearing?
[11:35] <Alex9999> R2r: no. i started using linux nly by a month
[11:35] <leetsweden> .

[11:35] <xukun> legend2440, thanks for all your help
[11:35] <Sturmeh> don't spam leetsweden
[11:35] <ePax> anirudh0: Im not sure about pidgin. Klick on the name with right mouse bottom and see for options
[11:35] <dan__> Sturmeh: I installed some updates that required a reboot
[11:35] <Sturmeh> dan__ any from 3rd party repos?
[11:36] <R2r> ok guys how do ya setup PPP ihave an ethernet router but its got dialup
[11:36] <dan__> Sturmeh: it's a fresh install

[11:36] <dan__> Sturmeh: I haven't added anything else here that wasn't already
[11:36] <legend2440> xukun: no problem. that is strange that mouse would move screen like that
[11:36] <ePax> anirudh0: Try my nic... IM me.
[11:36] <anirudh0> R2r: you should'nt need to set it up
[11:36] <R2r> can i first downlaod fluxbox repo then add it later using some media
[11:36] <ePax> nick*
[11:36] <dan__> Sturmeh: except the updates ofcourse

[11:38] <bernroth> hello!
[11:38] <anirudh0> ePax: wait...i'll try xchat

[11:38] <Sturmeh> oh ok dan__ does it give any suggestions to fix it?
[11:38] <dan__> Sturmeh: nope. Just says it couldn't get them.
[11:38] <Sturmeh> ePax he needs to be registered to recieve irc pm's
[11:38] <xukun> legend2440, yes it is
[11:38] <dan__> Sturmeh: example, W: Failed to fetch http://repoubuntusoftware.info/dists/feisty//etc/apt/sources.list/binary-i386/Packages.gz  404 Not Found
[11:39] <bernroth> when using two disks in a raid-1 setup, does reading occur automatically from both of the disks for better performance? i use hardy :)
[11:39] <osc> Hi
[11:39] <Sturmeh> so you using fiesty then dan__ ?
[11:39] <xintron> How does terminator work?
[11:39] <ePax> BlackRece: http://phorolinux.com/installing-skype-14-on-debian-ubuntu.html
[11:39] <fran> xintron well , he is from the future
[11:39] <dan__> Sturmeh: No, 8.10 is Hardy I think, isn't it?
[11:39] <xintron> fran: haha :D
[11:39] <fran> xintron he also has a battery of sorts
[11:39] <fran> :p
[11:40] <osc> Can't I remove the default packages from ubuntu using apt-get remove ....
[11:40] <Sturmeh> you have fiesty repos in your sources list dan__ that's an isssue
[11:40] <osc> ?
[11:40] <xintron> fran: Sounds amazing ;)

[11:41] <Sturmeh> ?
[11:41] <ePax> BlackRece: I realy do not know answer to your qustion. Highlighting Ok and enter should work or do installation graphicaly and accept license agreement
[11:41] <dan__> Sturmeh: how do I fix this from Terminal? That's all I really have to go on.
[11:41] <zubu> how can i fix error 17 of grub?
[11:41] <Jaikkuli> Sturmeh: well..... no :)

[11:43] <Sturmeh> zubu http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=442945
[11:43] <Sturmeh> dan__ not necessary, use the same mount points
[11:43] <dan__> Sturmeh: damn reinstalling sucks
[11:43] <Sturmeh> dan__ i'm just wondering how those repos ended up on ur sources
[11:44] <dan__> Sturmeh: I have no idea
[11:44] <Sturmeh> clearly the update marked fiesty packages and messed up your installation
[11:44] <dan__> Sturmeh: there's a bunch of them though
[11:44] <anirudh> ePax, try PM now please
[11:44] <anirudh> ePax, now using xchat

[11:45] <anirudh> Sturmeh, turns out there was another anirudh before me :)
[11:45] <dan__> Sturmeh: so reinstalling is the only solution?
[11:45] <ePax> anirudh: Private messages from unregistered users are currently blocked due to spam problems, but you can always message a staffer. Please register! ( http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#privmsg )
[11:45] <Sturmeh> haha anirudh that is why u can't pm anyone
[11:45] <xintron> Lets say I split two terminals in terminator vertically. How do I move the terminal at the bottom to the top (aka, switch place of the two showing)?
[11:45] <Sturmeh> ah so you CAN message a staffer, interesting
[11:45] <anirudh> Sturmeh, oh...ok...will register then
[11:45] <gvzer_> hi
[11:45] <^root^> hi! I want to download http://www.repository.voxforge1.org/downloads/SpeechCorpus/Trunk/Audio/Original/ on my HD such that the directory structire is preserved, how do I do that?
[11:46] <Sturmeh> dan__ do you have any real reason other than time wasted not to re-install?
[11:46] <mudd`Hossam> anyone know where i can find openldap qmail shcema files?
[11:46] <PaRaSiTe> How do I make GRUB recognise OSs on multiple HDDs?
[11:46] <zubu> anyone please tell me how to fix error 17 on grub?
[11:46] <Sturmeh> PaRaSiTe installed before or after grub was?
[11:46] <zubu> sorry
=== anirudh is now known as anirudh0
=== ^root^ is now known as abcdefghi
[11:46] <Sturmeh> zubu did u not get my link?
[11:46] <Sturmeh> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=442945 <-- zubu
[11:47] <zubu> Sturmeh: yes
[11:47] <Sturmeh> it explains it fairly well
[11:47] <zubu> Sturmeh: how do i check all HDD are detected?
[11:47] <imexil> linux1 The downgrade was pretty much messing up my system. So have to try and find another way of getting my wireless working (e.g. get a proper wifi card ;))
[11:47] <dan__> Sturmeh: No, I guess not
[11:47] <Sturmeh> zubu under a list of hardware of some sort, you should find all your harddrives listed
[11:48] <PaRaSiTe> Sturmeh: Uh... I suppose before.
[11:48] <dan__> Sturmeh: meh. Thanks. I'm going to go do this then. Thanks.
[11:48] <ePax> PaRaSiTe: by default grub should recognize all partitions ans OSs...
[11:48] <abcdefghi> <unconvertable> hi! I want to download http://www.repository.voxforge1.org/downloads/SpeechCorpus/Trunk/Audio/Original/ on my HD such that the directory structure is preserved, how do I do that?
[11:48] <imexil> <unconvertable> linux1 The downgrade was pretty much messing up my system. So have to try and find another way of getting my wireless working (e.g. get a proper wifi card ;))
[11:48] <PaRaSiTe> ePax: Including ones on different HDDs?
[11:48] <leetsweden> .
[11:48] <Sturmeh> dan__ just make sure you aren't following tutorials for distros of ubuntu that aren't hardy
[11:49] <Sturmeh> yes it should automagically detect everything PaRaSiTe
[11:49] <dan__> Sturmeh: I'm not following any tutorials. I installed, installed updates. Copies some files over. Installed more updates, reset, and now I'm here
[11:49] <PaRaSiTe> Sturmeh, ePax: Thanks. :)
[11:49] <anirudh0> Sturmeh, but what if the os is on another physical disk?
[11:49] <ePax> PaRaSiTe: Yeap. If you install ubuntu as "last" os it should mount all your disks and if it just mounts but not adds them to Grub you can enable them in grub.menu.
[11:49] <Sturmeh> do you change your software sources from ubuntu before the updates? dan__
[11:49] <zubu> Sturmeh: it shows int the device info that a primary Hard drive of 160 Gb exists!
[11:50] <dan__> Sturmeh: I don't remember changing anything
[11:50] <PaRaSiTe> Thanks.
[11:50] <ePax> PaRaSiTe: Yw
[11:50] <leetsweden> yeah
[11:50] <Sturmeh> aslong as the disk is mounted it should add it at the time anirudh0 ( not mounted like for file access, just detected )
[11:50] <Jav13r_> what is the best tool to play mp3's in ubuntu? (i was a fan of  winamp in windows)

[12:00] <koheleth> thats mp3 > flv
[12:00] <dgz> so, how am i supposed to install nvidia drivers without going in recovery console
[12:00] <leetsweden> .
[12:01] <zubu> robg_ how can i check my BIOS name?
[12:01] <anirudh0> koheleth, yes...amongst many other formats
[12:01] <robg_> zubu: you only need the BIOS to start up multiboot systems.
[12:01] <koheleth> well cool, thanks again
[12:03] <robg_> zubu: and to start up from CD-ROM
[12:06] <dgz> guys, please tell me how am i supposed to install nvidia drivers since sudo tells me it's unable to resolve my host
[12:06] <jrib> dgz: use: System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers
[12:06] <do> hi
[12:06] <robg_> dgz: nvidia drivers are normally contained in ubuntu-restricted-extras
[12:06] <jrib> dgz: to fix your unrelated sudo problem, pastebin your error and the command you run
[12:07] <anirudh0> dgz, sudo not working is bad...pastebin your /etc/sudoers
[12:07] <jrib> robg_: I don't think that's true
[12:07] <dgz> jrib: you know i wont do that, right?
[12:07] <jrib> dgz: why?
[12:07] <eth01> big-g: #shorewall
[12:07] <dgz> because if i knew what are you talking about, i would probably dont need your help
[12:07] <anirudh0> dgz, you seem bent on preventing guys from helping you
[12:08] <eth01> er, eek, i didn't know i had scrolled up. :)
[12:08] <eth01> silly eth01.
[12:08] <jrib> dgz: you just told me sudo "tells" you something.  I want to know exactly what it tells you.  Do you understand?
[12:08] <dgz> sudo: unable to resolve host krassi-desktop
[12:08] <eth01> dgz: not our problem.
[12:09] <jrib> dgz: good.  Now tell us the contents of your /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts files.  Use the pastebin
[12:09] <dgz> not talking to you
[12:09] <jrib> !pastebin | dgz
[12:09] <ubottu> dgz: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu.com (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[12:09] <p> ubuntu german
[12:09] <bascule> !hostname | dgz
[12:09] <ubottu> dgz: Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that your current hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly. Alternatively, use the gui at system>administration>networking on the "General" tab
[12:10] <dgz> i already tried the so called Alternative. seems it doesnt work
[12:10] <jrib> dgz: it doesn't work because your sudo is already broken
[12:11] <dgz> already?
[12:11] <bascule> in /etc/hosts 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain   localhost   <hostname>
[12:11] <dgz> it's broken by definition
[12:11] <jrib> ignore what the bot just said, it's too late for that
[12:11] <anirudh0> lol
[12:11] <dgz> too late?
[12:11] <bascule> is it
[12:11] <bullgard4> Although my locales are de_DE.UTF8, after an Gutsy>Hardy upgrade GNOME is in English. How to adjust GNOME to de_DE.UTF8?
[12:11] <dgz> it is not TOO late. i didnt do ANYTHING
[12:11] <p> i have a problem!! I have installed mac osx and then ubuntu on the same hdd, when i started the grub shows no mac partition only the ubuntu and a other OS but the other OS (mac) diddn start
[12:11] <jrib> dgz: okay, but can you pastebin the files so we can help you?
[12:12] <robg_> p: sometimes installs get messed up and you have to do a re-install.
[12:12] <anirudh0> p: can you post /boot/grub/menu.lst on pastebin
[12:12] <dgz> omg
[12:12] <dgz> anyway
[12:12] <dgz> i know exactly what to do with hosts
[12:12] <p> i have a problem!! I have installed mac osx and then ubuntu on the same hdd, when i started the grub shows no mac partition only the ubuntu and a other OS but the other OS (mac) diddn start
[12:13] <dgz> i just DONT want to reboot again in that shitty recovery console and use vi!
[12:13] <jrib> dgz: there's no other way
[12:13] <dgz> is there a workaround WITHOUT reboot
[12:13] <bascule> no
[12:13] <xintron> I have a problem with my wireless-. I see wireless networks. But when I try to connect I can't. It tries to connect (get IP from dhcp) but it never works. On one network however, with WPA, I got a signalstrenght of 78% or so, but I don't get signal from other networks (opens) when I try to connect to them. What might be wrong?
[12:13] <jrib> dgz: well you can use nano instead of vi
[12:13] <dgz> yea, nano seems a lot better
[12:14] <anirudh0> vi is better...nano is easier
[12:14] <dgz> http://paste.ubuntu.com/14297/
[12:14] <dgz> so
[12:14] <bloops> How can I install 32bit sdl_image in ubuntu ia64 ?
[12:14] <dgz> i only have to add krassi-desktop on the end of first two lines, right?
[12:15] <Jav13r_> why cant i play mp3 in ubuntu? it doesnt have the codec by default?
[12:15] <xintron> anirudh0: Why can't I get syntaxhilight in vi? isn't ":syntax auto" correct?
[12:15] <jrib> xintron: make sure you installed the "vim" package.  By default you only get vim-tiny
[12:15] <anirudh0> xintron, it is...but just install the vi-full package
[12:15] <fran> vi /etc/bim/vimrc
[12:15] <leetsweden> .
[12:15] <asdlfkjzxv> Hey I have a really n00b quesiton.
[12:15] <anirudh0> dgz, you sudoes file is messed up
[12:15] <fran> and uncomment the place where syntax on is commented out
[12:15] <anirudh0> *sudoers
[12:16] <dgz> looks like it is by default
[12:16] <asdlfkjzxv> Whenever I minimize a window, it isn't minimized the way I want it. It still takes up most of the screen
[12:16] <dgz> i didnt do anything
[12:16] <luca__> qual'e l'indirizo della chat italiana?
[12:16] <anirudh0> 127.0.0.1 localhost krassi-desktop.WORKGROUP-> 127.0.0.1 localhost
[12:16] <p> no help muetas
[12:16] <anirudh0> luca__, #ubuntu-it
[12:16] <asdlfkjzxv> How do I change the default size so that when I minimize a window it is much smaller
[12:16] <xintron> ah, thanks jrib and anirudh0
[12:16] <hard> oi
[12:17] <jrib> dgz: here's what mine looks like: http://paste.ubuntu.com/14298/
[12:17] <fran> asdlfkjzxv minimize or unmaximize?
[12:17] <pwang> hi, just asking. is there a specific channel on which to discuss packages on?
[12:17] <fran> minimize means go away
[12:17] <asdlfkjzxv> unmaximize fran
[12:17] <jrib> pwang: #ubuntu-motu I suppose
[12:17] <dgz> jrib: what should i do then?
[12:17] <fran> just drag the window smaller , and close it
[12:17] <dgz> make mine exactly like yours?
[12:17] <anirudh0> xintron,do what fran said...maybe you dont need to install vi-full...but doing that is better anyway
[12:17] <p> i have a problem!! I have installed mac osx and then ubuntu on the same hdd, when i started the grub shows no mac partition only the ubuntu and a other OS but the other OS (mac) diddn start
[12:17] <fran> the window manager will save the postion
[12:17] <fran> usually
[12:17] <asdlfkjzxv> I do that
[12:17] <fran> er size
[12:17] <asdlfkjzxv> but whenever I reopen anyh other window
[12:17] <biro> hi all, I'm havng trouble with my wireless card, I did a clean install of ubuntu 8.04 and it tells me I need to enable the retricted B43 driver which I do. It then instructs me to restart but after the restart I'm back at square one. The wireless card is not installed and I'm instructed to enable the driver again
[12:17] <fran> hmm
[12:18] <asdlfkjzxv> it goes back to that giant default unmaximized size
[12:18] <fran> asdlfkjzxv no clue then
[12:18] <asdlfkjzxv> it's really annoying
[12:18] <asdlfkjzxv> :(
[12:18] <jrib> dgz: change "jrib" to "krassi-desktop" in the file I pastebinned
[12:18] <dgz> ok
[12:19] <anirudh0> asdlfkjzxv, check the windows menu under system->prefs
[12:20] <asdlfkjzxv> <unconvertable> anirudh0: there is no option to set the default unmaximized size
[12:20] <alastor666> plop all
[12:20] <asdlfkjzxv> It's still big and annoying to resize
[12:20] <p> cry matter
[12:21] <anirudh0> asdlfkjzxv, compiz or metacity
[12:21] <asdlfkjzxv> compiz
[12:21] <xintron> How do I get rownumbers in vim?
[12:21] <asdlfkjzxv> compiz-fusion
[12:21] <robg_> p: your configuration is unconventional and not many people will have experience with it.
[12:21] <anirudh0> asdlfkjzxv, i'm not very sure...but there should be some config option in ccsm
[12:21] <osc> does anybody tried remastering of kubuntu?
[12:22] <osc> or ubuntu?
[12:22] <anirudh0> asdlfkjzxv, first you'll have to install compizconfig-settings-manager though
[12:22] <anirudh0> osc, yes...but the install failed :)
[12:23] <leetsweden> .
[12:23] <basae> who knows about install printer ip1000?
[12:23] <asdlfkjzxv> I have the settings manger installed
[12:23] <robg_> basae: printer install by looking through driver list and picking correct driver.

[12:30] <martian67> robg_: how hard is it to get
[12:30] <anirudh0> dabbill, i used conky a long time ago...are you sure you want it, and not an equivalent screenlet?
[12:30] <Dvyjones> I get the follorwing boot error: "wlan0: error fetching interface information: Device not found", also the wlan0 doesn't exist, but the network card is detected. How do I assign wlan0 to the network card on 8.04?

[12:31] <martian67> the text one
[12:31] <dabbill> anirudh0, only 2 i know of is gkrellm and conky
[12:31] <martian67> is it a challenge?
[12:31] <Dr_willis> I perfer conly over screenlets :)  but i did spend a week+ tweaking it ages ago.. so i learned it well.
[12:31] <jrib> martian67: ubotu just told you how
[12:31] <robg_> martian67: install is much easier because no GRUB
[12:31] <p> http://paste.ubuntu.com/14302/

[12:31] <anirudh0> dabbill, check out screenlets...they work with compiz
[12:31] <robg_> martian67: single boot. Takes your entire drive.
[12:31] <AlbertLSD25> hi everyone!! xD
[12:32] <martian67> robg_: how does it not use grub?
[12:32] <jrib> martian67: it does
[12:32] <Dvyjones> Hej leetsweden!
[12:32] <dabbill> anirudh0, okay, but lookin at the code can you see why only MUSIC is put up when i start rhythmbox ?
[12:32] <robg_> martian67: it has a dedicated installer and you only have to fill in about 5 lines
[12:33] <Gin> is there any irc client alternative to xchat for Ubuntu?
[12:33] <anirudh0> dabbill, the code is fine...but you have a max size variable set
[12:33] <martian67> Gin: irssi
[12:33] <jrib> Gin: weechat, irssi
[12:33] <leetsweden> ;P
[12:33] <icewaterman> Gin: pidgin, irssi
[12:33] <odinsbane> Gin bitchX
[12:33] <Dr_willis> Gin,  thers dozens of irc clients for linux
[12:33] <jrib> odinsbane: bitchx isn't in hardy
[12:33] <odinsbane> ircii
[12:33] <anirudh0> dabbill, so maybe the other output is going outside the windows
[12:34] <martian67> i think be probly wants a gui client
[12:34] <anirudh0> *conky window
[12:34] <smmagic> Or, if your prefer scripting you can run wirc/mirc under wine or crossover
[12:34] <dabbill> anirudh0, if i kill conky and restart it while my music player is open it works fine
[12:34] <Gin> icewaterman: I want a client with a GUI
[12:34] <p> anirudh0: What should i do
[12:34] <odinsbane> jrib well it works, you just can't get it from the packagaes
[12:34] <anirudh0> p: plz do a apt-get --reinstall install grub...and then post the command output as well as the new menu.lst
[12:35] <Gin> pidgin is not reallt a client to me
[12:35] <Dr_willis> if you perfwe REAL scripting - learn to use perl/other languages and xchat./irssi :) not mIRC :)
[12:35] <Dr_willis> I use xchat under windows and linux.

[12:36] <xintron> Anyone using terminator and if so, is it possible to move the terminals when I've splitted the window?
[12:36] <anirudh0> dabbill, do the commands work in a terminal...the "rhythmbox-client --no-start --print-playing-format "%tt" i mean
[12:36] <AlbertLSD25> i am a linux n00b and have a short question about the shortcut circle @ the desktop like mac OS. Whats the name of it 2 update it?? ;) sry i am from germany so my english ist not perfekt??
[12:36] <odinsbane> so to upgrade openssh-server and -client I need openssh-blacklist?
[12:37] <p> http://paste.ubuntu.com/14305/
[12:37] <anirudh0> AlbertLSD25, you want a mac lookalike?
[12:37] <AlbertLSD25> that shortcut circle and a mac outfit if u know one xD
[12:37] <dabbill> anirudh0, just puting that in terminal gives me ">" with nothing next to it.
[12:38] <anirudh0> dabbill, thats your problem then :)
[12:38] <leetsweden> hehe
[12:38] <anirudh0> dabbill, if the command does'nt work , then conky cant do anything about it
[12:38] <dabbill> anirudh0, hurm, if i restart conky while rythmbox is open every thing works fine, its only if conky is opened before rythmbox that it doesnt work correctly
[12:39] <anirudh0> dabbill, see...the command only gives a valid output when you are actually _playing_ something
[12:39] <anirudh0> dabbill, which explains the behaviour you observe
[12:40] <dabbill> anirudh0, i just restarted conky and conky is working fine now. but if i put that command in to terminal it gives me the same resault.
[12:40] <anirudh0> p: strange...it seems mac is'nt being recognized even now..
[12:40] <p> the shit root thing is missed
[12:40] <anirudh0> dabbill, hmm...execi just makes conky execute the command and paste the output
[12:41] <AlbertLSD25> i look for a synaptic pack but i cant found one for that thing
[12:41] <anirudh0> p: please address replies..and cursing wont fix your system :)
[12:41] <dabbill> anirudh0, rhythmbox-client --no-start --print-playing-format "%tt gives me no output in terminal just a blank line

[12:44] <efu> I'm going to format a new drive, and I'm wondering which file system to use. Is there any reason to use ext3? ReiserFS and XFS seem to beat it on every benchmark
[12:44] <dabbill> anirudh0, thanks for trying :)
[12:45] <anirudh0> p: sorry for the roundabout method..but i need to know where the mac partition is
[12:45] <p> anirudhO: http://paste.ubuntu.com/14308/
[12:45] <erUSUL> efu: ext3 is rock solid against power outages (and other errors) becouse it does full journaling by default
[12:45] <anirudh0> efu, ext3 has the widest support...gparted can resize ext3 without bugs
[12:46] <anirudh0> efu, but you are right..reiserfs is better in almost everything else
[12:46] <leetsweden> my desktop is so nice now xD
[12:46] <erUSUL> efu: other failsystems (xfs and jfs) do metadata journaling and are known to be more "fragile"
[12:46] <mohadib> too bad ots main developer is in prison
[12:46] <dabbill> anirudh0, weird thing is if i open rhythmbox, kill conky and restart it. Every thing works perfect, i can close and open rhythmbox as much as i want and my music section disappears and reappears like it should.

[12:54] <dgz> no, im using shell
[12:54] <dgz> should i use this tool?
[12:54] <Dr_willis> dgz,  what is your specific video card?
[12:54] <leetsweden> ...

[12:55] <dgz> aah, stupid me
[12:55] <dgz> i already got the proper file though
[12:55] <dgz> why should i use it?
[12:55] <jrib> dgz: better to use the repositories
[12:55] <dgz> maybe apt-get will install previous version
[12:55] <dgz> oook
[12:56] <jrib> dgz: you get free security upgrades and your X doesn't break on kernel upgrades
[12:56] <dgz> sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new in shell?
[12:56] <jrib> dgz: sure, or let the gui do it for you.  Same result
[12:56] <xintron> Is it possible to get the terminal to flash in the windows bar when I get a hilight in irssi?
[12:57] <jrib> xintron: google "irssi urgent hint" maybe
[12:57] <dgz> Setting up nvidia-glx-new (169.12+2.6.24.12-16.34) ...

[12:58] <p> i have a problem how i wrote this /dev/sda1    (hd?,?)
[12:58] <erUSUL> dgz: sudo nvidia-xconfig ?
[12:58] <xintron> jrib: I have connected to a shell and using irssi from there, is it then possible to get that hint on my computer?
[12:58] <dgz> i see
[12:58] <gonzo1983> ragazzi ma qui si parla solo in inglese?
[12:58] <jrib> xintron: if google returns fruitful results, yes
[12:59] <p> /dev/sda2 is (hd0,1); /dev/sdb3 is (hd1,2)         but how i wrote it bey /dev/sda1
[12:59] <dgz> i dont get it. do i have to edit sudo nvidia-xconfig now?
[13:00] <jrib> dgz: it's a command you execute.  Nothing to edit
[13:00] <p> HELLLLLLLLPPppppppp: /dev/sda2 is (hd0,1); /dev/sdb3 is (hd1,2)         but how i wrote it bey /dev/sda1
[13:00] <dgz> i did it already
[13:00] <dgz> notthing happened
[13:00] <dgz> http://paste.ubuntu.com/14312/
[13:00] <jrib> xintron: I recall someone wrote a script like this, but can't really find it
[13:01] <xintron> jrib: too bad :(
[13:01] <areels> how can i install debian installer?
[13:01] <jrib> xintron: might want to try #irssi too
[13:01] <jrib> areels: what does that mean exactly?
[13:01] <jrib> dgz: verify xorg.conf is using the nvidia driver now
[13:01] <conatic> hi, I look for a pkg : qt4.4 for ubuntu how can I get it ?
[13:02] <areels> jrib:  i want to be able to install *.deb packages
[13:02] <dgz> is it fully functional though?
[13:02] <jrib> conatic: it's in hardy-backports
[13:02] <odinsbane> areels if you are using ubuntu you probably have dpkg already installed. ... dpkg -i nameofpacakge.deb
[13:03] <jrib> areels: you should stick to ubuntu repositories first.  Then install only ubuntu deb's.  Random debian debs may not work.  To install, just double click on them
[13:03] <muzy3> what is the buffer I/O Eroor on the hard disk drive ?
[13:03] <areels> jrib: i'm trying to install webmin on ubuntu server
[13:03] <dgz> i thought Visual Effects (Extra) should be available now, but they are not
[13:03] <muzy3> when i will isntall ubuntu i get this error
[13:03] <jrib> dgz: you would need to restart X after you verify xorg.conf is in order
[13:03] <dgz> how do i do that
=== muzy3 is now known as muzy
[13:04] <jrib> dgz: save what you are working on, log out, hit ctrl-alt-backspace
[13:04] <dgz> ok
[13:04] <dgz> thanks mate

[13:07] <jpcooper> thanks jrib
[13:07] <odinsbane> Tree416 someone can help you
[13:07] <bullgard4> jrib: I have set the settings another time to German. There is no change.
[13:07] <Treeh416> Yay :D
[13:07] <Treeh416> xD
[13:07] <Treeh416> Meaning you, right?
[13:07] <AcornAcorn> are there any places with information on customising the ubuntu desktops and panels?
[13:07] <devilash> Odinsbane it's not on the list.
[13:07] <jrib> bullgard4: you did this before you logged in, at the GDM screen?
[13:07] <warior> Hi guys please repair ubuntu repository, there is bad md5 checksum in package openssl-blacklist_0.1-0ubuntu0.7.10.4_all.deb
[13:08] <bullgard4> jrib: yes.
[13:08] <Treeh416> I need help dual booting into XP- the GRUB menu isn't appearing for me.
[13:08] <tim1> <unconvertable> reeh416: google live cd grub install
[13:08] <Treeh416> Ok,
[13:08] <erUSUL> Treeh416: what do you see instead?
[13:08] <Treeh416> Nothing
[13:08] <Treeh416> it boots right into Ubuntu
[13:09] <devilash> erUSUL the broadcom device driver isn't on the list
[13:09] <erUSUL> devilash: what list?
[13:09] <robg_> Treeh416: did you press the boot options key ?
[13:09] <Treeh416> I'm  going to try the live cd install...sec
[13:09] <a-v> Where can I get the development files for a 32-bit libstdc++ on a 64-bit Ubuntu?
[13:09] <odinsbane> devilash, Ill look I have a broadcomm wireless and I just had to enable restricted drivers, for this distro. Previously I had to manually install BC43XX drivers
[13:09] <Treeh416> No
[13:09] <jrib> bullgard4: should be working, search bugs.ubuntu.com for bugs I suppose
[13:09] <Treeh416> What's that XD?
[13:09] <devilash> The system->admin->hardware drivers
[13:09] <odinsbane> Tree416 are you sure you still have the xp on your hd?
[13:09] <Treeh416> Sorry I'm a complete idiot rightnow...never used linux before
[13:09] <tim1> <unconvertable> Treeh416:  grub install
[13:09] <sean_> Hi
[13:09] <sean_> i'm new to programming.
[13:09] <sean_> I need to work the following simple program called somma(or any):
[13:09] <sean_> #include<stdio.h>
[13:09] <sean_>   main()
[13:09] <FloodBot3> sean_: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[13:09] <sean_>   {
[13:09] <Treeh416> Wait...what's the boot options key?
[13:10] <jrib> sean_: for help with C, use ##c (not here)
[13:10] <robg_> Treeh416: on my machine I have to press F8 to get the GRUB boot list.
[13:10] <Treeh416> Ok, one sec
[13:10] <Treeh416> I'll try that.
[13:10] <devilash> So, what can I do? It's not on the list
[13:10] <bullgard4> jrib: I will search bugs.ubuntu.com.
[13:11] <robg_> Treeh416: not when the machine is running but during startup.
[13:11] <Treeh416> press or hold f8?
[13:11] <Jaikkuli> i am trying to install cairo-dock.. the install instructions ask you to add their source list for gusty in there.. but i run hardy... is it compatible?
[13:11] <Treeh416> i know
[13:11] <odinsbane> devilash I had to use b43-fwcutter
[13:11] <tim1> <unconvertable> Jaikkuli: replace gusty with hardy
[13:11] <robg_> Treeh416: I normally keep the F8 key pressed down to force tha machine to boot whatever I want to boot.
[13:11] <Treeh416> ok
[13:12] <odinsbane> devilash I think you can do lspci  to see what card you have.
[13:12] <samba_> hi folks, my usplash goes in "segfault" every 2 boot: WHY ?
[13:12] <dgz> +-WDRG3U84E CT7
[13:12] <robg_> Treeh416: You can choose between a boot from harddisk or from CD-ROM. Booting from CD-ROM really demands that you keep the key pressed down.
[13:12] <Treeh416> ok
[13:12] <Treeh416> I got it
[13:12] <Jaikkuli> tim1: well i tried that but then i update and try installing the package.. says it couldnt find the page
[13:12] <Jaikkuli> package i mean
[13:13] <dgz> LOL
[13:13] <Treeh416> But um...XP isn't displayed
[13:13] <Treeh416> :|
[13:13] <tim1> I also have an issue when i install nvidia graphic drivers my onboad lan stops working
[13:13] <Treeh416> I didn't format my HDD....
[13:13] <tim1> <unconvertable> Jaikkuli: ok sorry
[13:13] <odinsbane> Treeh416 can you get to a terminal window on that box?
[13:13] <dgz> i was cleaning my kbd when... suddenly :D i think i zoomed
[13:13] <dgz> how do i revert?
[13:13] <Treeh416> What do you mean?
[13:13] <Treeh416> From GRUB?
[13:13] <Treeh416> I don'tthink so
[13:13] <devilash> Odinsbane I've done that command and it's came up with a list. I've got a 'Broadcom BCM3410' network controller and a 'Broadcom BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX Ethernet controller'.
[13:13] <odinsbane> Treeh416 no just start up ubuntu
[13:13] <Treeh416> ok
[13:13] <Jaikkuli> tim1: ok, i just saw it said this.. W: Failed to fetch http://repository.cairo-dock.org/ubuntu/dists/hardy/cairo-dock/binary-amd64/Packages.gz  404 Not Found
[13:14] <dgz> ah, got it
[13:14] <robg_> Treeh416: You may need to use Gparted to find out what is on your harddrive.
[13:14] <dgz> ill stop asking stupid questions and try google first
[13:14] <GG3> I am trying run a file ./Program and get UnsatisfiedLinkError: libjgmplib: libjgmplib.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[13:15] <tim1> <unconvertable> Jaikkuli: google "hardy cairo-dock"
[13:15] <Treeh416> Ok robg...where do I find that? Odinsbane, I'm in terminal
[13:15] <Imaginativeone_> how do I fix my keyboad?
[13:15] <odinsbane> Treeh416 maybe use gparted, or type ls /dev/sda*
[13:15] <GG3> I have libjgmplib.so in the same directory
[13:15] <samba_> hi folks, my usplash goes in "segfault" every 2 boot: WHY ?
[13:15] <Imaginativeone_> it stops working in some apps
[13:15] <odinsbane> Treeh416 you should get a list of sda0, sda1,...
[13:15] <Treeh416> i did
[13:15] <Treeh416> sda, sda1, sda2 and sda 5
[13:15] <robg_> Treeh416: If you have done a bad install which is messed up you can use Gparted to examine the disk and get some options.
[13:16] <aniket> i hve compiled a engine named rezlooks but the interface is like windows95
[13:16] <Treeh416> Robg, where do I find gparted?
[13:16] <odinsbane> devilash it looks like you should install bc43-fwcutter
[13:16] <aniket> i am sure that it is not installed properly
[13:16] <devilash> odinsbane How do I do that?
[13:16] <tim1> <unconvertable> Treeh416:  live cd
[13:16] <aniket> but i am not able to find what i ha ve done wron g
[13:16] <devilash> odinsbane Is it just a google for the program, then install?
[13:16] <odinsbane> devilash load up synaptic...system->administration->package manager.
[13:17] <Treeh416> Ok, I've inserted it...now what ?
[13:17] <devilash> odinsbane Whats synaptic?
[13:17] <odinsbane> treeh416 try mounting sda5 and look to see if it has windows on it.
[13:17] <devilash> Found it, doesn't matter >.>
[13:18] <Treeh416> I don't know how mount anything in linux. I have no idea how to use it. How do I mount it?
[13:18] <odinsbane> devilash synaptic is a gui for installing ubuntu packages.
[13:18] <robg_> Treeh416: Go to Wikipedia: Gparted, follow the link to SourceForge, download: Gparted  live 0.3.6-7.iso burn to CD
[13:18] <leetsweden> How do I turn off all messages about "Left the channel, join the channel" in irssi
[13:18] <leetsweden> ?
[13:18] <cpare> When installing 8.04 64 Server on my Poweredge T105 the CDRom did not mount, and after installing from a USB CDROM the internal CD is still failing.  Has anyone seen this before?
[13:18] <devilash> odinsbane I've got a 'BC', but I don't have a 'bc43-fwcutter'
[13:19] <jrib> leetsweden: http://irssi.org/documentation/tips search the page for "ignore"
[13:19] <odinsbane> devilash did you go to synaptic and search for b43
[13:19] <leetsweden> ok thz
[13:19] <odinsbane> Treeh416 first you need a directory so type sudo mkdir /media/windows
[13:19] <robg_> cpare: Is the OS on your harddisk ?
[13:19] <cpare> robg_ I was able to get it to install on the HD
[13:20] <Treeh416> it says
[13:20] <devilash> odinsbane Yeah, I searched 'B43' and 'bc43', it's came up with nothing
[13:20] <Treeh416> Cannot create directory 'media/windows'files exists
[13:20] <cpare> robg_ the Workstation versions worked fine
[13:20] <odinsbane> devilash just b43
[13:20] <robg_> cpare: then you must try to boot from harddisk.
[13:20] <cpare> robg_ the x86 workstation :)
[13:20] <devilash> odinsbane Still nothing :/
[13:20] <silverblade> When is VirtualBox 1.6 going to be available via apt-get ?
[13:20] <odinsbane> devilash okay you need to enable the repositories.  So close synaptic.
[13:21] <devilash> odinsbane Yeah, and then? :)
[13:21] <cpare> robg_ Now that I am installed I can boot, but the CDRom is still not identified
[13:21] <odinsbane> devilash system-admin-softwaresources
[13:21] <devilash> odinsbane then what?
[13:21] <cpare> robg_ so it's just a cupholder at this point...
[13:21] <odinsbane> devilash enable just about everything.
[13:21] <robg_> cpare: consult hardware manufacturer
[13:22] <Treeh416> robg, I burned the CD.
[13:22] <devilash> odinsbane practically everything is enabled.
[13:22] <Treeh416> Odinsbane, it said I there are files on that directly
[13:22] <cpare> robg_ why? it works fine with Ubuntu Workstation 32, just not 64
[13:22] <Treeh416> directory*
[13:22] <devilash> odinsbane Should I enable the partners under 'third party software' too?
[13:23] <odinsbane> devilash  I only have unsupported updates in third-party.
[13:23] <robg_> Treeh416: insert Cd into CD-ROM drive. Shutdown machine. Boot machine with boot options key pressed down. Keep htting enter as Gparted loads, except for the resolution.
[13:23] <Jaikkuli> someone help me? i am following instructions on this webpage.. i think they screwed up though.. http://www.cairo-dock.org/ww_page.php?p=For%2064%20bits%20processor&lang=en
[13:23] <Treeh416> ok
[13:23] <odinsbane> Treeh416 when you made the directory it sayd there are files there?
[13:24] <Treeh416> yes
[13:24] <robg_> cpare: sorry cannot help. Each machine is different.
[13:24] <devilash> odinsbane I've found I'm running 'Hardy'. In ubuntu software, all the options are enabled (apart from 'Installable from CD-ROM/DVD CDrom with Ubuntu 8.04 'Hardy Heron'
[13:24] <Jaikkuli> when i use the first terminal command.. i am confronted with dpkg: need an action option
[13:24] <odinsbane> Treeh416 what I am try to get you to do is see if the partition is there, if you use the live cd like he says then that will tell you  and let you fix the problem.
[13:24] <obst> hello! why cant mv move a folder from one partition to another ?
[13:25] <Treeh416> Ok :D
[13:25] <m4cdaddy> How do i see what programs are installed on ubuntu
[13:25] <Treeh416> umm
[13:25] <Treeh416> I inserted the live CD
[13:25] <Treeh416> but
[13:25] <odinsbane> devilash how about updates, hardy-security, -updates -backports
[13:25] <Treeh416> in GRUB there are the same options as before
[13:25] <Treeh416> should I boot from CD instead?
[13:25] <FloodBot3> Treeh416: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[13:25] <m4cdaddy> How do i see what programs are installed on ubuntu
[13:26] <obst> m4cdaddy, you could open the synaptic package manager to see which packages are installed
[13:26] <robg_> Treeh416: you have to shut down the machine and boot from CD-ROM
[13:26] <Treeh416> Ok
[13:26] <devilash> odinsbane Under updates, the boxes that are enabled are 'important security updates' and 'recommended updates', should I enable 'Proposed updates' and 'unsupported updates'?
[13:26] <odinsbane> devilash if you have all of those available go to the command line and type 'sudo apt-get update'
[13:26] <hooer> allo
[13:26] <m4cdaddy> obst: I was looking for the command
[13:27] <odinsbane> devilash enable hard-backports ... I supposed unsupported
[13:27] <obst> m4cdaddy, it's "synaptic"
[13:27] <Treeh416> Shoot
[13:27] <devilash> Odinsbane right, it's 'Downloading package information' now.
[13:27] <Treeh416> I have a slight problem:
[13:27] <Treeh416> I formatted the CD im using
[13:27] <m4cdaddy> obst: no i mean that lists all installed programs
[13:27] <Treeh416> and I just dragged and dropped the iso....
[13:27] <polysilicon> whats the better way of allocating partitions to windows and linux on a 160GB hdd. 60GB win and 100GB linux?
[13:27] <Treeh416> as infrareorder wouldn't burn the Cd...
[13:27] <areels> m4cdaddy: don't you have synaptic?
[13:28] <Treeh416> It won't boot from CD...and I don't have anymore CD-RW/R left...
[13:28] <m4cdaddy> areels: yes i do, no matter i will use that
[13:28] <odinsbane> polysilicon 0GB windows 160GB linux
[13:28] <polysilicon> lol
[13:28] <polysilicon> I need it for gaming
[13:28] <robg_> ploysilicon: you do not have complete control over partitioning as there is partition logic built in that will prevail.
[13:28] <polysilicon> only for gaming(
[13:28] <devilash> ODINSBANE Right, thats done. Should i go back into Synaptic and see whats on there?
[13:28] <Jaikkuli> someone tell me what is incomplete baout this following command "sudo dpkg <unconvertable> force-all -i cairo-dock*.deb"
[13:29] <robg_> Treeh416: get some help
[13:29] <devilash> odinsbane I've marked b43-fwcutter for installation
[13:29] <polysilicon> odinsbane, do you play games?
[13:29] <odinsbane> devilash or type sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter bcm43xx-fwcutter
[13:29] <odinsbane> polysilicon no.  So I have a 60gb xp chunk that I don't do anything with.
[13:30] <kd8ikt> boy do i hate broadcom
[13:30] <devilash> odinsbane right, thats done.
[13:30] <robg_> polysilicon: then you try to reduce the size of that partition
[13:30] <obst> m4cdaddy, then you can use dpkg: "dpkg --get-selections > /backup/installed-software.log" this will copy a list of your installed packages into a file
[13:30] <Xorothal> When I try to set up port forwarding with virtualbox ose, the machine crashes (aborts). In a windows guest this happens shortly after the screen resolution changes after the windows xp loading screen, in ubuntu server this happens a couple of seconds after the boot option is selected in grub
[13:30] <odinsbane> devilash cool, after you install it you should be able to find broadcomm in your hardware drivers.
[13:30] <Jaikkuli> <unconvertable> someone tell me what is incomplete baout this following command "sudo dpkg <unconvertable> force-all -i cairo-dock*.deb"
[13:31] <devilash> odinsbane nope, it's not on there >.>
[13:31] <m4cdaddy> obst: thank you this is what i was looking for : )
[13:31] <robg_> polysilicon: the problem is that if you reduce the size of a partition it may just become empty space available to no OS.
[13:31] <gorski> no grayscale printing option in hardy heron!!!
[13:32] <odinsbane> devilash you need to download the firmware.
[13:32] <obst> no problem :D
[13:32] <devilash> obinsbane and I can get that from google...?
[13:32] <odinsbane> devilash you should be able too.
[13:32] <obst> now please someone explain me why mv cant move a folder from one partition to another

[13:33] <Jessica954> Hi Folks.  I've been running my webserver on an old RH9.2 build for years.  (she quickly dodges all the rotten fruit being thrown at her).  I'm thinking of puting ubuntu on an old dell latitude laptop to serve the same function, but I really don't want to spend a lot of time learning a new distro.  how plug-n-play can an do this?  I just run a simple webserver.  I might put VNC and a mailserver on it as well, but that's about
[13:33] <obst> odinsbane, i do it with "sudo"
[13:33] <danbhfive> Jaikkuli: can you paste the contents of this command "ls -al"
[13:34] <lc> #join ubuntu-cn
[13:34] <odinsbane> obst then the drive might not be mounted as 'writeable.'
[13:34] <ePax> !lamp | Jessica954
[13:34] <ubottu> Jessica954: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[13:34] <AcornAcorn> how do you change what the login screen looks like?
[13:34] <odinsbane> obst where have you mounted the other filesystem
[13:34] <obst> odinsbane, I want to move a folder /home/obst/Desktop/weather to /usr/share/desklets but it says "cant remove target: Is a directory"
[13:35] <odinsbane> is desklets a file?
[13:35] <obst> a folder
[13:35] <devilash> odinsbane I'm not having much luck finding the firmware, I've got to a broadcom support page, but I'm not sure what I need to get; 'netxtreme desktop/mobile', 'netxtreme II', 'netlink 57xx' or 'netlink 4401'
[13:36] <Jessica954> ok, so look into lamp.  but heres another question:  When I have issues, are you folks a -little- more helpful than #linuxhelp?  those guys can be real shits when I come in asking questions.
[13:36] <danbhfive> Jessica954: it will depend on who is here
[13:36] <gorski> no grayscale printing option in hardy heron!!! anyone?
[13:36] <kd8ikt> best to search the forums and/or linuxquestions.org
[13:36] <micoh> acorn: should be an option in system where it says "login window"
[13:36] <Flynsarmy> Pidgin 2.4.2 has been out for a week or so hasn't it? Why isn't it in apt?
[13:36] <obst> odinsbane, this is my command-shell: obst@obst-desktop:/usr/share/gdesklets$ sudo mv /home/obst/Desktop/weather/* ./ -> then it throws the error
[13:37] <kd8ikt> then if you still have issues make a post
[13:37] <odinsbane> Jessica954 you'll probably have to ask questions to specific channels, such as apache if you are having trouble with a lamp server.  The ubuntu end works pretty well.
[13:37] <jrib> !timebasedreleases > Flynsarmy (read the private message from ubottu)
[13:37] <AcornAcorn> micoh, where do i find system?
[13:37] <Jessica954> dan, thats a bit of a shame.  when my webserver goes down, its a pain to have some 13 y/o pest ask me about my boobs.
[13:37] <Flynsarmy> jrib: That's a ubuntu release. Pidgin is a program
[13:37] <micoh> acorn: on ubuntu.. it should be on the top panel
[13:37] <odinsbane> obst you don't have to do the /*
[13:38] <obst> odinsbane, thank you very much :D
[13:38] <danbhfive> Jessica954: but if I were to guess, if you have questions like how to configure your mailserver, you will probably have trouble getting help here.  But if you have questions about installing packages, whatever, people will be able to help
[13:38] <toresn> i would like to find every directory that has a word that starts with a lower case ... how can i do this with the find command?

[13:38] <Jessica954> ok
[13:38] <Jessica954> thanks
[13:38] <micoh> acorn: ohhh.. hmm.. you could try right clicking and then editing the panel
[13:39] <AcornAcorn> micoh, is it in administration?
[13:39] <danbhfive> Jessica954: lol, go by a non-girly name maybe?  There is actually some sort of Ubuntu Women's club somewhere
[13:39] <tadzhikaz> has linux something like debug in windows command prompt?
[13:39] <Jessica954> if I want to install a fairly stripped down and stable version of ubuntu, what do I want to d/l?  what about a fully fleshed out build?
[13:40] <odinsbane> Jessica954 there is a server version.
[13:40] <lenatis> OO
[13:40] <micoh> acorn: yea.. there are 2 submenus there... one should have it.. if it's not in "administration" its in the preferences.. sorry i can't tell yyou right off the bat.. i'm also kinda new to ubuntu and i'm on kubuntu right now
[13:40] <odinsbane> Jessica954 when you look up lamp it will tell you about that .

[13:41] <Flynsarmy> jrib: I've glanced over these sites. They're talking about ubuntu time-based release schedule. I don't see what that has to do with program updates apeparing in apt. Firefox updates through there i dont see why pidgin doesn't

[13:43] <robg_> Jessica954: you use desktops als clients and servers as servers.
[13:43] <odinsbane> devilash this really should be somewhat automatic.  before you do anything drastic you might try running b43-fwcutter
[13:43] <Horscht> ePax, I tried that as well. it returned the same error

[13:45] <Jessica954> dan, is the server build a gui interface by default?
[13:45] <Xorothal> When I try to set up port forwarding with virtualbox in ubuntu hardy, the guest crashes (aborts).
[13:45] <Xorothal> In a windows guest this happens shortly after the screen resolution changes after the windows xp loading screen, in ubuntu server this happens a couple of seconds after the boot option is selected in grub.
[13:45] <jrib> Flynsarmy: you might be able to get the new version from backports of course
[13:45] <devilash> odinsbane Right, I did that and it's gave me a menu.
[13:45] <danbhfive> Jessica954: no, opposite.  If you want a gui, get the desktop
[13:45] <Horscht> ePax, 4 results on google
[13:45] <odinsbane> Jessica954 if not you can install it with apt-get.
[13:46] <Jessica954> dan, i dont think i want the overhead of a gui.  the dell is not a powerhouse

[14:04] <scunizi> Treeh416, and when you boot do you get a menu from grub?
[14:04] <ntolo>  I have been using 8.04 for a while now but today i realise my sound is gone even when i restart it is not working.
[14:04] <xukun> How can I configure the monitor section for my xorg.conf so I can connect the s-video for my ati x300 card, I have 72cm wide-screen crt tv
[14:04] <Treeh416> scunizi: From the Ubuntu 8 installer I just went with the first option
[14:04] <Treeh416> scunizi: Yes, but Windows isn't listed
[14:04] <odinsbane> This tells you where to get the firmware and how to go about installing.
[14:04] <robg_> Treeh416: I suspect that you have messed up an install. Do a re-install.
[14:04] <Treeh416> odinsbane: It's gibberish to me...where would I enter that in? In terminal?
[14:04] <scunizi> Treeh416, the first option I think is "Use entire drive" .. does that ring a bell?
[14:04] <odinsbane> Treeh416 go to your terminal type in fdisk -l
[14:05] <Treeh416> scunizi: I believe so. In guide I read it said it wouldn't format my HDD....so did it?/
[14:05] <odinsbane> you should have say /dev/sda5 ????/NTFS
[14:05] <Treeh416> odinsbane: Ok, one sec
[14:05] <devilash> odinsbane I think it's the firmware that I'm missing; it has to be.
[14:05] <barikulkol> hi
[14:05] <rian> Hi all, is there anywhere that explains how to set up audio input for ubuntu?
[14:05] <areels> can i use lxde instead gnome?
[14:06] <gorbierd> Anyone can help me with my touchpad problem?
[14:06] <scunizi> odinsbane, Treeh416 windows typically remains at the beginning of the drive (desktop)
[14:06] <xukun> anybody?
[14:06] <scunizi> sda1
[14:06] <barikulkol> ubuntu hardy heron is great
[14:06] <Treeh416> Guys, I'm not sure if this is significant, but whenI load up Ubuntu, for the first few seconds prior to the login screen everything is like a huge artifact on my screen
[14:06] <seriouslycgi> i updated to 8.04 server because of the ssh issues and now one of my disks wont work in ubuntu but they are ok in bios, how do i diagnose the disk?
[14:06] <barikulkol> but linux mint elyssa is better
[14:07] <scunizi> Treeh416, doesn't have anything to do with it.
[14:07] <Treeh416> ok
[14:07] <metalpres> is 8.04 better than gutsy?  i have been using gutsy for a long time with no problems and now everything is just breaking all over the place for no apparent reason, should i bother upgrading?
[14:07] <odinsbane> devilash that link I sent has pretty explicit instructions to getting the firmware.
[14:07] <zackyramone> can anyone help me set a web server?
[14:08] <scunizi> Treeh416, did you do what odinsbane asked?  fdisk -l ?
[14:08] <barikulkol> yes it is better than gutsy, the bugs in nvidia onboard audio is fixed
[14:08] <aniket> how to automount my ntfs partiions ????
[14:08] <Treeh416> yes
[14:08] <Treeh416> just now
[14:08] <Treeh416> It said
[14:08] <Treeh416> invalid option?
[14:08] <FloodBot3> Treeh416: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[14:08] <hypn0> metalpres: I'd wait for firefox 3 final to come out first
[14:08] <barikulkol> firefox beta 3 sucks
[14:09] <robg_> Treeh416: I suspect that Windows is no longer on your harddisk.
[14:09] <barikulkol> crashes on youtube frequently
[14:09] <Treeh416> robg_: Crap o.O
[14:09] <scunizi> Treeh416, the -l part is actually an "L" not a 1 (one) or an I (eye)
[14:09] <odinsbane> Treeh416 it is an L
[14:09] <odinsbane> type in sudo fdisk -l
[14:09] <Treeh416> Oh..
[14:09] <rian> <unconvertable> is there anywhere that explains how to set up audio input for ubuntu?
[14:09] <odinsbane> treeh416 I don't get any output unless I 'sudo fdisk -l'
[14:09] <robg_> Treeh416: before you install OSes you must first study the matter.
[14:10] <odinsbane> rian are you using a dell vostros?
[14:10] <Treeh416> ok it worked
[14:10] <Treeh416> robg_: I realize now XD
[14:10] <Treeh416> I have
[14:10] <Treeh416> sda1, sda2, and sda5
[14:10] <Treeh416> ....all linux
[14:10] <Treeh416> damn >.>
[14:10] <rian> <unconvertable> odinsbane: Sorry, I do not understand the question
[14:10] <devilash> odinsbane I still can't do it >.>
[14:10] <scunizi> Treeh416, That means you wiped out windows.
[14:10] <robg_> Treeh416: proceed from the assumption that you have only Ubuntu on your harddisk.
[14:11] <rian> I have an Acer and using 804
[14:11] <scunizi> odinsbane, I'm on a vostro.. with the audio prob..
[14:11] <[swb]> I have a question folks: The debian SSL random number generator problem.. does this affect ubuntu systems?
[14:11] <Treeh416> Ok.well...I'll re-install it
[14:11] <odinsbane> scunizi I recently got my mic working again.
[14:11] <AcornAcorn> How can I use the extra buttons on my keyboard?
[14:11] <Treeh416> Guys, can you help me with more thing?
[14:11] <wizo> can anyone advise me of where the checkbox for dimming is?
[14:11] <wizo> i cant find it under power management
[14:11] <Treeh416> I need to set up my wifi usb adapter in Linux...have NO idea how to go about doing this
[14:11] <scunizi> Treeh416, if you're adventurous., download VMWare server and install windows inside of that so you can run windows in a window in Ubuntu
[14:11] <rignes_> [swb]: Yup, I had to update and regenerate my ssl keys.
=== rignes_ is now known as rignes
[14:12] <Treeh416> scunizi: I was planning to do exactly this
[14:12] <[swb]> rignes, is there an easy procedure to do this?
[14:12] <odinsbane> rian There was a problem with the vostros internal mic.  Otherwise you should be able to set it up using alsa mixer.
[14:12] <[swb]> apt-get regenerate-all-my-broken-keys or something like that ;)
[14:12] <Treeh416> scunizi: Is VMWare better than Win4Lit ?
[14:12] <AcornAcorn> How can I use the extra buttons on my keyboard?
[14:13] <rian> <unconvertable> odinsbane: Thanks, did that, butvery little luck
[14:13] <Ace2016> press them
[14:13] <rignes> [swb]: I'm looking up the link right now
[14:13] <layo> hey,guys!
[14:13] <Ace2016> hey
[14:13] <Steve-cal> Can someone tell me what the advantage/disadvantage is of using UUID to specify my drives to mount on startup in my fstab file? Why not simply specify the device as /dev/hdaX or similar?
[14:13] <scunizi> Treeh416, I've never used Win4Lit, VMWare offers some usb support that some of the others don't.  I've used it for about 1.5 yrs now
[14:13] <rian> <unconvertable> odinsbane: It only works with the microphone jack, not the internal one
[14:13] <rignes> [swb]: http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2008/05/13/openssh-openssh-vulnerabilities-confirm-fix-instructions/
[14:13] <[swb]> Steve-cal, they may chanfge positions
[14:13] <AcornAcorn> Ace2016, I need to be able to set them up
[14:13] <Ace2016> oh
[14:13] <rignes> Sorry, probably should have tiny urled that.  But you get the idea. ;)
[14:13] <Treeh416> sunizi: Ok, great. Also, can you help me install a Siemens USB stick 108 WiFi adapter...I need an internet connection inside Ubuntu
=== [Xorothal] is now known as Xorothal
[14:13] <[swb]> Steve-cal, for example, if you change master to slae or change the cable they are on, the sdX will change, so all your mountpoints and grub and boot image would be all wrong
[14:14] <odinsbane> rian lemme look at the file I editted.
[14:14] <AcornAcorn> I should be able to change what the shortcut keys on my keyboard do right?
[14:14] <[swb]> but with UUID you can move them to your hearts content and it will always mount them in the right place
[14:14] <aniket> how to automount my ntfs partiions ????
[14:14] <rian> <unconvertable> odinsbane: Thanks
[14:14] <Treeh416> Sunizi: If worst comes to worst, I also have a robotics PCI wifi card I slot in...?
