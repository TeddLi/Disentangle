<s> <user> : hmm , well , i think running it natively would be better because it 's a somewhat old macbook , and it struggles sometimes . </s>
<s> <user> , these are all unoffical and as such not supported guides ; as seach term s i used your exact wording and the top out of eight were five from this year </s>
<s> <user> : i mean , it runs windows and os x well but not really optimal . i 've reformatted it a couple of times but it just is n't as fast anymore . </s>
<s> <user> : woah . i may seem lazy for not really looking at them , but i prefer to talk with a real person since i 'm new to linux and all of this . and i do n't wanna screw up anything :( </s>

<s> i 'm looking for information about installing ubuntu onto an existing machine alongside another distro and windows : URL/https:/ URL/gist.github.com/ <unk#a/> </s>

<s> or what do you think about virtual boxes ? win 10 runs fairly okay , but sometimes it does get slow . would running a vbox be affected by that ? </s>
<s> dang </s>
<s> depends why you want to run the ubuntu then do n't it ? </s>
<s> if you put it in a vbox , its just that . virtual . is that okay with you ? </s>
<s> i do n't think the performance will suffer much at all , unless you start running some kind of gpu heavy stuff </s>

<s> i 'll possibly start in a few hours , once i 've thought it through . </s>
<s> i find myself needing to run something in 256 colors . to that end , i wish to run another x server . would somebody please tell me what 's the best way to do that presently ? i 'm not seeing much about comparisons between xnest and xephyr , for example . </s>
<s> <user> : using wine ? </s>

<s> no , windows iso 's are not hybrid images </s>

<s> drone` is now known as <user> </s>
<s> can i get some help with setting up my bootable drives ? </s>
<s> i would say more but <user> has a point its not entirely related to #ubuntu tech support </s>
<s> #ubuntu-on-windows is usually dead </s>
<s> is anyone around that can help ? i ca n't login to my computer </s>
<s> <user> : how can we help you ? what is the issue ? </s>
<s> it 's in scrollback </s>
<s> <user> , bios or efi ? </s>
<s> i 'm not too sure . how can i check this ? i think efi though </s>
<s> when using lvm , should grub be installed to DIR/dev/ DIR/sda/ mbr or DIR/dev/ <unka#-/> ( the lv ) </s>
<s> <user> , sda , bios does n't understand lvm </s>
<s> and the issue is that when i login to ubuntu , it says that there are errors reading usb devices then it shows up in a terminal on a black screen . i think it 's recovery mode </s>
<s> <user> so you got past your grub menu yes ? </s>
<s> .... core.img unusually large , embedding failed , but <unka> is required for lvm </s>
<s> so now what ? </s>
<s> <user> yes . i did . but in my grub menu , i do n't see my windows boot disk which is a separate issue </s>
<s> <user> , did you forget to leave a 1mb space before your partitions ? </s>
<s> <user> _ is now known as <user> </s>
<s> hmm ok one thing at a time ( although they could be related ). what usb devices do you have plugged in ? </s>
<s> <user> : likely , since this is system used to just boot via lilo </s>
<s> and are you booting ubuntu from usb or directly off your main drive ? </s>
<s> the usual stuff . mouse , keyboard , bluetooth connector and a web cam . i have ubuntu installed on its own ssd </s>
<s> i can still use my keyboard when it 's in the terminal though </s>
<s> ok that is interesting ... </s>
<s> i was booting in successfully before </s>
<s> first thing i would try ( i suspect this is <unka/> issues with usb devices ) is to boot back into the grub menu and downgrade the kernel . select a previous kernel installed from the menu . </s>
<s> <user> , so , this is an existing install you are switching from lilo to grub ? </s>
<s> <user> : yeah try downgrading kernel first and lets see how it behaves :) </s>
<s> <user> : it 's an existing slackware install on lvm using lilo </s>
<s> ( lilo also boots windows of sdb ) </s>
<s> ( or did , it 's been blown <unka> by repeated attempts to get ubuntu going ) </s>
<s> ubuntu has two lvs of its own ( 50g <unk#a,/> DIR/boot/ ) </s>
<s> sda is one big pv with ( now ) <unk#a> </s>
<s> all in one <unka> </s>
<s> i was attempting to get windows to appear on grub and following some tutorials . i used os prober to find windows but that actually broke the windows partition . second , i used boot-repair and that stopped my ubuntu from allowing me to log in </s>
<s> <user> . how do i downgrade it ? i 'm in grub </s>
<s> ( and i want to preserve the slackware install ) </s>
<s> ok so in your grub menu is you use the down arrows do you see more kernel versions listed ? </s>
<s> like <unk#a-.> <unk#a-.> etc </s>
<s> i have " advanced options for ubuntu " , " <unk#a./> " , " <unk#a./> sdb1 " , and " system setup " </s>
<s> and of course " ubuntu " </s>
