[12:08] <jcz`> ok, i have to switch cables, so i'll rejoin the channel using my linux box after i swap ethernet cables, be right back
[12:08] <ompaul> jcz`, let me give you instructions first

[12:09] <jcz`> ok
[12:09] <dooglus> evad: I'm with you on this, yet people (like ompaul just did) continue to claim that sudo is a bad idea
[12:09] <thoreauputic> sudo can mess up ~/.ICEauthority on KDE, and .Xauthority
[12:09] <Fillado> Afief: Yes, that's the desktop one :)
[12:09] <khermans> dooglus, if there is a bad bug -- it could possibly hose your system
[12:09] <evad> oh
[12:09] <apokryphos> Afief: no, the setup has changed. There's an install+live CD (the desktop CD), and there's an old fashioned text install CD: the alternate CD
[12:09] <slackern> argh, so annoying that when you connect through places to a server that is down that it locks up almost everything till it times out.
[12:09] <dooglus> khermans: that's true of sudo and gksudo both

[12:37] <onkarshinde> ThE-LiGhT: That depend on what all packages you have already installed. May be your friend installed mroe packages form repos.
[12:37] <Spaceraver> ROBOd... use apt-get dist-upgrade or dl the cd...
[12:37] <apokryphos> ROBOd: it isn't; a proper upgrade from stable -> stable is fully supported
[12:38] <jcz`> ompaul, well, it says 'welcome to Ubuntu 6.06 LTS - Dapper Drake june 2006'
[12:38] <zjimbo> it's odd - I started downloading a while ago from releases.ubuntu.com and the speed hasn't dropped.
[12:38] <dooglus> thoreauputic: can you get him to miss out the "alternate is", like it did before?
[12:38] <ROBOd> Spaceraver: shall i download the livecd or the "normal" cd?
[12:38] <rixth> apokryphos, yeah, it kinda it for me anyway. All these updates have left orphaned files all over my filesystem, some functions such as auto-mounting of my camera don't work any more etc.
[12:38] <ROBOd> does the livecd allow me to upgrade?

[12:38] <thoreauputic> dooglus: I'll have another go
[12:38] <dooglus> ROBOd: the choice is desktop or alternate.  you want desktop
[12:38] <Roger_The_Bum> just the "desktop" cd
[12:38] <apokryphos> thoreauputic: that's soo altnerative oh my gosh
[12:38] <siccness> apokryphos, like what bugs?
[12:38] <onkarshinde> Roger_The_Bum: Yes there is. Only it has been renamed to Desktop CD
[12:39] <rixth> " The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer" does that mean 6.06 has a graphical installer?
[12:39] <Roger_The_Bum> and it has an installer
[12:39] <apokryphos> siccness: there aren't really many. Dapper is technically stable
[12:39] <Roger_The_Bum> rixth, yep
[12:39] <ROBOd> dooglus: so, i'll download desktop and it will nicely upgrade my stable ubuntu?

[12:56] <Sampizcat> I'm having trouble with 6.06 and setting up RAID - I've managed to configure the software raid (raid is disabled in BIOS) and it's formatted the partitions (by the looks of things), but now it's just gone to a blue screen, and noing else is happening
[12:56] <jcz`> not in the last day or two
[12:56] <negsoul> jcz`, to the new release today?
[12:56] <exhale> whats the difference between the dapper and the 6.06 torrents?
