[13:45] <alexxxa2> Is it really so? I am really considering reinstalling system, and this time I will choose 32 bit
[13:45] <alexxxa2> cause many programs wont install at all
[13:45] <bekks> alexxxa2: ^Name one :)
[13:45] <alexxxa2> they say 'dependance problem' or so
[13:45] <paulens> can someone tell me how to install grub?
[13:45] <MinIRC> alexxxa2: it is depend on your cpu architecture
[13:45] <xuser1> hi
[13:46] <bekks> alexxxa2: I am not aware of any program not being installable on 64bit for the last 10 years.
[13:46] <cfhowlett> !grub|paulens,
[13:46] <ubottu> paulens,: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
[13:46] <alexxxa2> bekks, skype won't install
[13:46] <bekks> alexxxa2: Thats not true :)
[13:46] <MinIRC> cfhowlett:  well, i'm having problem with EFI and grub it doesn't load
[13:46] <cfhowlett> alexxxa2, I've got skype on my 12.04 no problem
[13:46] <rymate1234> Lol Skype
[13:46] <bekks> !skype | alexxxa2
[13:46] <ubottu> alexxxa2: To install Skype on Ubuntu, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype - To record on Skype, check: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeRecordingHowto - Please use open protocols instead if you can, see !Ekiga
[13:46] <xuser1> how can i change resolution using xrandr?
[13:46] <paulens> cfhowlett: and why didn't it install grub together with ubuntu?
[13:46] <alexxxa2> firefox won't allow to be set to my language
[13:47] <bekks> alexxxa2: Then install the language pack you need to support your language.
[13:47] <cfhowlett> MinIRC, ah, well yes.  EFI is a tricky beast.  best you look in the mac resources
[13:47] <MinIRC> alexxxa2:  those are not problem to OS , more than the software you're using
[13:48] <cfhowlett> paulens, it should have.  do you have some weird set up?  multi HD's/SSD or such?
[13:48] <MinIRC> cfhowlett:  mum....i'm looking to resolve them
[13:48] <paulens> cfhowlett: no...
[13:48] <alexxxa2> Since I'm using xfce, I can install language only through Language assistence (or something like that) - and that's exactly what I 've done
[13:48] <alexxxa2> but firefox remains in english
[13:48] <alexxxa2> the thing is that I want to set this PC for my grandpa
[13:49] <alexxxa2> who doesn't speak english
[13:49] <alexxxa2> so this PC has to be in another lang
[13:49] <bekks> alexxxa2: You have to install the language pack for your firefox in your language, too.
[13:49] <paulens> cfhowlett: maybe i had to create a primary partition? all my ubuntu partitions are logical
[13:49] <bekks> alexxxa2: And thats nothing that will be different on 32bit.
[13:49] <MinIRC> alexxxa2:  can't agree more with bekks
[13:50] <alexxxa2> tried to google: where are language files stored in ubuntu - nothing
[13:50] <sebokie> what shall I do to boot into xbmc directly instead of Unity?
[13:50] <cfhowlett> paulens, no that wouldn't do it ... BUT ... are you dual booting ?
[13:50] <alexxxa2> bekks, any clues about how to install different language pack for any program? synaptic maybe?
[13:50] <bekks> alexxxa2: http://askubuntu.com/questions/93970/how-to-change-firefoxs-language
[13:50] <MinIRC> alexxxa2:  have you checked under the administration already ?
[13:51] <alexxxa2> minIRC yes
[13:51] <paulens> cfhowlett: yes? that's why i said that it boots windows...
[13:51] <cfhowlett> paulens, windows 8?
[13:51] <Darael> There's something broken with the Programmer Dvorak keyboard layout (once one logs in with it as the first layout, changing layouts ceases to be possible and the various extra options cease to work).  It's been that way for at least four releases.  No bug has been filed - which should I file it under?
[13:51] <MinIRC> alexxxa2:  i have set-up the whole ubuntu to french for my gf , and didn't have to use anything special than that's already in the system
[13:51] <paulens> cfhowlett: yes...
[13:52] <cfhowlett> paulens, then it might be a uefi thing ... out of my area of knowledge.
[13:52] <MinIRC> alexxxa2:  well there is a language of the system so change it from there, and then go and download firefox again and it will be downloaded with the os language you have choosen
[13:52] <paulens> cfhowlett: i don't have uefi, i have bios. win8 wasn't preinstalled

[13:53] <udhayaraj> can any one say how to download videos in  ubuntu

[13:54] <alexxxa2> I believe sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 is the solution to my 32bit problems
[13:54]  * MinIRC  is hugging alexxxa2  and telling her, everything have a solution don't worry
[13:54] <udhayaraj> is there s any alternative for mintube
[13:54] <udhayaraj> minitube8
[13:55] <bekks> alexxxa2: You shouldnt use that unless you know exactly what you are doing there.
[13:55] <udhayaraj> minitube*
[13:55] <paulens> eh... i just booted from that live usb again, and now it asks for password
[13:55] <Darael> udhayaraj: Well, minitube will quite happily *run* on Ubuntu - is there any reason th'art looking for something else?
[13:55] <MonkeyDust> udhayaraj  youtube-dl, then use winnff (gui) to convert
[13:56] <paulens> and i'm sure i hadn't set a password
[13:56] <alexxxa2> no hugging
[13:56] <MonkeyDust> winff*
[13:56] <adamk_> udhayaraj, Are you looking from the alternative that you aren't getting from minitube itself?
[13:56] <alexxxa2> bekks, why?
[13:56] <alexxxa2> wait for a moment
[13:56] <adamk_> udhayaraj, Err... What are you looking for....

[13:56] <alexxxa2> hey! Alexa is local nick name for Alexander. I'm male.
[13:56] <bekks> alexxxa2: Because it may break things.
[13:57] <alexxxxa2> bekks, what could it break?
[13:57] <alexxxxa2> do I have choice?
[13:58] <alexxxxa2> either that, or install 13.04 32bit
[13:58] <MinIRC> alexxxxa2:  what hardware you have ?
[13:58] <alexxxxa2> LAptop ASUS k52F
[13:58] <bekks> alexxxxa2: Just use 64bit and follow the instructions given, e.g. for skype.
[13:58] <bekks> alexxxxa2: And just dont use commands just thinking they might help unless verifying it.
[13:59] <alexxxxa2> in tutorial, it says: sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
[13:59] <alexxxxa2> Users of 64-bit Ubuntu, should enable MultiArch if it isn't already enabled by running the command
[13:59] <alexxxxa2> sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
[13:59] <Darael> alexxxxa2: MultiArch has been enabled by default for several releases now.
[13:59] <MinIRC> alexxxxa2:  it's an intel core i5 or i3... so use the i386 architecture for 64bit -) and be safe
[13:59] <mystiiq> how can I see successful ssh logins from the auth.log? does "cat auth.log | grep sshd | grep opened" list all logins?
=== yakko_zzz is now known as yakko
[13:59] <bekks> MinIRC: Thats nonsense, honestly.
[14:00] <alexxxxa2> is i386 same as 32bit?
[14:00] <alexxxxa2> guys, I got some error, cant install skype
[14:00] <bekks> alexxxxa2: Yes. And dont use it unless you dont have hardware not supporting 64bit.
[14:00] <bekks> !details | alexxxxa2
[14:00] <ubottu> alexxxxa2: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[14:00] <alexxxxa2> and the thing is that it's written in my language in terminal
[14:00] <alexxxxa2> moment, just to set the system back to english
[14:01] <alexxxxa2> so I can copy paste error here
[14:02] <MinIRC> bekks: i don't see why it is nonsense -) changing 32 or 64 bit is pretty much the same...it's all depend what you're using as a cpu..
[14:02] <debiantoruser> Greetings, where i can get support about poclbm(ubuntu 13.04/amd-app-sdk 3.8) ?
[14:02] <bekks> MinIRC: Yeah, and using 32bit on 64bit hw is just a pointless waste of resources.
[14:02] <alexxxxa2> i'll paste soon the error
[14:03] <bekks> alexxxxa2: Use a pastebin service then, please.
[14:03] <alexxxxa2> ofcourse
[14:04] <alexxxxa2> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5635484/
[14:04] <alexxxxa2> and btw, how do I remove join and quit messages in xchat?
[14:04] <OerHeks>  debiantoruser just ask,  someone who knows the answer will likely reply
[14:04] <alexxxxa2> it bothers me
[14:05] <Darael> ...am I experiencing a bug, or is the dark border around the window decoration on unmaximised windows a new "feature"?
[14:06] <MinIRC> bekks: what waste of resources? i have tested the both on the same laptop and did see any difference, soon they will change it to 128bit architecture cause the transistors will be written to 14nm and then..what? it all depends on the software if it is optimised or not..for the architecture..so using the 64bit is not such a big of a deal for intel i-x architecture
[14:06] <mizifih> lets say I put "su marcio -c znc" inside rc.local, does it make znc start as if user marcio did it?
[14:07] <bekks> MinIRC: In fact, you are totally wrong, and it is offtopic in here.
[14:07] <bekks> alexxxxa2: Whats the output of dpkg -l | grep skype

[14:09] <alexxxxa2> 'dpkg -l | grep skype' <------ nothing here :(
[14:09] <alexxxxa2> I did
[14:10] <jrib> mizifih: I'd suggest just use crontab, that's what znc docs recommend as well.  Ideally you'd setup an upstart script

[14:17] <bekks> wushu: And 11.04 isnt supported anymore - you're stuck.
[14:17] <MinIRC> ubuntu293:  do you have set-up the wifi manager ? or it wasn't installed when you boot up the os?

[14:18] <mizifih> jrib: gnome-schedule, even better!
[14:18] <wushu> bekks: but thanks for the help anyways
[14:18] <cloneG> hello dakotawulfy are you there?
[14:19] <dakotawulfy> yes
[14:19] <ubuntu293> MinIRC: wifi manager wasn't installed
[14:19] <ubuntu293> i think
[14:19] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: I uninstalled all nvidia and the graphic environment came back to the latest kernel in low mod though
[14:20] <dakotawulfy> now u need to install the new driver with jocky-gtk
[14:20] <MinIRC> ubuntu293:  so do this :  sudo apt-get install network-manager
[14:20] <dakotawulfy> cloneG in the new kernel
[14:21] <harris> Dr_willis, my computer keeps poping from the sound chip turning on and off
[14:21] <dakotawulfy> cloneG and u did that in the old one too right
[14:21] <MinIRC> ubuntu293:  and then this : sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome for the applet and you're ready go to
[14:21] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: and running jockey-gtk I get NVIDIA binary Xorg driver, kernel modul and VDPAU library....
[14:21] <paulens> do i need to select a separate partition for grub, or can i install it in /?
[14:21] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: but I dont know wich one to install
[14:21] <afidegnum> hello good morning all, where is the ubuntu studio channel?
[14:22] <dakotawulfy> ok hold on
[14:22] <harris> please Dr_willis
[14:22] <MinIRC> ubuntu293:  good luck with that..
[14:22] <afidegnum> I have ubuntu desktop installed and I want to change the desktop layout to UbuntuStudios''s desktoop layout
[14:22] <ubuntu293> MinIRC: My mistake. It seems that it was already installed. I think that the os doesn't recognize my Wifi card and when I want to install drivers, it doesn't work
[14:22] <mizifih> is software central (13.04 with latest) really bugged or is it just me?
[14:23] <mizifih> Everytime I use it it hangs the gauge at 50% but stuff are actually installed
[14:23] <alexxxxa2> bekks: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5635551/
[14:23] <BluesKaj>  paulens / is good
[14:23] <mizifih> it happened like 40% of the time I used it
[14:23] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: the point is I read in many threads the way to install the latest nvidia driver was to install nvidia-current-updates after getting swat-x updates ppa ...
[14:23] <dakotawulfy> cloneG ok pick the nvidia graphics driver  version current recommended
[14:23] <bekks> alexxxxa2: Thats not the full output I asked for.
[14:24] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: but it is not staying in the jockey-gtk!!!!
[14:24] <BluesKaj> swat-x isn't relaible IME , i'd stay away from thast ppa ., cloneG
[14:24] <MinIRC> ubuntu293: hmmm if you're trying to install drivers written for windows, it won't work for sure... and if your wifi card is recent model may be there are none written for linux yet...so
[14:24] <dakotawulfy> cloneGi use the tools it has less chance of messing up stuff
[14:25] <MinIRC> ubuntu293: on what machine you're dealing with that problem?
[14:25] <harris> my computer keeps poping from the sound chip turning on and off how can i turn off the powersaving
[14:25] <dakotawulfy> see if u have nvidia common installed in synaptic
[14:25] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: only three nvidia options in the jockey gtk= nvidia binary xorg driver kernel module and vdpau library an experimental one and nvidia riva/tnt/geforce...
[14:25] <paulens> ok so i have /dev/sda6 swap, /dev/sda8 "/" and /dev/sda7 "/home"
[14:25] <Rallias> Is there a way to set up a br0 device within an LXC container?
[14:25] <matti_> leave
[14:26] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: I tried the nvidia riva and it hanged the computer
[14:26] <ubuntu293> MinIRC: Compaq Presario CQ57. I found some procedure on web but no one solves my problem
[14:26] <paulens> and "Device for boot loader installation" set to /dev/sda8
[14:26] <alexxxxa2> bekks: I'm sorry. This is whole output http://paste.ubuntu.com/5635557/
[14:26] <dakotawulfy> cloneG u should have like 7 to chose from  in jocky-gtk
[14:26] <cloneG> dakotawulfy:but they are all the same!!
[14:27] <dakotawulfy> u did not use jocky-gtk to install that one ???
[14:27] <harris> my computer keeps poping from the sound chip turning on and off how can i turn off the powersaving
[14:27] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: vdpau library
[14:27] <alexxxxa2> what about this: or if you are using the unstable
[14:27] <alexxxxa2> distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
[14:27] <alexxxxa2> or been moved out of Incoming.
[14:28] <MinIRC> ubuntu293:  did you already checked that page : http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/rt2800pci ?
[14:29] <mizifih> brb
[14:30] <dakotawulfy> cloneG take look at this  http://ompldr.org/vaWJtaw/2013-05-05_650x588--1367764049.jpg
[14:30] <paulens> BluesKaj: i selected my language, clicked "something else", then configured this: partition / - 20GB, ext4, format; swap - 4GB; partition /home - 80GB, ext4, format; device for bootloader install - /dev/sda8 (same as /)
[14:31] <paulens> do i need to select something else?
[14:31] <paulens> because when i did this before, it didn't install grub...
[14:33] <dakotawulfy> paulens not for sure u might have to make the / portion  with a boot flag
[14:33] <paulens> dakotawulfy: ohhh..... but then don't i need another partition for /?
[14:33] <dakotawulfy> paulens and u have to select that in the install  make sure u have it right
[14:34] <dakotawulfy> not real sure any help is that right
[14:34] <BluesKaj> paulens, unless you already have grub installed somewhere on the drive

[14:37] <paulens> that's what i selected
[14:37] <paulens> is it alright?
[14:37] <dakotawulfy> cloneG  that is the open source one
[14:37] <dakotawulfy> do u want the one nvidia uses
[14:39] <paulens> can someone have a look at my screenshot and tell me if i did something wrong?.. sorry for being noob :$
[14:40] <dakotawulfy> paulens
[14:40] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: and why am I not seeing the recommended one?
[14:40] <paulens> dakotawulfy: ?
[14:40] <adamk_> paulens, I'm not seeing a partition for / , though perhaps you have to scroll down.
[14:40] <paulens> eh
[14:40] <paulens> someone just said that i need /boot instead of /...
[14:40] <paulens> lol
[14:40] <betrayd> imo /boot is too big, won't really grow that much
[14:40] <dakotawulfy> paulens /boot  needs to be / maybe with boot flag
[14:41] <betrayd> better^
[14:41] <paulens> dakotawulfy: how do i do that?
[14:41] <fellayaboy> what should i do when "make" doesnt compile correctly and i just want to delete all the stuff it created and did
[14:41] <paulens> dakotawulfy: how do i set the flag?
[14:41] <adamk_> Personally, I keep /boot as a separate partition.
[14:41] <adamk_> But, as betrayd said, 20 gigs is way too big.
[14:42] <paulens> ok, i set /boot to 10 gigs
[14:42] <dakotawulfy> adamk_ yea but then he needs another portion   / and the /boot
[14:42] <betrayd> fellayaboy: it may not have moved stuff around, the created ones are still in the source dir
[14:42]  * you_ have performed an  illegal action. Please restart your computer
[14:42] <adamk_> dakotawulfy, Right....  And?
[14:42] <paulens> dakotawulfy: so are we talking about 4 partitions now?
[14:42] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: might it be because I have no nvidia packages installed?
[14:42] <dakotawulfy> heheh going up
[14:42] <fellayaboy> the source directory? ok so im a lil new with make..how does it do its thing? it first stores its stuff in /usr/src?
[14:43] <dakotawulfy> cloneG
[14:43] <betrayd> paulens is that the enire layout in the shot or a pageUp is needed?
[14:43] <NickNackGus> pualens: What was your original problem again? No GRUB?
[14:43] <dakotawulfy>  cloneG ok check if u have nvidia common installed in synaptic
[14:43] <betrayd> fellayaboy: yes, normally at the end at 'make install' it'll start moving stuff to their places
[14:44] <paulens> betrayd: you see everything in the screenshot. scrolling down only reveals the external usb drive
[14:44] <betrayd> paulens: ok
[14:44] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: no, i run: sudo remove --purge nvidia* and thats why I can see desktop with latest kernel now
[14:44] <afidegnum> hi, how do I see the current version of ubuntu running?
[14:44] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: so nvidia-common is certainly not in the system
[14:45] <paulens> betrayd: is it good? i added 10 gigs / now, and reduced /boot to 10 gigs
[14:45] <afidegnum> I mean the current version version of ubuntu installed on my system
[14:45] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: is it needed?
[14:45] <betrayd> paulens: another shot would be nice though
[14:45] <paulens> ok, uploading...
[14:45] <betrayd> paulens: the modified one
[14:45] <dakotawulfy> cloneG well go see if u can install it
[14:45] <dakotawulfy> in syanptic
[14:45] <paulens> betrayd: yeah, i understand..
[14:45] <adamk_> paulens, /boot really doesn't need to be more than a gig or two.
[14:45] <betrayd> paulens: ^
[14:45] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: lol oh I asure you I can
[14:45] <fellayaboy> oh ok awesome.... hey im trying to compile something thats needs automake 1.3* ... i have ubuntu 12.04 do i have to upgrade to 12.10 or 13.04 to get automake 1.3*

[14:46] <MonkeyDust> afidegnum  or cat /etc/issue
[14:46] <betrayd> fellayaboy: nah not too sure, why do you need to 'make' stuff? If you want to be a dev, i'd contact ubuntu devs
[14:46] <paulens> yeah, i'm not saving space, i have 1TB, and this install is for testing...
=== you_ is now known as yofun
[14:47] <fellayaboy> i want to use dnscrypt which is from opendns
[14:47] <fellayaboy> they dont have a .deb or something easier
[14:47] <alexxxxa2> bekks, any further hint?
[14:47] <dakotawulfy>  paulens have a question  what window s u have ???
[14:47] <betrayd> fellayaboy: what do they have, rpm?
[14:48] <betrayd> or just a tar gz/tar xz?
[14:48] <paulens> dakotawulfy: win8.1
[14:48] <BluesKaj> odd that you would want a boot partition , don't see the point of it dakotawulfy , paulens
[14:48] <fellayaboy> i think i seen fpm...gentoo.. but i havent seen deb, debian, or ubuntu builds
[14:48] <dakotawulfy> ask any one does windows 8 let u duel boot ??
[14:49] <paulens> dakotawulfy: yes, i'm dual-booting with windows 7
[14:49] <paulens> i was*
[14:49] <cemycc> ubuntu 13.04 have software raid installtion support ?
[14:49] <fellayaboy> http://dnscrypt.org/
[14:49] <dakotawulfy> I thought they were going to make it were u could not boot other os ??
[14:49] <betrayd> fellayaboy: maybe easier to convert rpm to deb using alien
[14:49] <NickNackGus> if you're having trouble installing a Windows /Ubuntu dual boot, try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[14:50] <BluesKaj> paulens, is windows 7 the first partition , if so then that's where grub installed , on the mbr
[14:50] <fellayaboy> yeah thats true if i find it..well ima figure this out if not ill use dnscrypt 1.21
[14:50] <paulens> BluesKaj: i'm no longer using windows 7, i deleted it
[14:50] <fellayaboy> thanks for the clarification guys
[14:50] <betrayd> fellayaboy: or ubuntu's supplied thingi
[14:50] <BluesKaj> paulens ok
[14:50] <paulens> BluesKaj: should i install grub on top of windows boot loader?
[14:51] <fellayaboy> yup betrayd

[14:52] <cemycc> someone can tell me if ubuntu 13.04 have support for software raids like the old alternative cds ?
[14:52] <betrayd> paulens: and its not really 'on top of' they'
[14:53] <dakotawulfy> cloneG: u are on the new kernel right and uninstalled the other on the old kernel right
[14:53] <betrayd>  would coexist paulens
[14:53] <paulens> BluesKaj: so what should i select as "device for boot loader installation"?
[14:53] <paulens> betrayd: yeah but i meant the same partition
[14:53] <betrayd> ok bbiab
[14:53] <BluesKaj> paulens, / , whatever /dev/sdX it is
[14:53] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: I uninstalled all nvidia packages in the new kernel thats all I did
[14:53] <paulens> NickNackGus: i'm not using uefi
[14:54] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: and then reinstalled nvidia-common
[14:54] <paulens> BluesKaj: ok, thanks, gonna try installing now...
[14:54] <paulens> without /boot
[14:54] <dakotawulfy> cloneG: did u remove the driver in the old kernel ???
[14:54] <paulens> just swap, / and /home
[14:54] <dakotawulfy> with jocky-gtk
[14:54] <BluesKaj>  /boot isn't needed , paulens
[14:54] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: no
[14:55] <paulens> BluesKaj: yeah i removed it
[14:55] <BluesKaj> ok , you're good to go paulens
[14:55] <notOnIRC_> Has quantal reached EOL?
[14:56] <alexxxxa2> bekks, Im downloading 32bit XUbuntu
[14:56] <away> notOnIRC_, no
[14:56] <alexxxxa2> I'll install it
[14:56] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: do I need to remove drivers from all kernels?
[14:56] <dakotawulfy> cloneG: ok  now this is what i did i wen to old kernel used jocky-gtk  remove driver then boot back in to should not have nivida driver loaded  then go to the new  kernel and add the one i showed u  in screen shot
[14:56] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: not drivers but packages
[14:56] <bekks> alexxxxa2: Basically nothing will change, since the problems named will occur again.
[14:56] <Vyom> Hi guys. Hope everyone's ok. I have a simple query to ask. I am upgrading to 13.04 from within 12.10. I have reached till here: http://img.krow.me/di/O5Q8/Screenshot_from_2013-05-05_20:08:17.png My PC is slow, and it will take hours to decompress those packages. So I was wondering if I can quit now, and later the setup can resume from where I left? Pls answer.
[14:57] <notOnIRC_> Until when is it supported? I hope no one minds me asking here instead of googling. My connection is having some problems and IRC is easier for it.
[14:57] <alexxxxa2> bekks, I bet it will work
[14:57] <bekks> Vyom: You should not interrupt the update.
[14:57] <alexxxxa2> time will show
[14:57] <bekks> alexxxxa2: I wont bet on that :P
[14:57] <dakotawulfy> cloneG: not sure why but it works  has to be done that way and it should work
[14:57] <alexxxxa2> or, Ill install 12.10 (32bit)
[14:57] <alexxxxa2> one after another
[14:58] <josePHPagoda> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2139480&page=2 I'm impacted by that same issue.  Does anyone know if there's been a deb file released to fix that (doesn't need to be in the official repos)  It's kind of an annoying regression
[14:58] <alexxxxa2> I dont care if its 32 or 64 bit. Its for my grandpa, after all
[14:58] <bekks> alexxxxa2: Why dont you use 12.04, which will be supported till 2017?
[14:58] <dakotawulfy> cloneG: then your old kernel will not work with the nvidia driver but new on will
[14:58] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: okay...though I think there is no active nvidia driver right now
[14:58] <alexxxxa2> Ok. If 13.04 32bit wont work either, Ill install 12.04 then
[14:59] <bekks> alexxxxa2: 13.04 will be supported for 9 months only - January 2014
[14:59] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: you meant deactivating the driver didnt you?
[14:59] <dakotawulfy> cloneG: right  go to old kernel remove it
[14:59] <Vyom> bekks: But I think packages are downloaded, and the setup can simply resume from where I left?
[14:59] <sideeffect> typical scientific fonts in papers are?
[15:00] <bekks> Vyom: Will will have an undefined state between two releases. You should not interrupt the update.
[15:00] <dakotawulfy> well in jocky gtk it says remove button
[15:00] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: but the point is that the recommended driver is not stayed anyway
[15:00] <dakotawulfy> cloneG: are u in the old one now???
[15:01] <paulens> ok, it said installation complete, continue testing/restart
[15:01] <dakotawulfy> cloneG: the old kernel
[15:01] <Vyom> bekks: That sounds scary. Ok, thanks for the reply. I will try to consider the time in future upgrades.
[15:01] <paulens> i clicked restart and......
[15:01] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: latest kernel
[15:01] <cemycc> someone here can tell me if the ubuntu 13.04 have some software raid support at instalation ?
[15:01] <dakotawulfy> cloneG: go to the old kernel
[15:01] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: 3.5.0-18
[15:01] <paulens> it boots windows.
[15:02] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: yes you told me to deactivate driver there...with jockey-gtk

[15:02] <josePHPagoda> i'm not sure if you have to use the alternative installer still or not though
[15:02] <dakotawulfy> cloneG: and u are using the  the next version kernel
[15:03] <dakotawulfy> for 12.10
[15:03] <dakotawulfy>  kernel
[15:03] <paulens> i don't know what to do anymore :(
[15:03] <paulens> it just doesn't detect grub...
[15:03] <dakotawulfy> cloneG:  let me ask did u no that???
[15:03] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: the kernel updates automatic
[15:03] <cemycc> josePHPagoda, from what i have seen there are not alternative cd for 13.04 :) if I can create raid partition and raid array on the install then I dont need it

[15:05] <Pinkamena_D> Hello, I hav been getting a problem (for example right now) where my bluetooth mouse will connect but the pointer will no move
[15:06] <josePHPagoda> cemycc: if you tell it that you want to install using your own approach, that'd be where it is
[15:06] <josePHPagoda> I've not looked though
[15:06] <Pinkamena_D> I can tell its wrking because the bluetooth is built in and the bluetooth light on the laptop blinks when I move the mouse
[15:06] <josePHPagoda> so you'll need to go through the install process up to that point
[15:06] <dakotawulfy>  cloneG Let me go see what we have to do
[15:06] <Pinkamena_D> but again, the pointer does not move, any ideas?
[15:06] <BluesKaj> Pinkamena_D, make sure you battery switch is turned on'
[15:07] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: okay go asking elysium
[15:07] <dakotawulfy> ok check in syanptic  for this  linux-generic-lts-quantal

[15:08] <paulens> betrayd: i'm not "she". i'm male.
[15:09] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: not installed
[15:09] <betrayd> lol my bad paulens
[15:09] <dakotawulfy> u should have this kernel linux-headers-3.2.0-40
[15:10] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: the one installed: linux-headers-3.5.0-18 the one with the kernel version
[15:10] <dakotawulfy> or 41
[15:10] <dakotawulfy> that for the new 13.04 kernel
[15:10] <paulens> BluesKaj: betrayd: so what have i done wrong?
[15:10] <BluesKaj> paulens, then grub is probly already installed , hold the left shift key down right after the BIOS screen when booting
[15:10] <dakotawulfy> cloneG well hold on
[15:11] <paulens> BluesKaj: eh... can i hold it BEFORE bios screen? with win8, the bios screen appears only for a part of second... i can't press it so quickly xD
[15:12] <BluesKaj> yes
[15:12] <BluesKaj> paulens, ^
[15:12] <dakotawulfy> cloneG ok this is what my kernel is linux-headers-3.2.0-41
[15:12] <paulens> BluesKaj: didn't work...
[15:12] <bekks> dakotawulfy: Thats not a kernel, those are headers.
[15:13] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: and you might be using linux-headers matching that kernel version right?
[15:13] <dakotawulfy> if driver not working on the kernel u have try a different  one  might not work on that one
[15:13] <paulens> BluesKaj: i kept holding it starting with the sound signal until windows logo appeared
[15:13] <Pinkamena_D> blueman shows it as connected and working
[15:13] <dakotawulfy> righ
[15:13] <bekks> cloneG: Thats how they are intended to be used, yes.
[15:13] <dakotawulfy> but still right
[15:13] <Pinkamena_D> somehow the movement is not getting through though
[15:14] <BluesKaj> paulens, ok let me get this straight , did this machine come with W8 installed when you bought it by any chance ?
[15:14] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: well as the latest is not working I ll try downgrading both...

[15:17] <orated> Hi! I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 and recently noticing that my system's 25GB separate root partition is getting quickly occupied by usr and var. I'm not able to understand how var is taking up 11.3GiB and usr as 10.4GiB. When I'm trying to upgrade to 13.04, not enough space is left for download to complete and proceed to package installation. How can I solve this problem?
[15:17] <paulens> BluesKaj: i think it is installed, but there's no record in my BCD
[15:17] <dakotawulfy> cloneG don't think that right for the 12.04
[15:18] <paulens> BluesKaj: it automatically boots the first partition it finds, which is windows boot loader
[15:18] <BluesKaj> windows ignores linux , paulens
[15:18] <dakotawulfy> cloneG i might be

[15:52] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: hello
[15:52] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: I dont see older headers on synaptic
[15:54] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: how would I install 3.2.0-40 headers and make that kernel the default one?

[15:54] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: I did nothing
[15:54] <w4rl0ckx> Any one needing any help

[16:02] <afidegnum> hi all, I get it back
[16:03] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: look there is something I dont understand....that is why in the world synaptic is displaying packages for other ubuntu versions but the one I am using?

[16:04] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: how do I get the headers for the kernel precise needs?
[16:04] <Supercomp> <DJones>It seems the device is not supported with Ubuntu

[16:06] <DJones> Supercomp: Are you using 13.04?
[16:06] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: this is annoying!
[16:07] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: I was happy with ubuntu 12.04 since a couple of weeks ago...
[16:07] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: when the kernel upgraded
[16:08] <Supercomp> <DJones> No it is 11.04
[16:08] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: but would you tell me how to get the packages I need?
[16:08] <Supercomp> <DJones> I checked in 12.04 also, it didn't work
[16:09] <johnjohn1011> cloneG: what kernel are you trying to get for what version?
[16:09] <DJones> Supercomp: Thats the problem, the drivers for mtp were significantly improved for 13.04, I've not had much sucess with anything prior to that

[16:09] <orated> Hi! I found that syslog and kern.log in /var/log is taking up 5GiB each. I was wondering why my system's /var and /usr are consuming ~10GiB each. Is it fine if I delete syslog and kern.log from /var/log ?
[16:09] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: for linuxheaders 3.2.0-40 I found this: http://pkgs.org/ubuntu-12.04/ubuntu-updates-main-i386/linux-headers-3.2.0-40-generic_3.2.0-40.64_i386.deb.html
[16:09] <Supercomp> <DJones> You mean to say it should work in 13.04
[16:09] <DJones> Supercomp: I'd suggest downloading a 13.04 iso and just try a live USB version to see if it detects it
[16:09] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: should I download and install that?
[16:10] <BluesKaj> cloneG, you've mucked up your graphics driver with x-swat ppa  , stay away from it ans consult with us before yopu add one the next time
[16:10] <Supercomp> <DJones> Will do it. Thanks
[16:10] <DJones> Supercomp: Good luck
[16:10] <orated> *on desktop installation
[16:10] <dakotawulfy> cloneG if the old one works you should be fine   you need to use jocky-gtk install the driver should work
[16:10] <cloneG> BluesKaj: I was warned
[16:11] <dakotawulfy> cloneG but not going to fix the other problem
[16:12] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: no trusty ppa for nvidia drivers?
[16:12] <dakotawulfy> cloneG by putting in the nvidia common u got what u need in there
[16:13] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: I get it...
[16:13] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: how could I get back to default?
[16:14] <BluesKaj> cloneG, you don't need a ppa , the avialable drivers should work , but your nvidia-xconfig probly needs updating in order for thedriver to load properly
[16:14] <dakotawulfy> cloneG use the one i showed you with the screen shot
[16:14] <cloneG> dakotawulfy: I mean the synaptic packages are all messed up because none matches the ubuntu version I am using

[16:24] <paulens> it says BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 000000000p00043c
[16:24] <paulens> MonkeyDust: my question is in the screenshot
[16:24] <BluesKaj> cloneG, yeah , for now and the nouveau driver will run , but I haven't seen this with other 8800gt users

[16:25] <MonkeyDust> paulens  don't be lazy and just type the question
[16:26] <paulens> WHY AM I GETTING THIS?
[16:26] <paulens> typed twice before
[16:26] <ichat_> donte be rude man
[16:26] <cloneG> BluesKaj: I would like to get this solved...
[16:26] <ichat_> cloneG,  did you seach the nvidia user forums?
[16:27] <paulens> MonkeyDust: just installed ubuntu 13, trying to boot, and i get this output after grub
[16:28] <cloneG> BluesKaj: dakotaWulfy has been helping me trying to synch kernel version with linux-headers pointing that might be the problem and once synchronized using jockey-gtk to install recommended driver
[16:28] <MusMuHe> hi all
[16:29] <spice4life> so, what are you guys up to?
[16:29] <cloneG> ichat_ they quickly tell you its a linux issue
[16:29] <thurstylark> My computer is warning me about the update broken count is >0. What do I need to do to fix this?
[16:29] <BluesKaj> cloneG, well, he might be right , are you on 12.04 ?
[16:29] <adamk_> paulens, You hit a kernel panic.  Could be caused by any number of things.
[16:30] <cloneG> BluesKaj: ubuntu 12.04 64 bit
[16:30] <paulens> adamk_: eh... how do i fix it? i mean how do i troubleshoot it?
[16:30] <adamk_> paulens, Try booting with acpi and/or lapic disabled.  Try a different kernel.  Run memtest on your computer.
[16:30] <cloneG> BluesKaj: and the kernel and headers are synch to 3.5.0
[16:30] <adamk_> paulens, File a bug report :-)
[16:31] <jair> guys is there such a thing like an installer for ubuntu besides the live version? I think before was called optional or additional? something like that?
[16:31] <cloneG> BluesKaj but not working 3d acceleration

[16:31] <jair> thurstylark: perfect that is what I am looking for!
[16:31] <thurstylark> jair: It's all text based, and it works really well :)
[16:32] <jair> thurstylark: yes, exactly is there one available for the latest version of ubuntu?
[16:32] <ichat_> paulens,  remove  --quiet --spash (or somthing) from your boot option
[16:32] <thurstylark> jair: no problem! It's in a specific section, let me find it...
[16:32] <BluesKaj> cloneG, i recall having problems with nvidia on 12.04 , but it wasn't kernel module failure , it was a crappy driver so  iused nouveau for w=quite a while til the nvidia driver issue was fixed
[16:33] <k2> i connect using PPPoE connection
[16:33] <thurstylark> jair: here you go: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads

[16:33] <paulens> maybe recovery mode?
[16:34] <k2>  i connect using PPPoE connection    i cant disconnect
[16:34] <paulens> ichat_: maybe recovery mode?
[16:34] <k2> poff command fils
[16:34] <cloneG> BluesKaj: would you downgrade kernel? I think that is not the way to go... but I dont really know what to think when the 13.04 is not lts nevermore
[16:34] <k2> poff command fails
[16:34] <BluesKaj> cloneG, the upgrade to 12.10 fixed my problem btw

[16:42] <ichat_> paulens,  when you hit E   than  move your cursor to  quiete splash and remove (only) those 2 words
[16:42] <ichat_> than you will see all textual output

[16:54] <MonkeyDust> !notunity | wins start here
[16:54] <ubottu> wins start here: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use the !Unity desktop environment by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown.

[17:02] <boxes> anyone able to help with vlc or ps3mediaserver
[17:03] <frank_> hi there, any one know if a Medion USB DVB-T dongle is supported by Ubuntu 13.04 ?
[17:03] <bekks> frank_: It depends on the chipset used.
[17:03] <donvito|2> how to reach via the internet, folders like portal, and forum ? i have dyndns my ip but i cant reach anything on /var/www folder
[17:05] <frank_> hi bekks it should be based on a realtek chip
[17:06] <bekks> frank_: Never heard of DVB-T dongles with a Realtek chipset.
[17:06] <donvito|2> ls - CCcamInfoPHP  index.html  phpsysinfo  portal
[17:06] <donvito|2> this is how my /var/www/ looks
[17:07] <betrayd> donvito|2: doesny dyndns require you to run a script to link your current external IP to your box
[17:08] <donvito|2> betrayd let me check
[17:08] <betrayd> ah
[17:08] <delac> can anyone explain to me why "aticonfig --od-getcloks" shows "GPU load" as zero on gameplay? The load does sometimes show few percentage on normal desktop use, but only zero when playing games.
[17:08] <moppers> frank_, PCI one is ... i know yo have usb, maybe that site also knows ... http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-T_PCI_Cards
[17:08] <donvito|2> ok how to reach the www folder with my ip?
[17:09] <donvito|2> example http://ip.ip:80/portal
[17:09] <bekks> donvito|2: You have to create a portforwarding on your router.
[17:09] <donvito|2> i did that
[17:09] <moppers> it should work then
[17:09] <betrayd> donvito|2: sure there's not a newer external IP
[17:09] <betrayd> ?
[17:09] <frank_> hi bekks it is this one, i really dont know what chip it uses but the name on the dongle is: Medion 	Mini DVB-T USB Stick 	MD 86351
[17:09] <donvito|2> im sure
[17:09] <bekks> donvito|2: And being behind a router, most likely it isnt capable of dealing with loopback NAT, so you have to test that from outside.
[17:10] <bekks> frank_: The name is pretty irrelevant, the chipset is the important information.
[17:10] <CarlFK> how do I find what package supplies apt-add-repository ?
[17:10] <donvito|2> should i open port 80 on router?
[17:10] <moppers> donvito|2, i jsut got here, have you made sure the server is up?
[17:10] <bekks> donvito|2: Of course, if you want to access it from outside.
[17:10] <donvito|2> moppers yes i cant acces from localhost
[17:10] <moppers> donvito|2, that;s dependent on the router... some will do that as part of port forward automaticlaly
[17:10] <moppers> cant?
[17:11] <donvito|2> TCP or UDP?
[17:11] <frank_> okay i will try to find out
[17:11] <moppers> wait
[17:11] <bekks> donvito|2: Does http://localhost:80/portal work?
[17:11] <moppers> if oyu are accessing the server from localhost, why are you going through the router?
[17:11] <moppers> of course that wont work!
[17:11] <donvito|2> its fine now
[17:11] <donvito|2> http://nertiltvbox.no-ip.org/portal/
[17:11] <donvito|2> can anyone check does it work?
[17:12] <moppers> i guess i missed the start of the question, as it makes no sense. i'll be quiet now.
[17:12] <rtnb> i'm ssh'ing into a remote machine and just today it started telling me that /etc/sudoers cant be found and I can't run sudo operations on it
[17:12] <betrayd> i seea forum, donvito|2

[17:12] <donvito|2> it works
[17:12] <rtnb> I tried apt-get install sudo but apt-get command isnt found

[17:14] <rtnb> at the end of what?
[17:14] <o3u> johnjohn1011: Thanks!
[17:14] <betrayd> rtnb: seems like you wanted to install sudo
[17:14] <moppers> betrayd, he's trying to reinstall sudo it looks like. and it looks like the machine is broke, as apt-get isnt installed

[17:17] <rtnb> i cant
[17:17] <rtnb> this is just the box on my hosting
[17:17] <betrayd> rtnb: is why sudo runs it, sudo may have the correct path

[18:18] <wilee-nilee> shankstaBytes, This is not ubuntu complaints but support.
[18:18] <Walex2> nownot: what can do is to schedule a script every minute, and then the scripts does 11 repetitions every 5 seconds.
[18:18] <Walex2> nownot: in that way you get the automatic running of CRON and the every-5-seconds that you want.

[18:18] <nownot> gotcha coach, thanks!

[18:47] <XHEART24> i have a sony media player but it does not read mp4
[18:47] <XHEART24> i want to transfer the video to a usb stick and see it on my media player, i do not have plasma yet
[18:48] <mizifih> avidemux
[18:48] <XHEART24> i only have ubuntu 12.04
[18:48] <mizifih> XHEART24: avidemux?
[18:48] <frosty> i think i've found a wierd bug :-), if i double click on a simple dropdown like the one in the example on http://w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_select my screen turns black until i release, anyone else tried?
[18:50] <Dr_willis> Hmm. weird media player that dosent support mp4
[18:50] <XHEART24> i only have to download it? avidemux?
[18:50] <Dr_willis> avidemux is in the repos yes.
[18:50] <Dr_willis> !info avidemux
[18:50] <ubottu> avidemux (source: avidemux): a free video editor - GTK version. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1:2.5.4-0ubuntu13 (raring), package size 764 kB, installed size 1957 kB
[18:50] <XHEART24> it is a sony media player it is not new
[18:50] <mizifih> XHEART24: go to software/application center and search for it
[18:50] <Dr_willis> you need to determine what file formats/codecs it can play.
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest29223
[18:51] <Dr_willis> it could be you just need to rename the video.mp4 to be video.avi
[18:51] <XHEART24> i have not tried that
[18:52] <nanvou> hellp
[18:52] <mizifih> XHEART24: oh, yeah, mp4 and avi are containers
[18:52] <nanvou> I'm trying to enable vino-server
[18:52] <nanvou> by using "gsettings set org.gnome.Vino enabled true"
[18:52] <mizifih> Dr_willis is right
[18:52] <nanvou> but I get a "WARNING **: Command line `dbus-launch --autolaunch=bcd88addab015d57f51cd3e60000047e --binary-syntax --close-stderr' exited with non-zero exit status 1: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed."
[18:52] <XHEART24> by changing from mp4 to avi will it increase in size?
[18:53] <Dr_willis> if you can find a video it CAN play. you can see what codec its using
[18:53] <mizifih> Dr_willis: I believe avidemux do not convert what doesn't need to be converted
[18:53] <Dr_willis> ive been converting videos with avidemux all week... ;)
[18:53] <nanvou> how do I do that ?
[18:53] <mizifih> XHEART24: it depends on what you're going to do with the file, but he's saying just to change the extension
[18:53] <Dr_willis> XHEART24,  just try changeing the name.
[18:53] <XHEART24> ok thanks, you are so kind guys, take care
[18:54] <tony> hay gud
[18:54] <mizifih> XHEART24: wait
[18:54] <XHEART24> yes?
[18:54] <mizifih> XHEART24: that was a suggestion, trying to rename the filename (extension), but Avidemux can convert it for you
[18:54] <mizifih> for sure
[18:54] <brian____> Is it easy to change the 'waiting for network configuration' timeout?  I would prefer to have it set to 10 seconds instead of 120seconds..
[18:54] <Dr_willis> arista can also convert and has dozens of presets
[18:54] <nick14> shouldn't file give you a clue as to what type it is?
=== Fudge is now known as Guest82390
[18:55] <mizifih> nick14: kinda
[18:55] <Dr_willis> if you can find a video it CAN play. you can see what codec its using, the vlc player can tell you exactly the specs of the working video
[18:55] <mizifih> nick14: but mp4 files can contain a xvid video track, I believe
[18:55] <mizifih> I don't know
[18:55] <mizifih> video stuff is really crazy these days
[18:55] <XHEART24> the video plays well on the pc but not on the media player
[18:56] <XHEART24> thx for the help
[18:56] <Dr_willis> XHEART24,  again.. find a video that plays on the player.. and then we can determine what format its using.
[18:56] <mizifih> XHEART24: well... you'll have to convert it
[18:56] <XHEART24> ok
[18:56] <mizifih> AVI is not a video format
[18:56] <mizifih> it's just a container
[18:56] <Dr_willis> it might just need tobe called whatever.avi   instead of whatever.mp4
[18:56] <Dr_willis> or it might have to be some specific codecs
[18:57] <mizifih> Sony...
[18:57] <mizifih> It's probablu AVC something
[18:57] <mizifih> probably*
[18:57] <mizifih> is it AVC... I had some trouble with my PSP back when I used it to play videos
[18:57] <Dr_willis> hard to tell with sony these days.. the PSP i recall played mp4's but they had to be special encoded
[18:57] <mizifih> avc
[18:57] <mizifih> I think it was avc, if the name is right
[18:57] <nick14> mizifih: right, just a container?
[18:58] <mizifih> AVI, yeah
[18:58] <mizifih> Dr_willis: say the word, LOL
[18:58] <mizifih> Dr_willis: AVI just a container?
[18:58] <Dr_willis> you could hit up google for the exact name/type/make of the player  and find its specs as to what it can play.
[18:59] <CarlFK> apt-get install ssl-cert - that threw up some dialogs.  I want to see them again.  shouldn't apt-get purge ssl-cert; apt-get install ssl-cert do the same install ?
