No matter on what kind of server I connect to (ssh or ftp...), I am never allowed to change file-permissions, because Nautilus is claiming that I am not the owner of the files. I am the owner and it worked before in 3 different programs on 2 different OSes ...What is wrong??

[00:04] <Ubuntu> newbie on linux here :(
[00:04] <kandinski> fyrestrtr: thanks. let me load the machine till load shoots up, and check memory usage then.
[00:04] <fyrestrtr> Ubuntu: ask a question :)
[00:04] <VigoFusion> Learning is fun!
[00:05] <paragon36> Ive asked the following many times does no one know the answer  ????
[00:05] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt: but, no one on the outside network can access that anyway
[00:05] <paragon36> I can set the mtu size via # ifconfig eth0 mtu 1492 but where does one set the MTU size permanently?
[00:05] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt:its limitited for inside-network only!
[00:05] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: the setting is in the configuration file, I don't recall what it is off the top. Use scp if you can.
[00:05] <sc4ttrbrain> paragon36: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=291123
[00:05] <fyrestrtr> paragon36: /etc/networking/
[00:05] <sc4ttrbrain> paragon36: but not the exact solution
[00:06] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt:scp? (sorry if im pissing you off, i dont really know anything about profptd)
[00:06] <paragon36> Ueah I thought that /etc/networking/interfaces
[00:06] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: scp is secure copy. A way to transfer files using encryption. A lot better than FTP.
[00:06] <paragon36> but cant see anything there as an example for mtu...
[00:06] <Ubuntu> hello again
[00:06] <fyrestrtr> paragon36: man interfaces should tell you
[00:06] <Ubuntu> it's about how to use gfxboot
[00:07] <Ubuntu> the graphical splashscrren
[00:07] <fyrestrtr> what about it?
[00:07] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt:but i dont need encryption or anything, im the only person in about 2kms radious that knows anything about this stuff
[00:07] <quik_> I want to kill a process (in a script) that is named (I don't know the pid) ... using kill -HUP

[00:08] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: then ftp as root.
[00:08] <trope> if you're going to use an ftp daemon use vsftpd
[00:08] <kuzmaster> fyrestrt:but HOW?

[00:09] <kuzmaster> ok, thanx
[00:09] <fyrestrtr> kuzmaster: then, create a password for root user, and login using that.

[02:35] <huiber1> dawkirst: you could try to disable dma, but you will see the same error when you are trying to read a scratched cd
[02:35] <thomas> hey guys i'm having some trouble installing nvidia drivers, wondering if anybody could be of help
[02:35] <hikenboot> HydrageN did you do chmod a+rwx NVIDIA-Linux....run?
[02:36] <HydrageN> no ill try wait
[02:36] <dawkirst> huiber1: What is dma? And I had problems with my previous CD-Rom too -- it crashed Ubuntu. Do you think it has something to do with a faulty hardware piece, like IDE cable or something?

[02:38] <JJones0207> It just says Your installation cd could not be mounted this prob means that the cd rom was not in the drive and you can insert it now and try again but it is in the cd rom drive
[02:38] <VigoFusion> Placid: no idea CD detect?
[02:39] <dawkirst> Thanks huiber1. If it gives any more problems I'll try to disable it, but it was only sluggish while making an image of a DVD, so maybe that's just normal?
[02:39] <IdleOne> JJones0207:  try taking it out and putting it back in?

[02:39] <zainka> Hi... I need to compile a program, but Ubunto 6,06 cant find the make utility running Terminal. I guess I have to install teh make/compiler somehow, but is this package a part of the distro or do I need to find it online somewhere???
[02:40] <huiber1> dawkirst: But I got the same error once, bacause if incorrectly burned or scratched media.

[02:47] <cmt^^> zaan - I had the exact same problem
[02:48] <cmt^^> zaan - press alt+f2 when in the menu
[02:48] <zaan> aha
[02:48] <cmt^^> and edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:48] <huiber1> zaan: sound like you ati card is not used correctly, have you try to start with boot option "failsave", or tried to use vesa? (probably not)
[02:48] <scane__> what is the background for "aptitude install mc" not working on 6.10 amd64 ?
[02:48] <cmt^^> change driver="ati" to driver="vesa"
[02:48] <huiber1> zaan: ignore me, listen to cmt^^
[02:48] <cmt^^> heh
[02:48] <zaan> okay cmt and huiber1
[02:48] <cmt^^> there's a guide somewhere
[02:48] <zaan> let me try that right now
[02:48] <cmt^^> but that's the first step
[02:48] <KomiaPoika> how can i install xv 3.10a in ubuntu?
[02:48] <zaan> I'm working on 2 computers
[02:48] <huiber1> JJones0207: so your booting of usb atm?
[02:48] <cmt^^> then u need to install fglrx
[02:48] <zaan> what is the second step?
[02:49] <cmt^^> but changing driver to vesa will get you through the installation

[02:51] <cmt^^> try changing the resolution of the setup by pressing F4 (I think, there are tips on the bottom of the screen)

[02:53] <cmt^^> huiber1 - I did alt+f2
[02:53] <cmt^^> might be different on other systems
[02:53] <jrib> zainka: sudo apt-get install build-essential    should just install a package.  Can you be more specific about what asked you for a destination?  Pastebin the output please
