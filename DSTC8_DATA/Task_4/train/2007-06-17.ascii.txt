[05:22] <mister_roboto> Guest399: it certainly does matter if you ever intend to use "ls" on those directories
[05:22] <kanzie_> gnea: But what filetype should I specify to use the Fuse
[05:23] <mister_roboto> Guest399: you need execute permission to search a directory (on the dir i mean)

[06:07] <nathalie> It plays about one frame pro sec, then freezes and needs to be killed.

[06:50] <IntuitiveNipple> ianian: So correct the command so it is applied to the correct directory name - I'm just guessing!
[06:50] <KDDI> which is more cool?
[06:50] <cables> KDDI: actually, try "ubuntu-desktop" instead of gnome-desktop.

[06:50] <morpheusdreams> good evening, could omeone give me a hand with PHP?
[06:50] <KDDI> erm hw?
[06:50] <cables> KDDI: it's a matter of opinion.
[06:50] <mage> KDDI: since you downloaded both, may as well try both desktop environments
[06:50] <ChiFLiiiii> hi all
[06:50] <Megaqwerty> jeayese: I'm sorry I actually have to leave :( but try the "Instructions for 6.10 (Edgy)" section here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[06:50] <KDDI> cos i seen xcf.. ss very nice
[06:50] <mage> actually I downloaded all three at varying locations :)
[06:50] <PurpZeY_> mage: That's true but now he has two entire file systems.
[06:51] <cables> KDDI: Kubuntu has a slightly more complex UI, but it's more advanced. Gnome is simpler and easier. XFCE is fast and uses less RAM.
[06:51] <Nutubuntu> morpheusdreams,  I think there's a #php chan
[06:51] <twikesh> morpheusdreams: try asking in ##php, this is the Ubuntu support channel

[06:54] <cables> KDDI: A common misconception is that KDE is the most windows-like. However, all of them are VERY customizable.
[06:54] <mage> k1gwb: so the laptop actually has that feature?
