[03:50] <arthur_> Hello
[03:50] <arthur_> Hi
[03:55] <nomadist> hi
[03:56] <Ahmuck> Hi.  A script tries to run in the background when using hplip printing.  It appears it is trying to connect to a server when printing is done.  This is a brand new install.
[03:56] <Ahmuck> A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, open the script in the debugger, or let the script continue.
[03:56] <Ahmuck> Script: http://static-hp-eus.s-msn.com/_h/d6ea042c/webcore/externalscripts/jquery/jquery-2.1.1.min.js:2
[03:57] <Ahmuck> hp script?
[03:57] <teward> Ahmuck: actually, that looks like jquery embedded in MSN's site
[03:57] <Jen8> teward are you still here i am still having problems with the server with tcl8.5 you have pastebin i cna show you the problem
[03:57] <nomadist> I cannot access github. Every other website works fine. How do I debug this?
[03:57] <Ahmuck> hrm, ok.  maybe coincidence that it happened at the same moment i printed a test page.
[03:58] <teward> Jen8: use the Ubuntu pastebin if you do
[03:58] <nomadist> even from the command line
[03:58] <teward> Ahmuck: probably is, the hplip scripts aren't externally on those locations :P
[03:58] <Ahmuck> i just now saw the msn reference.  i think i saw the hp reference first
[03:58] <Jen8> can you give me address of that please
[03:58] <teward> !pastebin > Jen8
[03:58] <ubottu> Jen8, please see my private message
[03:58] <nomadist> telnet github.com
[03:58] <nomadist> telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
[03:59] <teward> nomadist: um... why're you telnet-ing them anyways
[03:59] <teward> nomadist: do other sites work?
[03:59] <nomadist> teward, yes. Can't open with browser either
[03:59] <teward> Jen8: check your PMs - ubottu sent you the paste link probably.
[03:59] <teward> nomadist: and pings are being responded to?
[04:00] <teward> (or are they too not working with github)
[04:00] <nomadist> teward, it seems so, for example
[04:00] <nomadist> ping github.com
[04:00] <nomadist> PING github.com (59.185.3.14) 56(84) bytes of data.
[04:00] <nomadist> 64 bytes from static-mum-59.185.3.14.mtnl.net.in (59.185.3.14): icmp_seq=1 ttl=45 time=122 ms
[04:00] <nomadist> keep getting this until I control-c
[04:00] <nomadist> 6 packets transmitted, 5 received, 16% packet loss, time 5003ms
[04:00] <teward> nomadist: that looks like poisoned DNS
[04:01] <nomadist> teward, huh?
[04:01] <teward> nomadist: github runs everything from 192.30.252.0/22 - which is NOT 59.185.3.14
[04:01] <teward> (https://help.github.com/articles/what-ip-addresses-does-github-use-that-i-should-whitelist/ is the source there)
[04:02] <teward> nomadist: a DNS lookup on Google's DNS shows the same - it looks like your DNS servers that you query for everything are wrong, or possibly poisoned
[04:02] <nomadist> teward, like everything else on that domain I can't open it
[04:02] <nomadist> how do I change my DNS servers?
[04:02] <teward> nomadist: in network manager and the settings for your network of choice
[04:02] <Ahmuck> my error.  printing works without script error
[04:03] <teward> Ahmuck: yeah, probably their JQuery got stuck for some reason :)
[04:03] <teward> nomadist: right click network manager, hit "Edit COnnections"
[04:03] <teward> select the connection you use
[04:03] <teward> nomadist: IPv4 settings tab.  Method: (set to Automatic (DHCP) addresses only)
[04:03] <Jen8> teward  http://paste.ubuntu.com/9585807/
[04:04] <teward> nomadist: in the DNS Servers: box, add these: 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4,4.2.2.4
[04:04] <teward> nomadist: (first two are Google DNS, last one is one of Level3's DNS servers)
[04:04] <Ahmuck> i moved from Debian basic to Lubuntu.  I've put in two swap partitions at the end of the drive to help things out but it
[04:04] <Ahmuck> it's quite slow.
[04:05] <teward> Jen8: what's thea ctual error you see when you're working with the bot
[04:05] <Ahmuck> Should the swap be in between the root and the home partition?
[04:05] <teward> Jen8: that what you've shown me is irrelevant, i need to see what's actually being sought after and such
[04:05] <Jen8> when we install the tcl
[04:05] <teward> (by eggdrop)
[04:05] <Ahmuck> the root partition is at the beginning of the drive.
[04:05] <abator> x11vnc client when move mouse i can see mouse pointer movin on server but i want to see mouse pointer moving when i move mouse on server, how do change this behaviour?
[04:05] <nomadist> teward, I don't see "Edit connections" how can I get to this?
[04:05] <teward> Jen8: I need to see what eggdrop is complaining about - and the exact error it generates.
[04:05] <teward> nomadist: which Ubuntu version?
[04:05] <nomadist> 14.04 (gnome)
[04:05] <Jen8> teward thats when we try installing tcl8.5
[04:06] <Jen8> one you told me do sudo apt-get install tcl8.5
[04:06] <teward> Jen8: stop
[04:06] <teward> Jen8: I just asked you: "When you run EggDrop, which needs TCL 8.5, what actually does it say?  Does it error?"
[04:06] <teward> Jen8: and if the answer to that is "Yes", then show me the error output
[04:07] <Jen8> okay
[04:07] <Jen8> brb
[04:07] <nomadist> teward, 1404 gnome
[04:07] <teward> nomadist: ahh, okay, I have standard Unity, give me a moment
[04:09] <Jen8> http://paste.ubuntu.com/9585849/
[04:09] <teward> nomadist: i'm not sure how exactly to edit the connections in the GNOME variant - so, lets try a temporary alternative method...
[04:09] <Jen8> teward
[04:09] <Jen8> thats new one
[04:10] <teward> nomadist: better, actually, try left-click and right click on your network manager - one of those might show an "Edit" type option to edit your connections
[04:10] <teward> Jen8: how're you installing eggdrop in the first place
[04:10] <teward> Jen8: from their source tarball?
[04:10] <nomadist> i think its better if I go to unity
[04:10] <nomadist> teward, brb getting into unity
[04:11] <abator> i want to see mouse movement on both client and server simultaniously but on client mouse pointer does not move when server is moving mouse

[04:12] <Ahmuck> is there a program similar to dragon dictate
[04:13] <teward> Jen8: okay, you need the -dev package not just tcl8.5
[04:13] <lotuspsychje> good morning
[04:13] <teward> Jen8: and if you go back to where I told you how to install tcl8.5, I also mentioned you might actually need the tcl8.5-dev package

[04:23] <lotuspsychje> abator: if you ask your question, others can help you
[04:23] <Bluewolf> lotuspsychje: Okay thought as much, but I also thought it would be higher and confirm it is the better on to download?
[04:23] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: if you download 14.04 and update manual, it will get to 14.04.1 also
[04:24] <abator> lotuspsychje: i did ask, let me do it again, thanks for responding, i want to see mouse movement on both client and server simultaneously but on client mouse pointer does not move when server is moving mouse
[04:24] <lotuspsychje> !vnc | abator
[04:24] <ubottu> abator: VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[04:24] <Bluewolf> lotuspsychje: Got it, so it does not matter in the long run?
[04:25] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: if 14.04 LTS is your base, it will update also to newer version of 14.04

[04:36] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: you can autohide unity left bar if you like and install docky, for a gnome-like feeling
[04:37] <lotuspsychje> azjo: where did you get this teamviewer?
[04:38] <azjo> from teamviewer.com

[04:43] <Guest58978> hello.  i am attempting to install ubuntu 14.10, and need some help.  my computer currently has ubuntu 14.04, windows 7, and linux mint 17 installed on it, and in the installer there was no "replace ubuntu 14.04 with ubuntu 14.10 option" like there sometimes is, so I am forced to select "Something else", and use the partition editor feature.  I am in need of assistance.  my old ubuntu 14.04 install that I wish to replace
[04:43] <Guest58978> with a new ubuntu 14.10 install is on /dev/sda6, an ext4 filesystem..  please help.  thanks in advance.
[04:43] <lotuspsychje> Jen8: maybe the #tcl guys might be able to help
[04:43] <cryptodan> nomadist: can you dpaste.com the results of cat /etc/resolv.conf
[04:43] <lotuspsychje> azjo: try installing it from the web
[04:44] <azjo> u mean terminal?
[04:44] <lotuspsychje> azjo: no, download the .deb package from their website
[04:44] <nomadist> cryptodan, http://dpaste.com/2CT7KNB
[04:44] <azjo> yeah thats what i did
[04:44] <azjo> and it says it is installed
[04:44] <azjo> but its nowhere to be found in software center installed programs
[04:44] <cryptodan> nomadist: check your modem to see if you have wrong dns servers there
[04:45] <nomadist> cryptodan, how do i do that?
[04:45] <cryptodan> nomadist: login to the router / modem via the web interface
[04:46] <lotuspsychje> azjo: can you find the teamviewer icon in your dash ?
[04:46] <Guest58978> i am looking for the simplest way to do this.  i tried double clicking on the partition i wish to use, and selecting "use as ext4 filesystem" and "format the partition", and setting the mount point to "/", and when i then highlight the drive and click "install now", i get the popup which says i need to select a partition for use as swap space.  how do i do that?
[04:46] <nomadist> cryptodan, I tether from the 3g network on my phone
[04:46] <nomadist> and this problem never happened
[04:46] <cryptodan> nomadist: power cycle your phone and see if you get new DNS Servers
[04:47] <nomadist> cryptodan, ok. Will be disconnected for that. I'll be back.

[04:48] <azjo> so why isnt it in software center, but shows in dash?
[04:48] <azjo> yes, its starting up now
[04:49] <Guest58978> ok, i found how to do it, but i do not know which area to make be the swap

[04:57] <cfhowlett> azjo, repos aren't slow but your software source might be ....
[04:57] <scragglez> likecolacola: yeah, I have it in /usr/include/ImageMagick/wand
[04:57] <tyraN|a> and then what?
[04:58] <tyraN|a> :
[04:58] <cryptodan> tyraN|a: the server name
[04:58] <tyraN|a> :D
[04:58] <purana> azjo,
[04:58] <azjo> i want one that doesnt require 500mb tho
[04:58] <tyraN|a> undernet ?
[04:58] <purana> azjo,  wakeonlan
[04:58] <purana> azjo, cli tool
[04:58] <tyraN|a> what should i write in the <port> field? hehe :p
[04:58] <cryptodan> it should automatically go there
[04:58] <purana> tyraN|a, dont type anything it will default
[04:58] <Guest58978> cfhowlett, ok thanks...  is there a way of knowing which one of the swap partitions i currently have is the mint 17 swap space, and which is the ubuntu swap?
[04:59] <lotuspsychje> azjo: apt-cache search wake on lan, shows a few
[04:59] <tyraN|a> what you mean it will default? lol
[04:59] <purana> tyraN|a, it will probably use 6667 by default
[04:59] <tyraN|a> purana thanks ;)
[04:59] <_nomadist> hey yo cryptodan. thanks for identifying the problem.
[04:59] <_nomadist> I found the solution here: http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/154538
[04:59] <purana> remind me to sleep early tonight I am feeling so tired
[04:59] <cfhowlett> Guest58978, I see 2 /swaps on your paste ...
[04:59] <azjo> downloading wakeonlan. which i couldnt find when i searched wake on
[05:00] <cryptodan> _nomadist: you are welcome
[05:00] <purana> Guest58978, I saw 2 swaps too, no idea which is whic, as you should of made note during last install which one you used
[05:00] <lotuspsychje> !yay | azjo
[05:00] <ubottu> azjo: Glad you made it! :-)

[05:00] <peyam> hi, I have gtk3 installed on y xubuntu. does it mean I can install gnome themes?
[05:00] <lotuspsychje> !themes | peyam

[05:01] <cfhowlett> Guest58978, eh, fuser is the command to ID a FILE process uuser --- not a partition
[05:01] <azjo> purana: is wakeonlan with a gui?
[05:01] <Guest58978> i love linux and ubuntu so much  :)  and seasons greetings to the ubuntu community that makes this os so great!
[05:01] <purana> Guest58978, boot into gentoo and check the /etc/fstab, it will show which partitation swap is mounted from
[05:01] <peyam> lotuspsychje, was it a correct anwer?
[05:01] <purana> azjo, cli only ;) shell use
[05:01] <purana> azjo, man wakeonlan post install in a terminal/shell window for how to use it
[05:01] <purana> azjo, super easy one to use though
[05:02] <lotuspsychje> peyam: you can aks the #xubuntu guys whats the easiest way
[05:02] <zero00> My monitor resolution and screen refresh rate keeps resetting back to "automatic resolution and 60 hz" after every gaming session. What gives?
[05:02] <azjo> what do i type to err execute it?
[05:02] <peyam> lotuspsychje, so it is possible? no #xubuntu is always asleep
[05:02] <purana> azjo, wakeonlan
[05:03] <azjo> i figured that out myself. *proud* ;p
[05:03] <lotuspsychje> peyam: im sure xubuntu can have themese aswell yes, check deviantart.com => search xubuntu for examples
[05:03] <purana> azjo, wakeonlan [-h] [-v] [-i IP_address] [-p port] [-f file]
[05:03] <purana>        [[hardware_address] ...]
[05:03] <peyam> lotuspsychje, do you even read what i writing?
[05:04] <purana> peyam, eye candy I can live without.. guess others cannot..
[05:04] <lotuspsychje> peyam: whats that suppose to mean?
[05:04] <azjo> hmm, i used mac to wol from windows. but there isnt an option regarding mac here?
[05:04] <purana> azjo, yes hardware address = MAC address
[05:04] <purana> azjo, same thing
[05:04] <peyam> purana, me too but i thogh i would test some changes. lotuspsychje that means my question was if i have gtk3 can I use gnome themes?
[05:05] <azjo> so i simply type wakeonlan -f XX-XX-XX etc?
[05:05] <purana> azjo, yes probably without the -'s
[05:05] <lotuspsychje> peyam: did you even read the themes trigger i pasted you?
[05:05] <azjo> so just the 12 digits in one?
[05:05] <purana> azjo, I think I have a script I wrote that uses it, let me check
[05:05] <peyam> lotuspsychje, yes. i expected a Yes or No
[05:06] <purana> azjo, think my laptop is downstairs..
[05:06] <cfhowlett> lol
[05:06] <lotuspsychje> peyam: life is never what You expect..
[05:06] <devcros7s> .___.
[05:06] <peyam> lotuspsychje, agree
[05:06] <azjo> ill try the 12 digit and see what happens
[05:06] <devcros7s> hola mundo ! :D
[05:06] <purana> azjo, it will either be in the format of XX:XX:XX... etc

[05:07] <purana> azjo, been a while since I used it
[05:07] <azjo> aha
[05:07] <azjo> its not possible to wol a machine which is on wifi, right?
[05:07] <purana> azjo, yes its wakeonlan 00:00:00:00:00:00
[05:08] <purana> azjo, does wifi even support WoL?
[05:08] <purana> azjo, I dont think it does ;)
[05:08] <azjo> yeah, kinda impossible heh but i had to ask
[05:08] <purana> azjo, seems some wifi does according to google.. but I don't like chances on that
[05:09] <purana> its sunday afternoon, work again tomorrow *sigh*
[05:09] <azjo> its only to test right now, since im on the machine i want to wol, but im not gonna shut it down now so ill wait
[05:09] <lotuspsychje> peyam: http://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/?qh=&section=&global=1&q=xubuntu+gtk3
[05:10] <peyam> thanks
[05:10] <purana> azjo, I use to have a rpi with webserver and script that when I hit a webpage, it would execute the wakeonlan script to wake up another pc, which I could teamviewer against.. it would sleep again, and I would hit web page on rpi to wake it :)
[05:10] <purana> azjo, worked rather well ;)
[05:11] <azjo> clever
[05:11] <azjo> rpi?
[05:11] <purana> azjo, think I gave the webserver unix user sudo access to run script explicitly
[05:11] <purana> rpi = raspberry pi
[05:11] <azjo> thought so

[05:15] <azjo> hmm interesting. whats the cost of a nuc with 8gb ram? i want it as cheap as possible
[05:16] <purana> azjo, you would need to research where you live.. I live in Oz

[05:16] <purana> azjo, Australia
[05:17] <azjo> Oz means australia, or its a specific area?

[05:18] <purana> azjo, shit in my area ;) ADSL2+ only, but I am moving to a newer estate in the next 18 months where my house is fibre to the home
[05:19] <azjo> oh great
[05:19] <purana> azjo, so will get 50Mbps/20Mbps link or maybe a 100Mbps/40Mbps.. still deciding
[05:19] <azjo> im on 60/60mbps fibre now, more than enough for me :p
[05:19] <purana> azjo, my adsl sync atm is about 16900/1090
[05:20] <purana> azjo, in Kbps
[05:20] <purana> haha
[05:20] <azjo> better
[05:20] <purana> azjo, it does what I need..
[05:20] <azjo> acceptable i guess, but i love fibre more for the low pings
[05:20] <purana> azjo, new house/estate will be better
[05:21] <lotuspsychje> guys keep it ontopic please
[05:21] <purana> azjo, sorted wakeonlan yet?
[05:21] <azjo> i can ping other side of city @ 2ms.. adsl usually means the conversion take 20 ping

[05:26] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: your issue is solved?
[05:28] <iampoz> hi guys, anyone know the story about vlc?
[05:28] <Bluewolf> lotuspsychje: Ah not quite, I'm just reading up on Ubuntu Gnome and trying to figure out the difference between it and plain ubuntu with the gnome shell?
[05:28] <iampoz> I am getting this error: "Failed to fetch http://download.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/Sources  404  Not Found"
[05:28] <lotuspsychje> iampoz: wich ubuntu version are you on?
[05:28] <cfhowlett> iampoz, what is cat /etc/issue telling you?
[05:29] <iampoz> this seems to be related http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg4572884.html
[05:29] <iampoz> 14.04
[05:29] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: if your graphics be able to run it, gnome will run smooth
[05:29] <iampoz> Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS \n \l
[05:29] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: just go try and install to experience :p
[05:30] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: maybe the #gnome guys might also set you in the right direction
[05:31] <Bluewolf> lotuspsychje: Oh I am but the choices are going to be my end, suse, debian, ubuntu and now ubuntu Gnome, any idea on the least buggy? :D
[05:31] <lotuspsychje> iampoz: you added ppa's in some sort?
[05:31] <iampoz> yes
[05:31] <lotuspsychje> !ppa | iampoz
[05:31] <ubottu> iampoz: A Personal Package Archive (PPA) can provide alternate software not normally available in the offical Ubuntu repositories - Looking for a PPA? See https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas - WARNING: PPAs are unsupported third-party packages, and you use them at your own risk. See also !addppa and !ppa-purge
[05:31] <iampoz> I am guessing this is not supported here eh?
[05:31] <cfhowlett> !ppa | iampoz
[05:32] <purana> cfhowlett, commands for channel operators
[05:32] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: i would advise you a 14.04 ubuntu variant, ubuntu, ubuntu-gnome, xubuntu, lubuntu
[05:32] <iampoz> humm, I will see if if the vlc irc room can help me out. I just thought some one here might know about it.
[05:33] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: 14.04 is rocksolid and support till 2014
[05:33] <cfhowlett> purana, since when?  I/we have been using factoid triggers for a LONG time
[05:33] <purana> zzzgeoffb, hello fellow australian user :)
[05:33] <purana> cfhowlett, your command generated no output
[05:33] <lotuspsychje> purana: triggers are for everyone, related to the questions..
[05:33] <purana> lotuspsychje, good to know
[05:34] <Bluewolf> lotuspsychje: Yeah I will continue the checking, Ubuntu and Ubuntu Gnome are two separate Os like xubuntu, lubuntu and so on right?
[05:34] <Cobra> LOL
[05:34] <cfhowlett> purana, ah.  I triggered it right after the same command was sent by lotuspsyche.  in such cases, trigger #2 is ignored.
[05:34] <purana> cfhowlett, had a feeling that was possible too
[05:34] <Cobra> aye guys.
[05:34] <lotuspsychje> !flavors | Bluewolf
[05:34] <ubottu> Bluewolf: !Ubuntu-GNOME, !Kubuntu, !Xubuntu and !Lubuntu are simply flavors of Ubuntu that come with GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and LXDE (respectively) installed as default, instead of Unity. Other specialized flavors of Ubuntu include !Edubuntu, Ubuntu !Studio, and !Mythbuntu.
=== patjuh is now known as Waakhond
[05:37] <Cobra> hmm.
[05:38] <Bluewolf> lotuspsychje: That clears things up, you said "14.04 is rocksolid and support till 2014" is that all, were at its end?
[05:38] <mdanielk> :)
[05:38] <cfhowlett> Bluewolf, 3 years for 14.04 = 2017 on desktop.  5 years for server
[05:38] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: support til 2020, after that another LTS version come
[05:39] <cfhowlett> !lts | Bluewolf
[05:39] <ubottu> Bluewolf: LTS means Long Term Support. Until 12.04 LTS versions of Ubuntu were supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; since 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) LTS versions will be supported for 5 years on the desktop and server. The latest LTS version of Ubuntu is !Trusty (Trusty Tahr 14.04)
[05:40] <cfhowlett> Bluewolf, lotuspsychje I was wrong: 14.05 has 5 years support / except for ubuntustudio = 3 years only
[05:40] <Bluewolf> lotuspsychje: Thanks man, you just might have made my day and christmas :D
[05:41] <iampoz> is there a way to do an update and skip a particular ppa?
[05:41] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: your xmass will come tru after installing ubuntu version of your dreams :p
[05:41] <lotuspsychje> !pinning | iampoz maybe this
[05:41] <ubottu> iampoz maybe this: pinning is an advanced feature that APT can use to prefer particular packages over others. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
[05:42] <lotuspsychje> iampoz: but the most logical way, would be remove your ppa :p
[05:43] <iampoz> lol well I did, but I know I will forget to add it again later... videolan chat said that download.videolan.org is down right now
[05:43] <lotuspsychje> iampoz: did you sudo apt-get install vlc?
[05:44] <lotuspsychje> cfhowlett: you know that trigger for ppa remove?
[05:44] <iampoz> vlc is already installed, I was just doing an update and it was giving the error that it could not connect
[05:44] <cfhowlett> lotuspsychje, no idea.  (I staz quiet when I haz no infoz.)
[05:45] <Bluewolf> lotuspsychje: I'll remember to convert Santa as you have done me :P
[05:45] <Bluewolf> Thanks again, best wishes!
[05:45] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: cheers
[05:46] <lotuspsychje> iampoz: maybe try to update ubuntu later on
[05:46] <lotuspsychje> iampoz: maybe apt-get update and reboot can do miracles
=== FreeNod is now known as DarthTetris
[05:48] <iampoz> thanks lotuspsychje, it was a clean boot, but I will reboot after the update I am doing now and add the ppa. maybe it will work then, but I don't think so if the videolan irc chat is saying that it is down
[05:48] <HZun> is it fine to skip the "select and install software" step of the ubuntu mini.iso expert installer when doing a minimal installation? will it prevent the system from being installed correctly?
[05:49] <lotuspsychje> !minimal | HZun
[05:49] <ubottu> HZun: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want.  The installer is text based (rather than graphical as used on the Desktop DVD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[05:50] <lotuspsychje> !ppapurge | iampoz
[05:50] <ubottu> iampoz: To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: <unconvertable> sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> <unconvertable> <unconvertable> For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html
[05:50] <waxhead_> first build on an uefi system.... really doing my head in.. :-/
[05:50] <HZun> lotuspsychje: yes i know what the mini.iso is. the question was weather i can "safely" skip the "select and install software" step.
[05:52] <waxhead_> in saying that, got the OS building to RAID1 second time around... lets see how things go on reboot
[05:54] <iampoz> yikes, I don't want to purge my ppas!
[05:55] <iampoz> i just went into software center and clicked the videolan ppa off and updated. works fine now... I just think I will forget to toggle it back on after a few days when it might be back online so I was asking how to temporarily exclude a ppa from an update. I don't think pinning is what I want, so maybe I  don't understand how to use it.

[08:08] <waxhead_>  Any tricks to this UEFI booting stuff?
[08:09] <cfhowlett> !uefi | waxhead_
[08:09] <ubottu> waxhead_: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[08:09] <waxhead_> installing to 120G SDD, doesn't seem to be able to boot up
[08:09] <cfhowlett> waxhead_, that's a NEW SSD?
[08:10] <waxhead_> cfhowlett, newish...
[08:10] <waxhead_> cfhowlett, probably 18 months old
[08:10] <waxhead_> older maybe!
[08:10] <cfhowlett> waxhead_, never done that but as I understand, the ssd/hdd needs to be prepped before install/use
[08:10] <PK2> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+mirror/ftp.crihan.fr-archive mirror seems to work
[08:10] <waxhead_> cfhowlett, I'll google it then..
[08:11] <rwp> waxhead_, Can you change the bios to BIOS booting instead of UEFI? If so that is probably easiest.
[08:11] <rwp> Many BIOS's have that as an option.
[08:11] <waxhead_> rwp, yes, did that but it still didn't boot...
[08:12] <waxhead_> I get the flashing 'underscore'
[08:12] <waxhead_> it doesn't seem to progress through to booting
[08:12] <PK2> rwp: mistaked
[08:12] <rwp> Hmm... Strange. Don't know.
[08:12] <PK2> BIOSs should be correct
[08:12] <PK2> Typo. :p
[08:13] <rwp> Not BIOSes? :-)
[08:13] <PK2> Nah.
[08:13] <rwp> BIOSii?
[08:13] <PK2> Nooo.
[08:13] <PK2> BIOSs
[08:13]  * rwp chuckles
[08:13] <PK2> "s" means it's plural
[08:13] <PK2> But still "es" is not meant to be there...
[08:13] <JoshH99> Hey I have an apache install on 14.04. I've set "ServerTokens Prod" and "ServerSignature off" in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, but apache still exposes its version in the header and on error pages
[08:14] <cfhowlett> bios'    is the correct form ...
[08:14] <rwp> In any case my latest hit on the UEFI problem I couldn't get Ubuntu to install either.
[08:14] <Patser> Hi, does anybody know where to get libhttp-cookie-perl? None of the servers seem to have it and my system is compaining that my packages are broken...
[08:14] <rwp> But was able to switch to legacy BIOS boot and that worked perfectly fine.
[08:14] <cfhowlett> joshh20, if no answer here, ask #ubuntu-server
[08:14] <JoshH99> cfhowlett: ok, wasn't aware of that channel
[08:14] <PK2> JoshH99: Have you restarted Apache2 so it takes your new configs. ?
[08:14] <rwp> JoshH99, Did you remember to reload or restart after the change?
[08:14] <cfhowlett> !server | joshh20
[08:14] <ubottu> joshh20: Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments, including a server specific !kernel and no !GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current !LTS version is !Trusty (Trusty Tahr 14.04) - More info: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/serveredition - Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide - Support in #ubuntu-server
[08:15] <JoshH99> PK2: I have, but I'll try again just for the heck of it
[08:15] <PK2> OK.
[08:15] <cfhowlett> joshh20, sorry, meant for your older bro, JoshH99
[08:15] <PK2> Aaand: well, that mirror worked fine. o.O
[08:15] <JoshH99> PK2: Just ran again for sanity check. Still exposes server as "Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)"
[08:15] <rwp> JoshH99, Also, the /etc/apache2/conf.d/security file sets it on. So if you don't change it there it will be on.
[08:15] <JoshH99> rwp: will check that file
[08:15] <PK2> lol
[08:16] <rwp> JoshH99,
[08:16] <rwp> JoshH99, Meanwhile I don't think turning it off has any security merit.
[08:16] <waxhead_> rwp, I'll have another go then back at legacy
[08:17] <rwp> waxhead_, This reference is Debian not Ubuntu but I happened to have read it today. http://blog.einval.com/2014/12/21#Jessie-EFI_2
[08:17] <PK2> Oh God...
[08:17] <PK2> It's written today !?
[08:18] <JoshH99> rwp: Yeah, it's a very little thing. I'm paranoid and so I like to reduce information I give out in headers if possible. I edited /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf and restarted, and the problem is fixed.
[08:18] <rwp> Yes. Is that shocking?
[08:18] <JoshH99> thanks PK2 and rwp
[08:18] <rwp> JoshH99, Good deal.
=== _sic__ is now known as _sic_
[08:18] <PK2> Welcome..
[08:19] <rwp> JoshH99, Yes, mostly there is no need to edit the apache.conf file.  Most edits go into conf.d/foo-something-file instead.
=== Zer0legend is now known as Ankoran
[08:19] <JoshH99> rwp: When was this changed? Was it in one of the last ubuntu releases?
[08:19] <rwp> I always put my own files into a foo-local.conf something so that upgrades won't overwrite it and/or I don't need to merge at upgrade time.
[08:19] <JoshH99> rwp: Assuming all the files get included into the apache config automatically?
[08:19] <rwp> JoshH99, It has been that way for years and years.
[08:20] <JoshH99> rwp: Hmmm. I don't remember that being the case and almost all docs I find on the i-net say that, but ok :)
[08:20] <rwp> Basically they keep an apache.conf so that people who come from upstream apache installations via tar.gz will have what they are comfortable with.
[08:20] <PK2> !GUI
[08:20] <ubottu> The graphical user interface (GUI) in Ubuntu is composed of many elements, including the !X server, a window manager, and a desktop environment such as !GNOME or !KDE (which themselves use the !GTK and !Qt toolkits respectively)
[08:20] <JoshH99> rwp: Yeah, makes sense.
[08:20] <rwp> But it is easier to put individual things into a file by itself.
[08:21] <rwp> So I have rails passenger stuff in a rails-passenger.conf file.
[08:21] <PK2> !XFCE
[08:21] <ubottu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce as the desktop environment. More info at http://www.xubuntu.org/ - To install from Ubuntu: <unconvertable> sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop <unconvertable> - Join #xubuntu for support - See also: !Ubuntu and !Xubuntu-Channels
[08:21] <nully> rwp: =P
[08:21] <PK2> !Qt
[08:21] <ubottu> the Qt toolkit (pronounced "cute"), which forms the base of !KDE, is a cross-platform C++ application framework for !CLI and !GUI applications. Install libqt4-dev and see !build to compile Qt4 applications, join #qt for development support
[08:21] <rwp> And so on with each individual area of configuration.  For me it makes it easier to keep organized.
[08:22] <cfhowlett> PK2, /msg ubottu !commandHERE          use the command to the left to send messages to yourself privately rather than flooding channel.
[08:22] <PK2> OK
[08:23] <rwp> PK2, Also I like to /query ubotty and have a private little chat session window with it.
[08:23] <Patser> Hi, does anybody know where to get libhttp-cookie-perl? None of the servers seem to have it and my system is compaining that my packages are broken...
[08:23] <PK2> ah
[08:23] <ablest1980> hi
[08:23] <PK2> Fine fine..
[08:23]  * PK2 stops flooding the chan.
[08:24] <rwp> nully, Wow you are up late!
[08:24] <ceurapee> i
[08:28] <rwp> Patser, Perhaps you mean libhttp-cookies-perl with the 's' instead?
[08:29] <Patser> rwp: Yeah I do.
[08:29]  * Patser <-- typo freak :-(
[08:29] <rwp> A second set of eyes does help sometimes.
[08:30] <Patser> Thx rwp, thank god you had your glasses on.. :P
[08:31] <Patser> maybe I need to clean mine though.
[08:32]  * rwp chuckles
[08:32] <rwp> Patser, BTW... "apt-cache search http cookie perl" is what popped out the answer.
[08:33] <Patser> Ow thx I'll try that, weird thing this though. It seems that not only ubuntu has this problem but opensuse too...
=== intx_ is now known as intx
[08:36] <Patser> rwp: None of the servers I tried give me what I want, they all seem to be not having or not willing to supply the package
[08:38] <rwp> Patser, What version of Ubuntu are you using?
[08:39] <rwp> For me apt-cache policy libhttp-cookies-perl shows 6.00-2 in Precise.
[08:39] <Patser> rwp: 14.04.1 LTS
[08:41] <tnkhanh> Hi I'm compiling with g++
[08:41] <tnkhanh> how to add more directories to include path?
[08:43] <Patser> rwp: you just gave me an idea, everything is backwards compartible right so I might be able to steal it from an earlier version and replace the dependant package libww-perl with the according version...
[08:52] <rwp> Patser, I expect that would likely work.
[08:52] <money> hi
[08:53] <money> penis
[08:53] <money> u like
[08:54] <enchilado> money: I don't think this is the channel for that.

[08:55] <money> Sorry
[08:56] <money> my ubuntu keeps making me touch him
[08:56] <Patser> rwp: Yeah but I have been looking into the dependecies and there is a whole shitload more of them connected so i dunno if I am gonna do that....
[08:57] <enchilado> money: this channel is for support, not discussion.

[09:02] <money> Its not my fault the XChat client in Ubuntu comes here by default
[09:03] <money> I felt violated
[09:03] <money> and I'm an extremely petty and vindictive person
[09:03] <enchilado> That's not our problem
[09:03] <money> yes it is clearly
[09:03] <money> not your fault  maybe
[09:04] <PK2> Well, it'll be if you install XChat from Synaptic/APT
[09:04] <PK2> XChat isn't installed on Ubuntu by default
[09:04] <money> and?

=== bob is now known as Guest18689
[09:31] <CreeLux> so quick question, i've just setup a usb flash drive with a live boot of 14.10x64 and was wondering if/how i could config the startup sequence similar to the live cd boot that loads the whole os to ram? (and still somehow keep an active persistent volume)
=== nigel is now known as Guest83704
[09:34] <ubuntu120> hi guys, do you know of a way to get a db of all russia's streets and cities?
=== gigi is now known as Guest73773
[09:36] <Guest73773> test
[09:37] <waxhead_> do I configure LVM on the boot drive?
[09:50] <azjo> one linux problem opens up the pandoras box of murphys law. sigh.
[09:56] <wafflej0ck> ubuntu120: you may want to check out osm open source mapping project
=== Guest-4314 is now known as fraytormenta
[10:02] <CreeLux> hmm, so after creating a live usb boot drive, i can see the casper persistent volume but anything i copied to the root of the flash drive i cant find... any way to access that?
[10:07] <azjo> whats an app equivalent to unzip?
[10:07] <azjo> program*
[10:07] <wafflej0ck> CreeLux: try lsblk to see where things are mounted
[10:07] <wafflej0ck> azjo: file roller if you want a gui for unzipping?
[10:08] <wafflej0ck> azjo: should be built in already though don't think you need to install it
[10:09] <azjo> i have to extract an .img file but ubuntu says theres no program for ir
[10:09] <azjo> it
[10:10] <wafflej0ck> azjo: typically .img files aren't actually compressed they're just a block by block copy of some filesystem or something like an iso file
[10:10] <wafflej0ck> azjo: what's the file in particular? like where did the .img file come from?
[10:11] <CreeLux> oh, yep, there it is
[10:11] <KlausedSource> azjo, use dd to "extract" it onto a filesystem
[10:11] <azjo> its pidora for rpi
[10:11] <wafflej0ck> azjo: yeah typically with raspi stuff you dd it to the device
[10:11] <CreeLux> any advice on configuring this to load to ram on boot to speed things up a bit?
[10:11] <azjo> im in the process of doing a dd: http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Pidora_Installation
[10:12] <azjo> so how do i extract this .img ?
[10:12] <KlausedSource> azjo, you need to format your sd card first if you haven't
[10:12] <azjo> i have
[10:12] <wafflej0ck> azjo: dd if=NameOfImageFile of=/dev/DeviceNode bs=4M
[10:13] <KlausedSource> what is the name of your sdcard in linux?
[10:13] <wafflej0ck> azjo: instructions from the link you posted, no need to preprocess the img file typically
[10:14] <KlausedSource> azjo, if you don't know the name you can type "lsblk" (without quotes) and identify it
[10:14] <wafflej0ck> azjo: just make sure you get the if and of parameters correct (input for if should be the img file, of should be the target disk, use sudo fdisk -l, or lsblk to see the device name make sure not to target the wrong disk)
[10:14] <cristian_c> Hi
[10:14] <azjo> i just put the sd in.. when i click that, it says SETTINGS
[10:14] <azjo> is that normal?
[10:15] <cristian_c> I've installed guest additions via 'additional drivers' in a guest machine (virtualbox)
[10:15] <azjo> nvm, its cos of the NOOBS prog
[10:15] <wafflej0ck> azjo: yeah not sure about that, I'm using Ubuntu Gnome though too so things are a bit different
[10:15] <cristian_c> but I don't know how to remove them. Deactivating that option is not enough
[10:15] <cristian_c> Any ideas?
[10:16] <azjo> wow. my sd card is suddenly 776mb??
[10:16] <wafflej0ck> azjo: would use gparted to check out and format the SD card if need be
[10:17] <azjo> im in w7 now
[10:18] <wafflej0ck> cristian_c: you may want to try to run this in a terminal, dpkg-log-summary
[10:18] <cristian_c> ok
[10:18] <cristian_c> wafflej0ck, thanks
[10:18] <wafflej0ck> cristian_c: if you can locate the packages you installed with the additional drivers panel you can use apt-get purge to remove them like, sudo apt-get purge package
[10:18] <wafflej0ck> cristian_c: np perhaps someone else has a better solution but that's my best guess
[10:18] <cristian_c> wafflej0ck, ok, I understand
[10:18] <azjo> omg. i cant shrink or remove the first partition in windows. what the??
[10:19] <stobix> In upgrading from 13.10, I suddenly find myself on a non-x-capable system. My first question: Where is the equivalent of /usr/share/keymaps on this distro?
[10:19] <azjo> nvm, ignore me
[10:19] <cristian_c> wafflej0ck, but I don't know because 'additional drivers' doesn't let to uninstall guest addtions properly
[10:19] <cristian_c> -to
[10:20] <usrmaquina> hola
[10:20] <azjo> why did noobs create these partitions??
[10:20] <usrmaquina> hola
[10:20] <wafflej0ck> cristian_c: yeah I haven't actually seen that problem directly, only used additional drivers for GPU related stuff myself, in some cases with debugging/testing various graphics drivers I've had to clean up using lsmod and related mod-probe commands to unload certain modules
[10:22] <cristian_c> wafflej0ck, I think that graphics drivers can be installed and uninstalled correctly via 'Additional drivers'
[10:22] <cristian_c> I'm not sure 100%
[10:22] <cristian_c> :)
[10:22] <wafflej0ck> cristian_c: yeah in most cases it's worked fine for me for installing/uninstalling just in some edge cases with old hardware I've ended up in bad scenarios
[10:23] <cristian_c> uhm, strange
[10:23] <sasasa> Ciao a tutti :D
[10:23] <sasasa> Ciaoooooooo :>
[10:23] <cristian_c> wafflej0ck, thanks for the support :)
[10:23] <wafflej0ck> cristian_c: np, let me know how it goes
[10:24] <cristian_c> wafflej0ck, ok
[10:24] <azjo> i got gparted now. how do i sort these partitions so there is only 1?
[10:24] <cristian_c> if I see you, I'll told
[10:26] <azjo> i managed to delete all partitions. now gparted claims that my 2gb sd is only 1gb?!
[10:26] <cfhowlett> azjo, 2gb SD?  what??? 2 GB?
[10:27] <azjo> 2 GB sd card yeah
[10:27] <cfhowlett> azjo,  not sure ubuntu will fit on a 2 gb space.  lubuntu maybe ...
[10:28] <wafflej0ck> cfhowlett: it's a raspberry pi related thing
[10:28] <azjo> fuck me. i did all the edits on sda
[10:28] <cfhowlett> wafflej0ck, ah!  OK, I'm going to lurk
[10:28] <wafflej0ck> cfhowlett: just trying to load up an .img file onto an SD card for use in a raspi
[10:28] <cfhowlett> azjo, language!
[10:28] <azjo> lol sry
[10:28] <wafflej0ck> azjo: if you didn't apply yet you should be okay
[10:29] <stobix> Hm. I have an 860M nvidia card I'm trying to get to work. Is nvidia-prime something I ought to install?
[10:29] <azjo> i did apply
[10:29] <azjo> but dont worry, its just a virtual one
[10:29] <wafflej0ck> azjo: ah good to hear
[10:29] <azjo> when i got what i wanted, itll be gone
[10:30] <wafflej0ck> stobix: typically using the Additional Drivers panel is the easiest and cleanest way to install/remove drivers
[10:30] <azjo> its not wise to do these things when you are tired but i have to sort this out before im going for holidays ;D
[10:31] <wafflej0ck> azjo: heh indeed, dd can be a dangerous tool with sleepy eyes
[10:31] <wafflej0ck> same with gparted
[10:31] <azjo> what was the command for the dd?
[10:31] <stobix> wafflej0ck: Well, I seriously doubt that has a cli mode. ;) I won't have any X until I get my drivers fixed.
[10:32] <wafflej0ck> stobix: ah okay, have you tried nomodeset?
[10:32] <wafflej0ck> stobix: when you boot do you have a grub menu?
[10:32] <wafflej0ck> azjo: dd if=NameOfImageFile of=/dev/DeviceNode bs=4M
[10:32] <stobix> wafflej0ck: oh. No. Someone said something about that yesterday. Yes, I do. I'll go look at menu.lst to see how it is set up.
[10:33]  * stobix totally forgot about that.
=== CyberJacob|Away is now known as CyberJacob
[10:33] <wafflej0ck> stobix: when you boot you can hit e to edit the entry
[10:33] <wafflej0ck> stobix: then replace quiet with nomodeset
[10:33] <wafflej0ck> stobix: then ctrl+x to boot I think
[10:33] <stobix> wafflej0ck: what does nomodeset do?
[10:33] <wafflej0ck> stobix: basically fallback to basic drivers from what I understand
[10:34] <wafflej0ck> stobix: typically gets you X without all the bells and whistles like safemode for X sort of
[10:34] <wafflej0ck> !nomodeset | stobix
[10:34] <ubottu> stobix: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[10:34] <azjo> how do i get my term to desktop?
[10:34] <stobix> ah. So, basically, a "fail-safe" mode?
[10:35] <wafflej0ck> stobix: yeah essentially fail-safe for the graphics drivers, not sure if it applies to anything else
[10:35] <azjo> it says no such file or directory
[10:35] <azjo> file is on desktop
[10:35] <stobix> wafflej0ck: so this is basically to get me into X and let the graphical automagicness possibly fix the problem?
[10:36] <wafflej0ck> stobix: yeah this will just get you into X then can try the additional drivers panel, if that doesn't work out you probably want to install one of the nvidia packages for the drivers
[10:37] <wafflej0ck> azjo: are you sure you didn't wipe it out in gparted? you should be able to go to cd ~/Desktop
[10:38] <azjo> it says /home/username/desktop No such file or directory
[10:38] <wafflej0ck> uppercase D for desktop?
[10:38] <HerroWorlds> @azjo did you change username to your username?
[10:39] <azjo> i changed it to upper D
[10:39] <stobix> Huh, cute. Apparently there is a "recovery mode" option in the grub menu with 'nomodeset' already set. It also has the 'recovery' flag set - will this generate any problems?
[10:40] <azjo> hmm, by devidenode do u mean for example sda2?
[10:40] <wafflej0ck> stobix: hmm yeah not familiar with that would google but probably no reason to worry if they provide the option it probably doesn't break things
[10:41] <stobix> wafflej0ck: Well. Probably. Or it will destroy my /home and windows partition. One never knows these days.
[10:42] <cfhowlett> stobix, good thing you got those backed up already ...
[10:42] <azjo> dd if=NameOfImageFile of=/dev/sdb bs=4M <-- this would be correct?
[10:42] <azjo> the sdb
[10:42] <stobix> cfhowlett: good thing I had a spare 1TiB disc in my back pocket.
[10:43] <cfhowlett> stobix, yeah thats' ... 1 TB disc?  details!  plz.
[10:43] <zubnola> Hi.  I'm trying to remap capslock => CTRL but this graphical issue in gnome tweak tool is preventing me from following directions I've read: http://pix.toile-libre.org/?img=1419158335.png
[10:43] <wafflej0ck> stobix: heh yeah https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode looks like it's just a minimal command line interface for recovering things so you probably just want the regular entry with nomodeset
[10:44] <wafflej0ck> azjo: looks fine from here assuming /dev/sdb is the SD card and NameOfImageFile is the .img file
[10:44] <azjo> oh my cmd works now. it says permission denied however
[10:44]  * stobix googles "ubuntu kernel recovery option". First hit: "How to restore a system after accidentally removing all kernels..."
[10:45] <wafflej0ck> azjo: also note it may take like 10-15-20 minutes, use sudo
[10:45] <azjo> i just add sudo in front?
[10:45] <wafflej0ck> azjo: yeah
[10:45] <stobix> wafflej0ck: ah. Yeah, that's basically what I have now. Thanks!
[10:45]  * stobix reboots and tries it out.
[10:45] <azjo> seems to be working. now its just blinking
[10:46] <wafflej0ck> azjo: yeah now the wait begins :P
[10:46] <azjo> 20 mins u say? im gonna go outside. god my head is pounding ;(
[10:46] <azjo> and then i can just put it on my rpi, and it will boot up?
[10:47] <wafflej0ck> azjo: yeah sometimes faster sometimes slower depending on the image and disk but that's been round about how long it takes for stuff I've done with RasPi, should be all good after that like you say

[11:05]  * stobix would like to as well.
[11:06] <stobix> Maybe someone could figure out what is wrong instead?
[11:06]  * cfhowlett uses ONLY LTS
[11:06] <stobix> The relevant dmesg lines: (all 2 of them)
[11:06] <stobix> [  326.520500] ACPI Warning: \_SB_.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP._DSM: Argument #4 type mismatch - Found [Buffer], ACPI requires [Package] (20131115/nsarguments-95)
[11:06] <stobix> [  326.680710] vgaarb: this pci device is not a vga device
[11:06] <tnkhanh> how to do those "uses ONLY LTS" thing
[11:07] <cfhowlett> tnkhanh, install LTS.  upgrade regularly.  at the next LTS in 2 years, upgrade.  = "LTS only" system
[11:07] <tnkhanh> oh interesting
[11:07] <stobix> cfhowlett: s/upgrade/update ? :)
[11:07] <tnkhanh> what is the diff between LTS and non-LTS
[11:08] <cfhowlett> !LTS | tnkhanh
[11:08] <ubottu> tnkhanh: LTS means Long Term Support. Until 12.04 LTS versions of Ubuntu were supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; since 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) LTS versions will be supported for 5 years on the desktop and server. The latest LTS version of Ubuntu is !Trusty (Trusty Tahr 14.04)
[11:08] <stobix> tnkhanh: Sitting here without X because you forgot to upgrade in time.
[11:08] <Kartagis> how do I find out what binary a package provides?
[11:08] <wafflej0ck> tnkhanh: basically LTS gets security updates and the repos are maintained for packages for longer
[11:08] <wafflej0ck> Kartagis: if you have a package installed you can use dpkg -L packagename
[11:09] <tnkhanh> wafflej0ck: cfhowlett: so basically it's just longer support? :-/
[11:09] <wafflej0ck> Kartagis: it'll show all the files in the package that ended up on your system
[11:09] <wafflej0ck> tnkhanh: yeah longer support/more stable
[11:09] <tnkhanh> and in 2 years all versions are LTS?
[11:10] <wafflej0ck> tnkhanh: typically more changes in the .10 versions in October and stable versions every 2 years in april
[11:10] <cfhowlett> tnkhanh, less bleeding / bloody edge perhaps, definitely more stable than non-LTS
[11:10] <wafflej0ck> tnkhanh: 10.04, 12.04, 14.04, first number is year, second number is month
[11:10] <tnkhanh> wafflej0ck: wow, I just realized it now. Always thought .04 is randomed
[11:10] <mbalmer> LTS is nice for commercial deployments (which we do)
[11:11] <cfhowlett> tnkhanh, current LTS schedule is new release every other year
[11:12] <tnkhanh> what does it mean to be more stable?
[11:12] <wafflej0ck> stobix: yeah not sure what's up you can try to check, lsmod | grep video
[11:12] <tnkhanh> is it like safer cause ur always supported with security updates?
[11:12] <tnkhanh> or more stable in the sense of less bug?
[11:13] <wafflej0ck> tnkhanh: tested on more systems typically and doesn't introduce large changes that might break things, bigger changes are attempted in the in between versions and when something is known to be working it's introduced into one of the LTS builds, so both
[11:13] <cfhowlett> tnkhanh, less bleeding edge = "safer" packages.
[11:13] <tnkhanh> cfhowlett: wafflej0ck: wow thanks. u guys are true teachers.
[11:14] <cfhowlett> tnkhanh, I've never regretted my LTS only policy ...
[11:14] <azjo> it has finished that dd, and i just started it up on my rpi. it says: PANIC: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(179,2)
[11:15] <stobix> HAH! Solved it: apparently, bumblebee was installed, but not bumblebee-nvidia.
[11:15] <wafflej0ck> yeah I'll play with in between versions in virtual box or whatever but run LTS for my desktop and on an AWS instance

[12:32] <Ululus> yeah, thanks for that
[12:32] <_Kai_> no problem
[12:32] <_Kai_> conky can be configured to display amazing stuff
[12:32] <_Kai_> google it up, you'll like it
[12:33] <_Kai_> there are tons of ways to use it, so I can't simply point at one source on the interwebz
[12:34] <flux242> yeah, conky+openbox is the linux samurai way.
[12:34] <_Kai_> damn right
[12:34] <_Kai_> sort of Lego for Linux maniacs :P
[12:35] <flux242> i.e for tards who aren't looking for easy ways
[12:35] <_Kai_> well, I must say that it's sometimes way more convenient to simply install gnome with a bunch of plugins
[12:36] <_Kai_> but yeah, nothing can beat your own setup

[13:36] <BWorld> What could be the reason my terminal freezes over ssh after some idle time? It is really annoying and I can't remember what I did else on the other servers I am running where this never happens

[13:39] <BWorld> nrdb, yes, because whenever I open a new terminal tab I can ssh right in again
[13:39] <EriC^^> MonkeyDust: i have base64 but cl-base64 isn't installed
[13:40] <BWorld> nrdb: I already tried adding: ServerAliveInterval 2400 but this line is nowhere else in my ssh config (~/.ssh/config) and still I never lose connections to those other servers.

[13:43] <nrdb> BWorld, the only time I have trouble with the typing etc. is when the link has trouble between the two computers... how about trying doing a ping in another terminal while you use ssh as well... sorry I can't be more help.

[13:47] <kahrl> BWorld: is the server behind a NAT?
[13:47] <kahrl> NAT forgets about connections if they haven't been active for a while
[13:47] <Joe-e19> NSA?? WOW
[13:48] <BWorld> kahrl: Maybe I dont understand your question but it is a public server
[13:48] <BWorld> kahrl: I can connect and do my stuff as long as I dont idle for X minutes
[13:48] <kahrl> BWorld: perhaps the NAT is on your end?
[13:48] <BWorld> So I think it is some timeout setting or something
[13:48] <kahrl> e.g. a SOHO router
[13:49] <BWorld> I dont have this issue with other servers, only this one
[13:49] <BWorld> I guess it is some server side setting (it is a vps)
[13:49] <kahrl> could be
[13:49] <BWorld> And I was hoping someone would know what setting / direction to look for
[13:49] <kahrl> well ServerAliveInterval should fix it
[13:50] <kahrl> as long as you set it lower than the timeout in your NAT
[13:50] <BWorld> Yes, I will do that kahrl

[15:38] <OerHeks> Guest15576, sounds like a ACPI issue, maybe bios setting, or the use of nomodeset with nvidia can cause that
[15:39] <BluesKaj_> than without member support  rather , Rafayel

[16:01] <sinau> Ooooh
[16:03] <sinau> So it's better to buy a new HDD instead of taking time on resizing partitions of the current one

[16:03] <cfhowlett> sinau, it's called "disaster planning"
[16:04] <Chuck_Norris> sinau: yeah, the best thing when you start experiencing hdd issues is to back up all your data, buy a new hdd and end of story
[16:05] <Bleakwise> i'd suggest you buy a WD Black drive
[16:06] <sinau> Chuck_Norris, The main question: Can I have all data on previous HDD on the new one too?
[16:06] <sinau> I have a Win and an Ubuntu with many many software installed. And many configurations
[16:06] <sinau> Reinstalling them both will make a lot of time from me
[16:07] <Bleakwise> there are softwares that will "mirror" one drive to another
[16:07] <Chuck_Norris> sinau: yes you can, till you can read the damaged hdd and till the new hdd has at least same capacity than the old one
[16:07] <sinau> Chuck_Norris, Using gparted?
[16:07] <Bleakwise> i don' tknow what the good ones are anymore, norton ghost used to be good but i don't think it's even developed anymore
[16:08] <bekks> You dont take backups using gparted.
[16:08] <cfhowlett> !clone | sinau
[16:08] <ubottu> sinau: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can use the !software package "apt-clone" - See also !automate
[16:09] <sinau> I don't want to reinstall. It takes a lot of time, internet bandwidth, etc
[16:09] <bekks> So take a backup then, no need for using gparted :)
[16:10] <sinau> bekks, With what?
[16:10] <bekks> !backup | sinau

[16:34] <ardian> ruby was never pre-isntalled
[16:34] <ardian> Maybe some vmware feature

[17:11] <cfhowlett> jozefk, ask a midori or java channel for support of their products
[17:12] <mirak> hello
[17:12] <jozefk> yeah, on Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit

[17:14] <cfhowlett> mirak, paste the output of  cat /etc/issue
[17:14] <EriC^^> mirak: ok, we're trying to see why not, play ball
[17:14] <ProfessorKaos64> mirak, just about every install I have of late had it installed...
[17:14] <EriC^^> mirak: type "which locate"
[17:14] <mirak> EriC^^, it returns nothing. wich is te reason why I asked the question the first place
[17:15] <Blaster> How do you diagnose the reason Ubuntu 14.10 keeps freezing?
[17:15] <EriC^^> mirak: ok, type echo $PATH
[17:15] <cfhowlett> mirak, paste the output of  cat /etc/issue

[17:16] <mohcine> ubuntu mate
[17:16] <EriC^^> mirak: ok type apt-cache policy mlocate
[17:16] <bubbasaures> Blaster, depends on on what seems to be the issue, hardware, or software.....etc.
[17:16] <EriC^^> mirak: does it say it's installed?
[17:16] <mirak> EriC^^, can I  paste 5 lines ?
[17:16] <mirak> mlocate:
[17:16] <mirak>   Installed: (none)
[17:16] <mirak>   Candidate: 0.26-1ubuntu1
[17:16] <mirak>   Version table:
[17:16] <mirak>      0.26-1ubuntu1 0
[17:16] <unopaste> mirak you have been muted for 60 seconds as it looks like you are pasting lots of lines into the channel, please use http://paste.ubuntu.com and paste just the URL of your data here when you are unmuted
[17:17] <EriC^^> no just the installed line
[17:17] <cfhowlett> mirak, use fpaste.org or pastebinit
[17:17] <EriC^^> mirak: ok, that should be installed by default
[17:17] <EriC^^> mirak: sudo apt-get install mlocate
[17:17] <EriC^^> mirak: is it a fresh install?
[17:18] <mohcine> <ubottu> I have a problem in the heat high on my laptop and also the problem of the definition graphics card nvidia Geforce Gt 520M
[17:18] <mirak> hello
[17:19] <mirak> EriC^^, yes it's fresh
[17:19] <EriC^^> mirak: ok, no ppa's added etc?
[17:19] <mirak> EriC^^, i noticed that since some release
[17:19] <mirak> EriC^^, there was
[17:19] <mirak> but I have another fresh install I can check
[17:19] <b100s> so, i have question how can i install old package version ?
[17:19] <mirak> but I am pretty sure they removed it
[17:19] <bubbasaures> Blaster, Give us some details if you think it might help. ;)
[17:19] <EriC^^> mirak: was the iso checksummed ?
[17:20] <Blaster> I have no details, it just happens sometimes...
[17:20] <mirak> EriC^^, a debootstrap install, no iso
[17:20] <b100s> for example i want to install php 5.3.29, but current package php5 is php 5.5.x if i'm right
[17:20] <bubbasaures> Blaster, Have you checked if it is swapping?
[17:20] <Blaster> bubbasaures:  One of my VM is low on disk space without swap, but my host OS has plenty of disk space.
