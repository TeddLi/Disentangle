[00:25] <sixofour> it sure did help
[00:26] <SuperMiguel> ok if i type this: sensors -u | grep -w 'temp1_input' | tail -1 i get: temp1_input: 38.00 how can i remove the "temp1_input" for it to only print the 38.00 ??
[00:26] <pdg1> Desagas, aqua makes it sound like a mac theme

[00:26] <Desagas> I have a feeling I shouldn't of
[00:26] <sixofour> lol
[00:26] <genii> sixofour: I mean the -rt kernel doesn't help with keeping the cpu cool :)
[00:26] <sixofour> oh
[00:26] <sixofour> but does the rt kernal make the cpu hotter?

[00:29] <sixofour> i'ma go clean my laptop see what happens
[00:29] <sixofour> yes
[00:29] <Desagas> Pretty much random sites, yes, but none questionable in the view of virus ridden types.
[00:29] <sixofour> it is genii

[00:29] <und3rgr0undz3r0> I have a Dell Studio 1537 laptop, and the cam doesnt work, suggestions?
[00:29] <sixofour> i installed ubuntu with kde a month ago, watched on average 2 dvds a day for a few weeks, never overheated once

[00:30] <sixofour> i tried windows, networking didn't work, so went back to ubuntu with gnome, now the laptop overheats
[00:30] <pdg1> Desagas, yeah, I'm sure none of these things are actually harmful...
[00:30] <pdg1> Desagas, any idea which forum it could have come from?
[00:30] <genii> sixofour: My best guess is under normal use with usual kernel scheduling it doesn't overheat but kernel scheduling on -rt maybe killing it
[00:30] <sixofour> not sure if it matters, but the laptop is in use and on about oh... from 8am to 11pm
[00:31] <sixofour> every day..lol
[00:31] <Desagas> pdgl to be quite honest, no, I couldn't tell you from the top of my head. But I think it was when I was looking over a handful of wallpaper/design your own theme sort of things
[00:31] <sixofour> so you think i should first try a normal kernal and see if it overheats?
[00:31] <Declination> genii:
[00:31] <asgw> Zesturian: Okay, just pasted that, and did a 'service gdm restart' - now primary monitor is blank.
[00:31] <sixofour> ps. it doesn't overheat when making music1
[00:31] <Declination> genii: the kernel scheduler shouldn't make that much of a difference
[00:31] <asgw> Will restart in text-only mode and restore my xorg.conf.
[00:32] <Zesturian> asgw, Control - Alt F2
[00:32] <pdg1> Desagas, yeah, because aqua is def the name for the mac OSX theme
[00:32] <Zesturian> Control Alt F7 to get x back
[00:32] <asgw> Zesturian = as a side effect of the EDID 'hack' ctrl+alt+functions don't work.
[00:32] <Zesturian> asgw, before you do it, check /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[00:32] <Zesturian> Ouch :p

[00:37] <Chaorain> foul_owl: checkout Blender, I'm not familiar with Rihno3d though
[00:38] <DarthPuff> does ubuntu automatically clean out its archives after installs
[00:38] <th3Xfagtr> ok.. is that in the repository?
[00:38] <DarthPuff> or do i have to do that manually?
[00:38] <genii> sixofour: With grub 1, ESC key, with grub2, shift key
[00:38] <merma> th3Xfagtr, yep
[00:38] <hunahpu> th3Xfagtr: Rhythmbox is similar to iTunes, is already installed in your Ubuntu system; other options are Banshee, Amarok and Songbird (which looks just like iTunes)
[00:38] <th3Xfagtr> cool
[00:38] <foul_owl> i do like blender
[00:38] <foul_owl> but any other options?
[00:38] <sixofour> just mash the shift or esc key?

[00:39] <amos81> und3rgr0undz3r0: ur cam should work now
[00:39] <Desagas> pdgl thank you, I appreciate it, I can't seem to find anything to help

[00:39] <asgw> Thanks for the help.
[00:39] <asgw> I don't like giving up on problems though.
[00:40] <asgw> So am going to continue trying to get the damn second display to work.
[00:40] <Zesturian> No problem, likewise, bit tricky without hands on, might be worth a bug report if you can isolate it.
[00:40] <Zesturian> Are you sure it wasn't using 'vesa' when you used live cd?
[00:40] <und3rgr0undz3r0> asmos81 both skype and facebook still don't see the cam
[00:41] <pdg1> Desagas, I'm assuming 9.10
[00:41] <Desagas> pdgl Yep
[00:41] <Zesturian> Try the xorg.conf.failsafe, you might find it clones it then
[00:42] <amos81> und3rgr0undz3r0: have you checked the webcam options in skype?
[00:42] <SuperMiguel> when you add a start up program using the startup aplications preferences is there a way to make it so the startup program will be ran as root?
[00:42] <und3rgr0undz3r0> asmos81 yes it doesnt show me any options for a cam
[00:42] <pdg1> Desagas, gnome? not fluxbox, kde, xfce, etc... ?
[00:42] <asgw> Zesturian: It was using whatever was default, I guess.
[00:42] <Desagas> pdgl Uhh, I have no idea to be honest, how do I tell?
[00:42] <asgw> Certainly it wasn't nvidia though.
[00:42] <sixofour> ok, using the generic kernal now...lets see what can i test this out on
[00:42] <hunahpu> SuperMiguel: not unless you log in as root
[00:43] <fabiobik> hello im using slitaz in startx how to run terminal?
[00:43] <fabiobik> anyone know?
[00:43] <Zesturian> asgw, yeah, that would be vesa, that's likely to clone, try the failsafe (backup your current one though), see if that does what you experienced in live cd
[00:43] <xangua> this is #ubuntu, not #slitaz fabiobik
[00:43] <SuperMiguel> hunahpu, is there a way to start something as root?
[00:43] <sixofour> usualy when i tried to render an mpeg2 in kdenlive, my laptop would die in about oh 15 minutes
[00:43] <fabiobik> xangua i can read
[00:43] <amos81> und3rgr0undz3r0: there is an option called video in skype
[00:43] <amos81> und3rgr0undz3r0: you can select and try your cam there
[00:43] <pdg1> Desagas, well if you just installed ubuntu and not Kubuntu and not Xubuntu... safe to say you've got gnome... changing guis isn't something you can do by accident
[00:44] <5EXAANIBG> hello all.   Would like to know where I might find the config for ubuntu 9.x's fiile sharing (smb.conf?). Have already looked for smb.conf but the only one I find starts with a comment saying it is a sample.
[00:44] <fabiobik> xangua the problem is dont have someone to help there
[00:44] <und3rgr0undz3r0> asmos81 yes it dosesnt show my cam in the selection.
[00:44] <Desagas> pdgl, then I can safely assume i'm using Gnome
[00:44] <hunahpu> SuperMiguel: yeah press Alt+F2 and type "gksu <yourgraphicprogram>" or "sudo <nongraphicprogram>"; you can also launch them from command line of course.
[00:44] <pdg1> Desagas, unless you're really talented in having accidents
[00:44] <asgw> It was better than mirrored I think, they were initially mirrored, but via the display preferences managed to enable separate outputs.
[00:44] <und3rgr0undz3r0> asmos81 there is no cams to select there
[00:44] <xangua> fabiobik: those are the rules ;) sorry :(

[00:47] <Zesturian> strange asgw, well the obvious answer might be to copy the xorg.conf from the live disc and give that a whirl.

Installed 10.04 everything works great right out of the box except you need to uninstall pulse audio and install ALSA Mixer. After that your mic will work including skype. Except that no changes neccessary. function keys, sleep, hibernate, all work.
[00:53] <asgw> okay, no worries, thanks for the help.

[00:54] <pdg1> Desagas, if you open a program ( gedit or something)
[00:54] <asgw> just no 3d support
[00:54] <asgw> i bet i can add that back in now though...
[00:54] <Desagas> pdgl, what would you like me to do in it?
[00:55] <keenan> if someone can put the Gateway 2104u netbook up on tier 1 that would be swell
[00:55] <pdg1> Desagas, and then you right click the top panel of that programs window... does it show something like " move to" and from there you can select workspace right/left?
[00:55] <Desagas> pdgl, yep, that moved it to the right workspace when I told it to
[00:56] <pdg1> Desagas, now... i'm guessing you can see it in the little workspace window thing down at the bottom?
[00:57] <Desagas> pdgl, I can, I can see theres a box in there but clicking on it doesn't move me to that workspace
[00:57] <Desagas> pdgl, but yes, its there
[00:57] <pdg1> Desagas, can you alt+tab to it?

[00:59] <craniumslows> pdg1, like you didnt redifine your preferences to have only 1 row and 1 column did you?
[00:59] <craniumslows> pdg1, i know its a silly question but some times people do that
[00:59] <Desagas> craniumslow not sure exactly what you're asking?
[00:59] <und3rgr0undz3r0> asmos81 I have no idea where i'm going wrong with this
[01:00] <und3rgr0undz3r0> asmos81 is there a way to get webcams working in a VM?
[01:00] <craniumslows> In the Workplace Switcher Preferences you can define a number of columns and rows. If you defined both to 1 then you wouldn't have anything to switch to
[01:00] <Desagas> says 5 Columns and 1 row, how I normally have it
[01:00] <stopsign> und3rgr0undz3r0: just plug it in before u start the vm
[01:01] <Desagas> its like they exist and work but I just can't get to them
[01:01] <und3rgr0undz3r0> stopsign its integrated in my laptop
[01:01] <stopsign> it should show uo as a usb devise
[01:01] <mustangg> where does the correct smb.conf live in an install of jaunty, when file/folder sharing is enabled...?
[01:01] <und3rgr0undz3r0> where?
[01:01] <pdg1> craniumslows, yeah, i didn't do anything... it's Desagas
[01:01] <jrib> mustangg: /etc/samba/smb.conf probably
[01:02] <stopsign> you using virtual box?
[01:02] <und3rgr0undz3r0> stopsign, yes, but im thinking about switching to VMware
[01:02] <Desagas> craniumslows, hes right. Its my stuff not working. Still got no idea what I did either which is worse
[01:02] <ZykoticK9> und3rgr0undz3r0, specifically are you using the VirtualBox direct from Oracle or the one from the Ubuntu repo?
[01:02] <stopsign> look under your usb settings
[01:02] <Desagas> could Ubuntu Tweak mess with it?
[01:03] <djbeenie_> ok whats up with firefox 3.6..it keeps freezing on me
[01:03] <stopsign> you need the non-free version for usb support
[01:03] <craniumslows> Desagas, can you send apps to different workspaces / move to diff spaces with ctrl+alt+up arrow?
[01:03] <mustangg> jrib - got one copy there, but also a few interesting ones in /usr/share/samba as well.  ie: smb.conf, smb.conf.gutsy
[01:04] <jrib> mustangg: I don't know what those do, but what you want to edit is definitely the one in /etc/
[01:04] <und3rgr0undz3r0> stopsign, where can I get the non-free version?
[01:04] <glphvgacs> http://paste.ubuntu.com/412831/
[01:04] <Desagas> craniumslows, I can send open windows across to left/right workspace but can't get to those workspaces in anyway. ctrl+alt+up/left/right doesn't do anything
[01:04] <stopsign> hold on a sec
[01:04] <ZykoticK9> und3rgr0undz3r0, http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
[01:04] <craniumslows> Desagas, do you have Compiz/Fusion kicking?
[01:05] <Desagas> craniumslows, Compiz I believe
[01:05] <mustangg> jrib - thanks.
[01:05] <stopsign> und3rgr0undz3r0: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
[01:05] <supermatt1000> i have my computer set up with twin veiw and they seam indepentint from one another but when i go to run a program on the other monitor its on both monitors and i only want it full screen on the one
[01:05] <craniumslows> Desagas, have you been mucking about with those settings lately? CompizConfig settings manager?
[01:05] <Desagas> craniumslows, ...maybe
[01:06] <Desagas> craniumslows, I have a feeling this'll be another case of "I messed with something I shouldn't of" again
[01:06] <und3rgr0undz3r0> thanks yo
[01:06] <djbeenie_> can someone help me with firefox, I cant do any searching because it keeps freezing on me
[01:06] <craniumslows> Desagas, Something I've learned over time is that it's usually easier to fix something broken than to go nuclear and reinstall
[01:06] <craniumslows> I <3 Links when firefox poops on my head
[01:07] <craniumslows> Desagas, If you messed around with the key bindings you might have overridden somet hings is this problem consistent across reboot?
[01:07] <Desagas> craniumslows, i'm not a reinstall type of guy so that works out, I can't find any options in compizconfig that would mess with it that I know about. I know I didn't mess with keybindings
[01:08] <djbeenie_> is there a better browser to work with in ubuntu...i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, uninstalled all plugins, but still keep having freezes
[01:08] <craniumslows> Desagas, do you have the cube setup??
[01:08] <Chaorain> can someone tell me how to use modprobe to get my sound card back?
[01:08] <Desagas> craniumslows, Uh, I want to say no? But honestly not sure what you're talking about
[01:08] <craniumslows> djbeenie_, you can try alot of diff ones epiphany works for me
[01:08] <xangua> !better > djbeenie_
[01:08] <ubottu> djbeenie_, please see my private message
[01:08] <xangua> !browser | djbeenie_
[01:08] <ubottu> djbeenie_: Browsers available for Ubuntu: Firefox (GTK, Gecko engine), Konqueror (KDE/Qt, KHTML engine), Epiphany (GTK, Gecko engine), Dillo (GTK), w3m (terminal-based), Links2 (terminal-based or graphical, see !man page), edbrowse (command-line), Opera (Qt, proprietary)
[01:09] <xangua> and also chromium and opera ;)
[01:09] <xangua> mmm midori doesn't appear either
[01:09] <craniumslows> Desagas, Under desktop there is "Desktop Cube" and "Rotate Cube" these are common but not always on
[01:10] <Cornwall> Midori is a good little browser :)
[01:10] <Desagas> craniumslows, neither option is checked
[01:10] <craniumslows> Desagas, alrighty then lets sit on our thinking buckets
[01:10] <djbeenie_> how can i roll back the latest firefox patch..it was working fire before this morning patch
[01:11] <Desagas> craniumslows, sounds good
=== lilbeanski is now known as lucretiaX
[01:11] <djbeenie_> heck i cant even search on installing opera...
[01:12] <fiber> hello.... I was wondering if there was an easy way to start a script every time a CD is inserted into the drive (and I want this to run even if no user is logged in)
[01:12] <frodo> What is the best/easiest way to share files between Ubuntu machines?  NFS? SSH?  Is there a way to map a remote directory to look like a drive like you can do in Windows?  Thanks.
[01:12] <jiohdi> frodo: dropbox
[01:12] <jiohdi> :)
[01:12] <xangua> djbeenie_: you can install opera from the repositories i believe
[01:12] <craniumslows> frodo, you could also right click and just say share
[01:13] <craniumslows> frodo, in nautilus that is
[01:13] <asgw> frodo - 'ubuntu one'
[01:13] <asgw> or samba
[01:13] <fiber> frodo: if many people are on the network, sftp.... if not use NFS or SAMBA.... you can view people on the network with places->network and open a share with places->connect to server (i'm on 9.04)
[01:13] <craniumslows> Desagas, ok so the forums pretty much have people having the same "problem" but the solutions are all over the place
[01:13] <jiohdi> dropbox seems to work better than ubuntu one and works on windows too
[01:13] <Desagas> craniumslows, so start with the easiest and move forward from there?
[01:14] <craniumslows> Desagas, Do you have an accelerated 3d graphics card?
[01:14] <chibihogoshino> how would i go back to a older kernel version if the new one wont let me boot ?
[01:14] <craniumslows> chibihogoshino, did you custom compile?
[01:15] <chibihogoshino> no
[01:15] <jiohdi> chibihogoshino: on start up you usually have the option to boot into the older kernels if they are still there
[01:15] <Desagas> craniumslows, i'm not sure. Nvidia GeForce 8600 GTS
[01:15] <craniumslows> what jiohdi said
[01:15] <chibihogoshino> yeah.. i dont have any options when booting
[01:15] <craniumslows> Desagas, yeah you should be fine
[01:15] <Desagas> craniumslows and if it helps, it was working earlier today. Just stopped working after a reset
[01:15] <craniumslows> Desagas, I'd say turning on the desktop cube and the rotate cube options and seeing you can switch using the compiz manager
[01:16] <craniumslows> Desagas, also once you get compiz "just right" might want to backup that file somewhere
[01:17] <chibihogoshino> i know your supposed to hit esc to get the menu but it goes strait to booting up and hags with the usb detection .. tho if i pull a usb dev out it sees it and comes up with the removal message
[01:17] <Desagas> craniumslows, its working now, I can even click across like before
[01:17] <Desagas> craniumslows I enabled "Desktop Cube" and its working
[01:17] <craniumslows> chibihogoshino, you might boot from live cd and then mount your hard drive and move the bad kernel out and put the new one in
[01:17] <Desagas> craniumslows, Thank you! This is working as nicely as I could want it to
[01:17] <craniumslows> Desagas, W00T
[01:17] <craniumslows> Desagas, I'm glad to help
[01:17] <Desagas> craniumslows, Your help is appreciated a lot
[01:17] <craniumslows> I've been having fun helping out here in #ubuntu :)
[01:17] <martian> Is there a way to set a command alias so that it is active only in a particular directory? I want 'ls' to sort by date in a few specific diectories by default if possible.
[01:18] <poi77> Hi! I need help using python setuptools. I installed something but now I need to uninstall it. How can this be done?
[01:18] <craniumslows> martian, you typically make an alias with a diff name you dont want to over-wright the original utility
[01:18] <craniumslows> martian, you might make an lst or a lt alias maybe ? then just call when ready
[01:18] <chibihogoshino> craniumslows, i tryed that.. the new kernel is the bad one .. and when i boot from when i did that it comes up with the blue screen debien error where it has you need to load the kernel first .. press enter
[01:19] <craniumslows> chibihogoshino, do you know the location of the "good" kernel
[01:19] <chibihogoshino> craniumslows, yeah.. its in the same dir as the other one
[01:20] <craniumslows> chibihogoshino, IIRC you should be able to just issue the command boot /dev/slice/kernel
[01:20] <craniumslows> chibihogoshino, let me check
[01:20] <martian> craniumslows: yeah, I suppose that makes sense... just though it would be an interesting practice if it was possible :)
[01:20] <cheako> Hello, I have a problem getting Nautilus to ignore my BluRay drive,
[01:21] <craniumslows> martian, you *could write a script that ran pwd first and then had it take action depending but thats kind of sloppy
[01:21] <cheako> cheako@overrun:/wine$ lsof /dev/sr0
[01:21] <cheako> COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
[01:21] <cheako> nautilus 4095 cheako   60u   BLK   11,0      0t0 2536 /dev/sr0
[01:21] <FloodBot3> cheako: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[01:21] <chibihogoshino> craniumslows, from a live cd ?
[01:22] <craniumslows> chibihogoshino, You "should" be able to tell the loader where your kernel is but if you boot from live ccd you can just mount the drive and go move the file
[01:22] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: Ignore a drive? Most peple complain they dont work. What are you trying to do?
[01:22] <ta_> how can I access a network drive? I have a domain with host monster and the instructions say that I only need to type "https://yourdomain.com:2078" but when I do it, there is an error message "Access was denied"
[01:22] <chibihogoshino> craniumslows, how will grub know that to use the older kernel ?
[01:23] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: There a numerous problems.  If I could fix even one it would be progress.
[01:23] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: The tray closes if it's open.
[01:23] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: Im not sure what disabling a cd/dvd drive has to do with.
[01:23] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: This indecates a deeper problem that something is hammering the drive.
[01:23] <craniumslows> chibihogoshino, If you have grub setup then you dont need to go through all these hoops man
[01:24] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako:Do you have a more rooted problem that caused you to ask such a question?
[01:24] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: disabling?  Your word, not mine.
[01:24] <craniumslows> ta_, Where are you trying to access this drive from?
[01:24] <chibihogoshino> craniumslows, aaa  so it should auto detect the other images ?
[01:24] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: Im offering help in other words.
[01:24] <craniumslows> chibihogoshino, you should be able to press esc or shift while its booting up to get the grub menu
[01:24] <doafsaeoi> HELLO
[01:25] <craniumslows> Hi
[01:25] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: It's a change of subject.  I'd like nautils to -not- open /dev/sr0.
[01:25] <cooper[desktop]> jrib, it's automatic
[01:25] <nishanth> i turned off acpi; my sound controlling device do not work does anyone know how to fix it?
[01:25] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: Can you be more specific?
[01:25] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: The tray closes when I don't ask it to be closed.
[01:25] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: I see
[01:25] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: That is whenever the tray is open.
[01:26] <doafsaeoi> HI ARE THERE ANY BLACK NEGROES HERE
[01:26] <jrib> cooper[desktop]: ok, but please disable the changing of your nick
[01:26] <craniumslows> YAY
[01:26] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: What release version? 9.10?
[01:27] <craniumslows> Such smooth banishment
[01:27] <chibihogoshino> craniumslows, aaa thanks.. i didnt know about the holding shift down..
[01:27] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: Where do I get version?  It's karmic.
[01:27] <craniumslows> chibihogoshino, right on! you should be able to get fixed up from there w/e got screwed up
[01:27] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: Has any previous releases caused this problem?
[01:27] <chibihogoshino> craniumslows,  thanks for your help..   its working now..
[01:27] <craniumslows> chibihogoshino, 2 fer 2 woo hoo
[01:28] <chibihogoshino> craniumslows,  keep rocking
[01:28] <craniumslows> thnk
[01:28] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: Fresh install of unbuntu.  Didn't do this in Debian.
[01:28] <ta_> craniumslows, from my office
[01:28] <gsker> Using an /etc/network/interfaces configuration, I would like to have two interfaces using dhcp but only have resolv.conf udpated from one of them. How might I do that?<key:H
[01:28] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: Ill get yelled at if I talk about debian here so i wont.
[01:28] <craniumslows> ta_, Are you going to places connect to server?
[01:28] <nishanth> i turned off acpi; my sound controlling device do not work does anyone know how to fix it?
[01:28] <craniumslows> nishanth, can you turn acpi back on?
[01:29] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: And you didnt asswer my question about previous releases/
[01:29] <ta_> craniumslows, I am trying that option now
[01:29] <soreau> allrighteee THEN!!!oneone
[01:29] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: Can't is not the same as Didn't.
[01:29] <craniumslows> ta_, it should prompt you for user and pass from there
[01:29] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: Meaning 9.10 is your first ubuntu experience?
[01:30]  * craniumslows throws toast
[01:30] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: Fresh/First install of ubuntu.
[01:30] <nishanth> craniumslows: is there a way to fix it without turning acpi an?
[01:30] <nishanth> on?
[01:30] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: Ok. Perhaps you could report a bug "ubuntu-bug nautilus"?
[01:30] <craniumslows> nishanth, I dunno what is your sound cards chipset? is it detected by the os?
[01:30] <newnick> i was here earlier. same problem maybe more ppl are here.    i try to install ubuntu 9.10 netbook remix, eeebuntu 3, and ubuntu 9.10 desktop. with FAT and FAT 32 on the usb drive at different times. it boots the OS fine but when i go to install it perminately to my SSD, it crashes with errno 5 at 25% installed.. :( ?
[01:31] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009, I closed Nautilus and it's still doing it.
[01:31] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: Read above.
[01:31] <nishanth> craniumslows : no it is not detected
[01:31] <craniumslows> nishanth, ok does it show up under lspci ?
[01:31] <craniumslows> nishanth, in the terminal
[01:32] <nishanth> let me try
[01:32] <craniumslows> nishanth, alrighty
[01:32] <LinuxGuy2009> cheako: Ok. Perhaps you could report a bug "ubuntu-bug nautilus"? Good place to start. That is of course unless you havent installed up updates.
[01:32] <gsker> newnick: are you partitioning the SSD? How big is it? How big are the USB drives?
[01:33] <gsker> newnick: can you watch the install on another console to see what's in the logs?
[01:33] <nishanth> craniumslows : how do you find which is the sound chipset
[01:33] <nishanth> i typed lspci
[01:33] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: "sudo lshw -C sound"
[01:33] <JoeSomebody> probably tired of this question, when is new release out?
[01:34] <LinuxGuy2009> april 29
[01:34] <JoeSomebody> darn
[01:34] <JoeSomebody> impatient :)
[01:34] <trinikrono> you could always try the beta
[01:34] <newnick> gsker, the usb drive is 1gb. i attempted to wipe the drive completely and repartition to only ubuntu, it seems to get past that and the error is installing  the OS itself, i think.  i do not know how to watch the install in another console
[01:34] <LinuxGuy2009> JoeSomebody: Your welcome to download and test Lucid.
[01:34] <trinikrono> its beta2 now
[01:34] <JoeSomebody> beta, yes, good idea
[01:34] <nishanth> craniumslows: 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio
[01:35] <craniumslows> nishanth, is this a laptop?
[01:35] <gsker> nwnick: alt-ctrl-F1 (or F2 or F3 or wherever they are sending log msgs now.  Also, after the failed install, you might be able to mount the failed drive and look in /tmp or /var/log/install
[01:35] <nishanth> craniumslows: yes it is laptop
[01:36] <newnick> okay its going to take a good 15 mins... because lately i have been trying to put an XP image in the drive.. but i cant even figure out how to do that
[01:37] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: What was your issue again?
=== ar0n is now known as ar0nic
[01:37] <newnick> ill try to install again. should i use FAT or FAT 32 on the usb
[01:37] <JoeSomebody> anyone got a link for that beta? not seeing one on ubuntu.com
[01:37] <craniumslows> nishanth, might read or try to follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
=== IdleOne is now known as Rabbinightmare
[01:38] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009: well i turned off acpi due to some other issues but after that my laptop doesnot detect the sound controller device

[01:38] <gsker> vfat
[01:38] <newnick> ???
[01:38] <Fernandos> hi
[01:38] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: Ok so now you dont have sound?
[01:38] <craniumslows> nishanth, you probably dont have the appropriate kernel module/sound card driver
[01:38] <trinikrono> JoeSomebody:  gimme a sec
[01:38] <JoeSomebody> ok
[01:38] <gsker> How are you putting the install onto the usb drive?
[01:38] <craniumslows> nishanth, but maybe LinuxGuy2009 has some extra ideas
[01:39] <trinikrono> JoeSomebody: http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/10.04/
[01:39] <trinikrono> win!
[01:39] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009: i have sound but i can use the scroll to increase or decrease it
[01:39] <JoeSomebody> trinikrono thanks
[01:39] <nishanth> oops i can't
[01:39] <Fernandos> I have HardyHeron and it says "Couldn't find package php-apc" when I enter "sudo apt-get install php-apc".. Can you help me?
[01:39] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: You mean the panel applet?
[01:39] <newnick> in on  a windows machine now, should i use something other than windows default tool to format it? i used unetbootin and universal usbinstaller
=== Rabbinightmare is now known as IdleOne
[01:39] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009:yes
[01:39] <trinikrono> JoeSomebody: i downloaded it yesterday
[01:39] <trinikrono> have fun
[01:40] <Fernandos> I have enabled all sources in /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:40] <jrendas> I thought one file named "wedaolu" was a virus in my seven partition so I deleted it using ubuntu. I deleted and it cannot be recovered now (I tried ntfsundelete). Now I can't boot my Seven. I think the file "wedaolu" is some file created by GRUB. Could someone with dual boot (ubuntu+seven) send me wedaolu file? It is placed in C:\
[01:40] <cheako> LinuxGuy2009: This is a kernel regression.
[01:40] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009: the scrolling device to increase sound on the keyboard
[01:40] <gsker> newnick: I don't think it should matter.
[01:40] <Fernandos> and I have made an "sudo apt-get update" before
[01:40] <Flannel> jrendas: GRUB wouldn't have created that file.  You should ask ##windows for assistance with that file if it is a part of windows
[01:40] <newnick> is it perhaps a problem with my USB device? or can you not tell that explicitly til i have a log of the fail
[01:41] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: hmmm
[01:41] <gsker> Hmmm.  I don't have much experience with unetbootin, but I thought it was for installing from an already running windows environment.
[01:41] <gsker> But you say you are putting XP _back_ on the machine
[01:41] <cheako> I can't get the drive to stay open to test any of these.
[01:41] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: Wheel work for scrolling window contents etc?
[01:41] <lukus`> i'm using lucid and i like the newly placed window controls on the left
[01:41]  * lukus` is controversial
[01:41] <LinuxGuy2009> lukus`: yes so do I.
[01:41] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009 : yes
[01:41] <tm0> Hey all, how to i install UVC
[01:41] <lukus`> LinuxGuy2009; it's not too difficult to get a hang of
[01:42] <newnick> no i was trying to put xp on, cause non of the ubuntu was working.. but right now the netbook in question is empty of anything
[01:42] <snowhouse> Ok so whenever I try to play a dvd on ubuntu both vlc and movie player quit any suggestions?
[01:42] <lukus`> or _the_ hang of
[01:42] <LinuxGuy2009> lukus`: no I actually prefer it now.
[01:42] <lukus`> LinuxGuy2009; i'm a bit scared about hitting close accidently
[01:42] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009: well it is not a wheel but touch device
[01:42] <lukus`> does that happen with you?
[01:43] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: Oh so your trying to use side scrolling for volume adjustment?
[01:43] <snowhouse> help?
[01:43] <U-b-u-n-t-u> is there a good gif compressor for ubuntu?

[01:43] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009: and it does not work
[01:43] <WebDawg> how do i reinstall gnome?
[01:43] <snowhouse> no
[01:43] <snowhouse> the window just dissapears
[01:44] <gom79x> hello~
[01:44] <craniumslows> snowhouse, is this on multiple dvds or just the one?
[01:44] <craniumslows> hi
[01:44] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: Are you trying to use vertical or horiz scrolling?
[01:44] <snowhouse> i've only trie one
[01:44] <snowhouse> *tried
[01:44] <gom79x> anyone know solution to remove Xlib: extension on "RANDR"/.... when  use vnc connections.
[01:44] <U-b-u-n-t-u> thank you to both LinuxGuy2009 and MorkBork ... I have tried both I thought there might be others... can't seem to get the gifs to msn size without loosing quality
[01:44] <xangua> WebDawg: have you tried installing the metapackage ubuntu-desktop <unconvertable>
[01:44] <craniumslows> snowhouse, I'd sugest trying another dvd just to make sure its not the disc
[01:44] <MorkBork> there are others U-b-u-n-t-u
[01:44] <WebDawg> what does that do?
[01:45] <LinuxGuy2009> U-b-u-n-t-u: GIF is lossless after first compression.
[01:45] <MorkBork> in a gui environment theres phatch
[01:45] <WebDawg> i need to remove gnome
[01:45] <WebDawg> and install it again.
[01:46] <LinuxGuy2009> WebDawg: What would removing gnome accomplish for you?
[01:46] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009: it is a small touch scrolling device to control volume and it is positioned as a small flat touch device on my keyboard
[01:46] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth:Ah well that explains it.
[01:46] <WebDawg> jesus.
[01:46] <WebDawg> My taskbar is messed up.  Gnome freezes when I move panels.
[01:47] <WebDawg> I need to reinstall GNOME>
[01:47] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009: so is there a fix?
[01:47] <WebDawg> How do i do it?
[01:47] <WebDawg> how about this.
[01:47] <jrendas> does anyone know if when I delete one file using "sudo rm file" it can be recovered?
[01:47] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: If its a proprietary multimedia control on a keyboard then its a lack of driver support maybe. Tried using system->prefs->keyboard shortcuts?
[01:47] <WebDawg> how do i log out via kb shortcut?
[01:48] <LinuxGuy2009> WebDawg:  system->prefs->keyboard shortcuts lists all default shortcut keys
[01:48] <nyhcjedi> anyone having issues watching youtube?
[01:48] <nyhcjedi> no streaming vids are playing
[01:48] <snowhouse> so now it just says it can't read the disk
[01:48] <WebDawg> GNOME is frozen son.
[01:49] <snowhouse> with a diffrent disk
[01:49] <LinuxGuy2009> nyhcjedi: nope youtube working fine
[01:50] <NICK12881> hi
[01:50] <gatinois> hi nici
[01:50] <nyhcjedi> hmm
[01:50] <NICK12881> :)
[01:50] <Alcor> WebDawg ctl alt del
[01:50] <NICK12881> how are u
[01:50] <nyhcjedi> not sure what the prbolem is
=== NICK12881 is now known as RoOoMi-eXe
[01:50] <tristan__> hello
[01:50] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009: i couldn't find any way to fix it in keyboard shortcuts
[01:51] <jrendas> does anyone know if when I delete one file using "sudo rm file" it can be recovered?
[01:51] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: Then if its some sort of proprietary multimedia control on a keyboard then your probably out of luck possibly.
[01:51] <tristan__> am I in the right place for ubuntu netbook remix support? (wireless adapter not working)
[01:51] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__:  yes
[01:52] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__: "sudo lshw -C lan"
[01:52] <Alcor> jrendas NO  It cant
[01:52] <hiexpo> jrendas, its a goner
[01:52] <MorkBork> jrendas, probably, but not without some skill
[01:52] <MorkBork> jrendas, depends on the filesystem
[01:52] <jrendas> the file system is ntfs
[01:52] <Alcor> jrendas first copy to Ofilename then remove it
[01:52] <jrendas> I used ntfsundelete
[01:53] <jrendas> with no results
[01:53] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009: it says XF86AudioLower volume..... in keyboard shortcuts
[01:53] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: Ok so just set that for volume up and volume down keys?
[01:53] <insulina> hello, I my apt-get dist-upgrade, dont upgrade to karmic ?
[01:54] <insulina> \why
[01:54] <Alcor> jrendas Always copy the file to Ofilename before you do anything... Then you can copy Ofilename to filename to get back...
[01:54] <insulina> it says everything is updated
[01:54] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009 : well i think it is already set
[01:54] <paragonc> im trying to sync 2 local folders - but rsync hangs on this command rsync -a /home/jackmurphy/downloads/ /media/STORAGE/downloads/
[01:54] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth:Try clearing it out first or set it to something else random and then change back and see.
[01:55] <jrib> paragonc: adding -v any help?
[01:55] <jrendas> yes I didnt backup the file cause i thought it was a virus
[01:55] <paragonc> seems to be outpitting data
[01:55] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009 : i cant change it to anything
[01:56] <mc_> I have a question, I have my mp3 on windows partition and play them from rhythmbox when I'm in linux. In the past rhythmbox used to mount the partition to access files, but after recent updates doesn't anymore
[01:56] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: CTRL+U or something random?
[01:56] <mc_> I have changed /usr/share/polkit-l/actions.org.free..disk.policy to yes
[01:56] <mc_> still doesn't work.. any advises?
[01:57] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009 :  i set it to f2 and f3
[01:58] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: Ok now try to change it to your special keyboard controller or whatever.
[01:58] <LinuxGuy2009> nishanth: Whats the keyboard make and model BTW?
[01:58] <nishanth> LinuxGuy2009 : it is Hp
[01:59] <mc_> it works of course after I mount the partition before starting rhythmbox but it's an annoyance...
[01:59] <cheako> The sysctl command worked, but I _want_ my drive to auto close when it used too.  Is there a way I can trace who(what application) is messing with my drive?
[02:00] <paragonc> is rsync the best method for moving multiple  large files from 1 disk to another
[02:00] <GSF1200S> if X was to freeze, could I just use alt+sysrq+k, or would I have to use alt+sysrq+r first?
[02:01] <domas> hi! how can I read my partition table? parted rounds to megabytes, and I'd like to know sector/block offsets!
[02:01] <tristan__> LinuxGuy2009 : do you want to know anything from the output of that command?
[02:01] <GSF1200S> paragonc: I think so.. it works fantastic to me
[02:01] <LinuxGuy2009> paragonc: I think most non-nerds use copy and paste.
[02:01] <Iowahc> hy there, is there a way to see which HTTP Traffic is coming in to my Ubuntu Server?
[02:01] <GSF1200S> rsync is easy as hell to use
[02:01] <paragonc> ive had rsync hang on some extremely large movie files
[02:02] <Mobuntu> anybody here familiar with skype and pulse audio
[02:02] <paragonc> like 5GB +
[02:02] <LinuxGuy2009> paragonc: Ok so then dont use rsync for those.
[02:02] <GSF1200S> rsync options /data/to/backup/ /place/to/backup/to
[02:02] <GSF1200S> Mobuntu: what do you want to know?
[02:03] <RoOoMi-eXe> where can learn ubuntu terminal command on can learning more about of  shell programing
[02:03] <GSF1200S> paragonc: I have large movie files and rsync had no problem
[02:03] <LinuxGuy2009> RoOoMi-eXe: YouTube....seriously
[02:03] <Iowahc> anyone?
[02:03] <RoOoMi-eXe> or any thing about of ubuntu
[02:03] <RoOoMi-eXe> hmmm
[02:04] <GSF1200S> im sure there is
[02:04] <GSF1200S> i dont know off the top of my head
[02:04] <tristan__> sudo lshw -C lan spit out a bunch of information?
[02:04] <Mobuntu> GSF1200S I use Skype with Yealink Skype adaptor
[02:04] <paragonc> well i actually deleted that file - so hopefully this attempt @ syncing works
[02:04] <monkeytwin> anyone know what font and fontsize "pterm" uses ?
[02:04] <paragonc> its about 2 TB of data
[02:05] <Iowahc> tristan__: was this information for me?
[02:05] <Alcor> wow
[02:05] <paragonc> trying to move my media center data to a new HD
[02:05] <Iowahc> tristan__: if so, then you misunderstood, i need to monitor the incoming traffic
[02:05] <LinuxGuy2009> paragonc: Why not just Clonezilla from one drive to the other?
[02:05] <GSF1200S> Mobuntu: whats the issue you are having? I have skype running with a USB webcam+mic through pulseaudio and it works great
[02:05] <tristan__> Iowahc : sorry, it was for LinuxGuy2009
[02:06] <sakekasi> hi
[02:06] <Iowahc> ok
[02:06] <paragonc> LinuxGuy2009: i want the media to be on a seperate partition - right now user and system files are on the same partition
[02:06] <sakekasi> i have a qtn
[02:06] <sakekasi> which channel an i go to to ask a qtn about java?
[02:06] <sakekasi>  #java requires an invite
[02:07] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__: Whats for me?
[02:07] <monkeytwin> sakekasi: join ##java
[02:07] <xangua> sakekasi: requires invite or to be registered <unconvertable>

[02:07] <sakekasi> kthanx
[02:07] <paragonc> or #oracale 8)
[02:07] <tristan__> LinuxGuy2009 : I ran that command you posted, i was wondering if you wanted any of the output
[02:07] <sakekasi> who do i talk to then
[02:07] <monkeytwin>  ##java !  not #java
[02:07] <sakekasi> can i just ask here monkeytwin?
[02:08] <monkeytwin> #java is a social channel .  ##java is where you ask java questions.
[02:08] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__: Sure please visit pastebin.org and paste the link here for us.

[02:09] <Iowahc> anyone know an answer?
[02:09] <Alcor> heh
[02:09] <White-Horse> hi guys just wondering why or how ubuntu 9.04 32-bit works with wpa2 wireless N with no issues at all but ubuntu 9.10 crashes and if anyone knows ubuntu 10.04 will support wpa2 wireless N ?
[02:09] <tristan__> LinuxGuy2009 : http://pastebin.org/147599
[02:09] <LinuxGuy2009> Iowahc: answer to what? meaning of life etc?
=== blueghost is now known as No20Day
[02:10] <Iowahc> no, i know that one :D 42.
[02:10] <LinuxGuy2009>  tristan__: thank you
[02:10] <daftykins> White-Horse: it's not down to the versions of ubuntu supporting said wireless, it's more than likely the kernel based driver for your wireless hardware
[02:10] <Iowahc> no, as i mentioned earlier, a monitor tool to monitor HTTP traffic incoming to my server
[02:10] <mc_> Iowahc, I was oh so tempted to type 42 xD
[02:10] <tristan__> LinuxGuy2009 : thanks for helping me.
[02:10] <Losha> Iowahc: something here maybe: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/bandwidth-monitoring-tools-for-linux.html
[02:11] <monkeytwin> Iowahc: you could turn on snmpd, then process the info with cacti
[02:11] <Iowahc> monkeytwin: how exactly?
[02:11] <White-Horse> daftykins well if thats the case how can an older kernel work better then a newer one ?
[02:11] <daftykins> White-Horse: pretty sure regressions happen sometimes.
[02:11] <LinuxGuy2009>  tristan__: Hmm looks to me that your wireless may not be supported by the kernel possibly but i coul dbe wrong. Your looks to report just the regular wired lan only.
[02:11] <White-Horse> the said wireless is an Intel PRO 5100 ABGN
[02:11] <Out_Cold> ok weird question.. if i have for example /var/ mounted with / on sda1 and i cp /var to sda2 and mount sda2 on /var, does the original data stay on disk?
[02:12] <paragonc> how stable is ubuntu 10 right now in comparison to 10.4 ?
[02:12] <White-Horse> well does anyone here know if 10.04 will support wireless N ?
[02:12] <daftykins> "10" "10.4" ? what do you mean?
[02:12] <monkeytwin> monteith: so on your webserver... "aptitude install snmpd"  .  configure snmpd in /etc/default/snmpd and /etc/snmpd.conf . on another machine on the same local net as your webserver, or even on your webserver "aptitude install cacti".  then configure cacti
[02:12] <Out_Cold> paragonc, there is no plain 10
[02:12] <monkeytwin> oops not monteith
[02:12] <paragonc> Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Beta 1
[02:12] <Out_Cold> 10.04 and eventually 10.10
[02:13] <daftykins> White-Horse: as i say it's nothing to do with ubuntu's support. ask in #ubuntu+1 for more info though
[02:13] <LinuxGuy2009> paragonc: Beta2 is here
[02:13] <monkeytwin> Iowahc: there's probably a quickstart guide for cacti
[02:13] <White-Horse> ok thank you daftykins
[02:13] <tristan__> LinuxGuy2009 : I was using jolicloud and wireless worked if that means anything.  I assumed the kernel was the same.
[02:13] <Losha> Out_Cold: yes it does, but the original data is inaccessible while you have sda2 mounted 'on top of it'...
[02:13] <paragonc> will it upgrade from 9.10 ?
[02:13] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__: Do you know exactly what kernel you had in jolicloud?
[02:14] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__: Might have been newer?
[02:14] <tristan__> LinuxGuy2009 : I am not sure exactly.  yea, maybe.
[02:14] <Out_Cold> Losha, so if i mount all my folders and something crashes i still have the original data in there?
[02:15] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__: From what I see in your pastebin I would have to guess that your current kernel doesnt detect it correctly or at all.
[02:15] <Out_Cold> Losha, or i remove the disks..
[02:15] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__:I could be wrong however.
[02:15] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__: Do you happen to know for sure what the wireless cards make and model is?
[02:16] <Losha> Out_Cold: yes, at least in theory, but I think it's a rotten way to do backups....
[02:17] <paragonc> egh - all i want is netflix on my media center
[02:17] <Out_Cold> Losha, no i'm thinking it'll be my base server, i'll create all my configs and what not then mount the other disks.. if something happens to the lvms, i still have the original base server
[02:17]  * paragonc debates buying a mac mini
[02:18] <tristan__> LinuxGuy2009 : unsure.  my netbook is an asus eeepc 1001p
[02:18] <LinuxGuy2009> paragonc: hackintosh
[02:18] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__: k give me a sec here.
[02:19] <shazbotmcnasty> does anyone have "world of Padman"? And if so, is it any good?
[02:19] <tom_> join #geebox
[02:20] <LinuxGuy2009>  tristan__: As of February 2010 I see people resorting to ndiswrapper on that model netbook for wireless.
[02:20] <Losha> Out_Cold: I suppose, but you're assuming that whatever takes out your lvms won't damage the underlying file system. You've really just invented a whacked out, less reliable, non-standard weird backup scheme...
[02:20] <LinuxGuy2009>  tristan__: Perhaps the next release Lucid may support your card on release. #ubuntu+1 for people to ask this question.
[02:20] <Out_Cold> Losha, well i'll still create a good back up... it's a base server install anyways.. not much data I am relying on.
[02:21] <tristan__> LinuxGuy2009 : ok thank you.
[02:21] <LinuxGuy2009> shazbotmcnasty: Why not download and answer that question for yourself?
[02:21] <Out_Cold> Losha, if i wanted to remove my lvms I could still run the system though which IMO is a good thing
[02:21] <LinuxGuy2009> tristan__: Your welcome
[02:21] <_Tristan> another Tristan >.>
[02:21] <shazbotmcnasty> I AM
[02:21] <shazbotmcnasty> I WAS JUST WONDERING
[02:21] <shazbotmcnasty> ( <unconvertable> <unconvertable> )
[02:21] <emma> Is there no longer a way to encrypt a file in nautilus?
[02:22] <inglor> !caps
[02:22] <ubottu> PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[02:22] <shazbotmcnasty> emma, if you're using 10.04, you're not using nautilus I don't believe
[02:22] <shazbotmcnasty> I think you may be using pcmanfm2
[02:22] <emma> I'm using Karmic.
[02:22] <papul> :O
[02:22] <shazbotmcnasty> oh
[02:22] <emma> Isn't this #ubuntu ?
[02:22] <shazbotmcnasty> well then I don't know
[02:22] <Losha> Out_Cold: people usually use your kind of scheme with an automounter. If, for some reason, the remote nfs filesystems don't mount, you still have a local version of stuff to fall back on...
[02:22] <shazbotmcnasty> Actually...I want to get pcmanfm2
[02:22] <emma> Oh well you might want to go to #ubuntu+1
[02:22] <shazbotmcnasty> where to get?
[02:23] <emma> Because this channel is for support of Ubuntu Karmic and earlier.
[02:23] <Out_Cold> Losha, yea sounds like some hair-brained scheme that'll teach me not to mess with linux ;)
[02:23] <papul> shazbotmcnasty, u tried apt-get?
[02:23] <Losha> Out_Cold: :-)
[02:23] <shazbotmcnasty> no, but I don't believe it's in there
[02:23] <shazbotmcnasty> but i'll apt-cache search
[02:23] <_Tristan> I heard from an unreliable source that you could relatively easily make ubuntu run "in terminal" and have that terminal be the background
[02:24] <shazbotmcnasty> well you can have terminal as background
[02:24] <shazbotmcnasty> or you can be in terminal the whole time
[02:24] <_Tristan> I'm looking for a sort of middle ground
[02:24] <LinuxGuy2009> shazbotmcnasty: if you want to see all available packages make sure to enable main, universe, restricted, multiverse
[02:24] <shazbotmcnasty> if so, hit ctrl+alt+F2, odn't get scared though, ctrl+altF7 will bring you back
[02:25] <shazbotmcnasty> _Tristan, try guake, or tilde
[02:25] <shazbotmcnasty> they are dropdown terminal emulators that come down when you hit the tilde button on your keyboard
[02:25] <shazbotmcnasty> "~)
[02:25] <shazbotmcnasty> "~" *
[02:25] <shazbotmcnasty> it's meant to be like in computer games you had the console...
[02:25] <LinuxGuy2009> ~ god mode
[02:26] <meowbuntu> hi
[02:26] <shazbotmcnasty> LinuxGuy2009, that was totally half a sentence
[02:26] <shazbotmcnasty> the 'if you want to see all available...."
[02:26] <shazbotmcnasty> I'm now confused
[02:26] <shazbotmcnasty> \(_o)/
[02:26] <mcurran> Has anyone figured out a way to run xwinwrap as desktop background (screensaver) w/out covering the desktop icons...?
[02:26] <LinuxGuy2009>  shazbotmcnasty: No its a full sentence. You just dont know what repositories are.
[02:26] <shazbotmcnasty> yeah pcmanfm2 isn't in there
[02:26] <_Tristan> shazbotmcnasty: I really should have read the second half of that sentence before trying it out.
[02:26] <shazbotmcnasty> LinuxGuy2009, oh yes I do
[02:27] <Syrinx> Hi all!  Not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but whenever I run Firefox in 9.10 I get a message telling me to install Flash.  When I click next, it says "Plugin already installed."  And youtube for example will not play videos.
[02:27] <Syrinx> I've uninstalled and reinstalled the flash plugin via Synaptic
[02:27] <_Tristan> Syrinx: I think pretty much everyone gets that.
[02:27] <Syrinx> no dice
[02:27] <mcurran> Syrinx - Try installing the non-free version
[02:27] <Syrinx> Oh
[02:27] <GSF1200S> Syrinx: 32 or 64bit
[02:27] <Syrinx> 64 bit
[02:28] <Syrinx> Mcurran: that's what I'm using, via the restricted extras package
[02:28] <xangua> Syrinx: then you need to manualy download and install the 64 bits version from adobe's website
[02:28] <Syrinx> Ah, okay.
[02:28] <GSF1200S> syrinx: chrome or firefox?
[02:28] <Syrinx> FFox
[02:28] <meowbuntu> is there another cd/dvd burner i can try apart from brasero
[02:29] <mcurran> Nautilus has it's own I believe
[02:29] <myrl> ubottu tell myrl about nautilus
[02:29] <GSF1200S> grab the alpha 64 bit plugin from adobe, create a folder in your .mozilla folder called plugins, and put the libflashplayer.so file in there
[02:29] <meowbuntu> is there another cd/dvd burner i can try apart from brasero
[02:30] <shazbotmcnasty> meowbuntu, yes
[02:30] <Syrinx> GSF12005: I think I've tried that, but I'll give it another go
[02:30] <RoOoMi-eXe> bye all have nice time
[02:30] <meowbuntu> shazbotmcnasty, what
[02:30] <shazbotmcnasty> meowbuntu, lol I'm looking for the one I have
[02:30] <shazbotmcnasty> there are a lot
[02:30] <Iowahc> i need a tool to monitor what HTTP Headers hit my server? any?
[02:30] <tm0> Hey, i have gnome installed, but i'm running LXDE. Can i use Gnome keyboard shortcuts?
[02:31] <myrl> iowahc use php
[02:31] <nyhcjedi> fixed the youtube issue installed nonfree flash
[02:31] <shazbotmcnasty> meowbuntu, in synaptic look for 'cd/dvd'
[02:31] <shazbotmcnasty> also try gnomebaker
[02:31] <shazbotmcnasty> 'sudo apt-get install gnomebaker'
[02:31] <myrl> Iowahc use php
[02:31] <Iowahc> myrl: no option, need to see what a certain page (of an application) gets
[02:31] <GSF1200S> Syrinx: pm me if you have issues- I have NO flash plugins installed through APT.. only the libflashplayer.so in a plugins folder in .mozilla
[02:32] <meowbuntu> anyone here used xfburn
[02:32] <Syrinx> Cool, will do, thx!
[02:32] <shazbotmcnasty> meowbuntu, yes
[02:32] <shazbotmcnasty> it's okay
[02:32] <shazbotmcnasty> it will also work
[02:32] <myrl> Iowahc can't you add php on the page?
[02:32] <GSF1200S> Syrinx: you need the alpha plugin, make sure it isnt the 32bit version
[02:32] <Iowahc> myrl:  no, it is a generated page from a huge perl program.
[02:32] <meowbuntu> shazbotmcnasty, what is the best write mode to use for live cd tao or sao
[02:32] <Syrinx> Ah, okay..
[02:33] <paragonc> is rsync smart enough to know if a file is the same?
[02:34] <encels> Hi people..!
[02:34] <myrl> Iowahc then can't you put something like "print "<?php blah blah blah ?>""?
[02:34] <shazbotmcnasty> meowbuntu, try sao
[02:34] <Iowahc> myrl: no, don't know where the page is generated. would be a to heavy hack
[02:34] <meowbuntu> shazbotmcnasty, whats the differance i wonder
[02:34] <meowbuntu> no other burners use that
[02:34] <myrl> Iowahc what application is it?
[02:35] <Iowahc> a caldav server
[02:35] <myrl> ok
[02:35] <shazbotmcnasty> meowbuntu, TAO means "track at once"
[02:35] <shazbotmcnasty> SAO means "session at once", which is the same as "disk at once"
[02:35] <Iowahc> myrl: nevermind. will be running a sniffer... thx anyway
[02:35] <shazbotmcnasty>  other burners use it
[02:35] <shazbotmcnasty> just they don't usually make it an acronym
[02:36] <shazbotmcnasty> meowbuntu, and since a ISO does not have 'tracks' really
[02:36] <meowbuntu> shazbotmcnasty, ok but what is the diff between them
[02:36] <shazbotmcnasty> you should use SAO
[02:36] <shazbotmcnasty> tracks
[02:36] <shazbotmcnasty> like songs
[02:36] <shazbotmcnasty> a track is like a song

[02:37] <dr3mro> hi guys , in grub menu there is a recovery option that gives us bluescreen and another menu .. i need to add option to this menu how ??????
[02:37] <daftykins> !grub | dr3mro
[02:37] <ubottu> dr3mro: grub is the default boot manager for Ubuntu releases before Karmic (9.10). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - GRUB how-tos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto - See !grub2 for Karmic onwards.
[02:38] <meowbuntu> thanks shazbotmcnasty soon i can replace ubuntu with dpup yea
[02:38] <dr3mro> daftykins, ubottu no i mean the recovery menu not the grub menu
=== nosrepa is now known as aperson

[02:38] <myrl> ubottu hi
[02:38] <ubottu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu! Feel free to ask questions and help people out. The channel guidelines are at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines . Enjoy your stay!
[02:39] <abc123> I'd like to make a bash script that opens multiple terminal windows. Is this possible?
[02:39] <myrl> abc123 yes
[02:40] <daftykins> abc123: probably just repeatedly put "gnome-terminal &" for example
[02:40] <Random832> it's not actually possible to remove the root directory - the danger comes from removing everything under it
[02:40] <hiexpo> hey i use devedee to convert to dvd image file and it turns out fine but when i burn it / it becomes choppy and sticks been useing brasero ?
[02:40] <abc123> myrl, daftykins can you make bash scripts automatically run root?
[02:41] <myrl> abc123 yes
[02:41] <myrl> abc123 just put sudo
[02:41] <abc123> but you have to type in your password myrl
[02:41] <myrl> abc123 you can edit the sudoers file
[02:41] <LinuxGuy2009> hiexpo: I too havent had much luck in the way of video editing/authoring in the linux world either.
[02:42] <myrl> abc123 /etc/sudoers
[02:42] <ardchoille> abc123: yes, you still need the password.. which is good because you may damage something if you forget you're running as root
[02:42] <Nitsuga> dr3mro, the files you are looking for are in /usr/share/recovery-mode/
[02:42] <ntsasng> i can't saved resolv.conf
[02:42] <ntsasng> help me Plz
[02:42] <LinuxGuy2009> abc123: gksudo for GUI apps
[02:42] <hiexpo> LinuxGuy2009,  - i know its a tough one for some reason and i had it mastered in windows before now i guess i gotta master it here
[02:42] <corte> hey guys, quick question for anyone around--any idea why slocate doesn't pick up on my attached external HD?
[02:43] <corte> err--locate
[02:43] <myrl> corte you need to mount it first
[02:43] <corte> myrl, it is mounted, even after running updatedb i'm still not picking up any results
[02:44] <dr3mro> Nitsuga, if i want to add an item do i just add it as a script
[02:44] <ntsasng>  i can't saved resolv.conf
[02:44] <Nitsuga> dr3mro, it seems that you have to /usr/share/recovery-mode/options/name
[02:44] <LinuxGuy2009> ntsasng: dont have permission?
[02:44] <myrl> corte did you go to computer -> external drive and then search from there?
[02:44] <Nitsuga> dr3mro, to put an executable shell script there

[02:44] <corte> myrl, i was actually trying from the command line, rather than searching from nautilus
[02:45] <trinikrono> ntsasng:  use sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf
[02:45] <ntsasng> LinuxGuy2009: i make it with root
[02:45] <dr3mro> Nitsuga, thank you i wil try hello world script there to confirm
[02:45] <myrl> corte oh ok
[02:45] <corte> i prefer terminal :)
[02:45] <LinuxGuy2009> ntsasng: Come again?
[02:45] <ntsasng> trinikrono:  i make it with root
[02:45] <myrl> corte :)
[02:46] <Nitsuga> dr3mro, all the scripts returns 0 if you pass them the parameter "test"
[02:46] <Nitsuga> dr3mro, I think that it is needed for the script to appear
[02:46] <meowbuntu> for some inhouse entertainment while working on your computer try this http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=sons+of+korah+site:youtube.com&hl=en&lr=&sa=X&tbs=vid:1&tbo=u&ei=vnHCS_n8EtCHkAX29oHVBQ&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CC0QqwQwAw
[02:46] <trinikrono> ntsasng: did you say you made it using a root nautilus?
[02:47] <LinuxGuy2009> meowbuntu: #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:47] <dr3mro> Nitsuga, you are very helpfull thank you
[02:47] <ntsasng> trinikrono: i'm using this command sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf
[02:47] <trinikrono> ntsasng:  right
[02:47] <trinikrono> and what are you seeing then
[02:47] <myrl> corte sorry i can't find anything :(
[02:47] <ardchoille> !gksudo | ntsasng trinikrono
[02:47] <ubottu> ntsasng trinikrono: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use <unconvertable> gksudo <unconvertable> , as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
[02:48] <Nitsuga> dr3mro, thank you. I found that if you run sudo /usr/share/recovery-mode/recovery-menu you can test the menu without rebooting
[02:48] <ntsasng> trinikrono: i can't saved it
[02:48] <WebDawg> :(
[02:48] <LinuxGuy2009> ntsasng: gksudo gedit

[02:49] <whileimhere> Hi. I recently removed Pulse Audio from my Laptop with an Ubuntu 9.10 installation. I see that my GNOME panel app is now MIA. Anyone know why or how to get it back?
[02:49] <WebDawg> LinuxGuy2009 its all over the internet and no one has answered how to fix.
[02:49] <Nitsuga> WebDawg, pretty common, restart your session and you will have he applet again
[02:49] <LinuxGuy2009> whileimhere: sudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer
[02:49] <ntsasng>  LinuxGuy2009: gksudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf can't saved it
[02:49] <myrl> sudo apt-get moo

[02:50] <WebDawg> Nitsuga I have restarted many times.
[02:50] <WebDawg> I tried to install it but it says that it has been replaced by GDM Nitsuga
[02:50] <LinuxGuy2009> WebDawg: Happens sometimes.
[02:50] <WebDawg> LinuxGuy2009 and Nitsuga how do I install it?
[02:50] <Nitsuga> WebDawg, try alt-f2> killall gnome-panel
[02:51] <LinuxGuy2009> WebDawg: Install what?
[02:51] <Nitsuga> WebDawg, that will refresh the panel
[02:51] <whileimhere> Thanks LinuxGuy2009 it worked fine.
[02:51] <LinuxGuy2009> myrl: Can you please go troll in #windows again please?
[02:51] <myrl> linuxguy2009: why?
[02:51] <corte> myrl, the solution was to modify PRUNEPATHS (remove /media from this list) in /etc/updatedb.conf..thanks anyway!
[02:51] <LinuxGuy2009> whileimhere: your welcome
[02:52] <myrl> corte: oh sorry :)
[02:52] <WebDawg> Nitsuga the problem comes up over and over and over and over again.  I am missing that applet.

[02:55] <WebDawg> i moved that dir out of my gconf dir for my gnome panel.
[02:55] <MikeGuo> hi, guys,  anyone have document about ubuntu system install, boot ?
[02:55] <WebDawg> the problem is...this panel app is the one that had the logon/logoff shit.

[02:56] <Nitsuga> WebDawg, when it's missing the logout/off things are in System menu
[02:56] <WebDawg> Nitsuga I know this.
[02:57] <WebDawg> Nitsuga what is the applet called that IS that thing.
[02:57] <Nitsuga> WebDawg, i once had that problem, and solved it by killing gnome-panel and putting the applet again on its place
[02:57] <mc_> LinuxGuy no need to be an asshole
[02:57] <cambazz> hello. how do I sync my hardware clock
[02:57] <januszeal> netstat isn't showing the entire IP (it's showing ::ffff:202.83.102:50796, for example) how do I get it to display the entire host?
[02:57] <chris4585> !language
[02:57] <ubottu> Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
[02:57] <LinuxGuy2009> mc_: ditto
[02:57] <cambazz> ntp or something like that
[02:57] <abc123> how do you open multiple tabs in the same terminal window when writing a bash script?
[02:57] <januszeal> because without displaying the entire IP netstat is almost completely useless
[02:58] <ntsasng> i'm using sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf -->>You do not have the permissions necessary to save the file. Please check that you typed the location correctly and try again.
[02:58] <Nitsuga> WebDawg, don't know why, but it is nnot in the list
[02:59] <LinuxGuy2009> ntsasng: gksudo gedit. Then manually open the file and do your thing.
[02:59] <ntsasng> LinuxGuy2009:  gksudo ... --> same
[02:59] <robertzaccour> brb
[03:00] <abc123> LinuxGuy2009, how do you open multiple tabs in the same terminal window when writing a bash script?
[03:00] <januszeal> is there a rule here on freenode that we're supposed to ignore questions that point out flaws in linux software?
[03:00] <Cream> Anybody speaks italian?
[03:00] <Nitsuga> <abc123> how do you open multiple tabs in the same terminal window when writing a bash script? command line apps can't interact with the terminal emulator. You can open a new tab of gnome-terminal but it will not work as expected if you are not running gnome-terminal or you don't have it installed
[03:00] <cj__> I am a newer
[03:00] <LinuxGuy2009> abc123: If your writing a bash script you can use a plain text editor if you like.
[03:00] <brax> What's the shortcut key to change desktops?
[03:00] <cj__> how to use this chat
[03:01] <brax> Like that, cj__.
[03:01] <abc123> LinuxGuy2009, but what is the command to start  a new tab?

[03:01] <cj__> ?
[03:01] <brax> Just type somethiing and press enter.
[03:01] <brax> LinuxGuy2009, that isn't working for some curious reason.
[03:01] <whileimhere> Silly question but whens the next Ubuntu Release?
[03:01] <cj__> I got it ,it is easy
[03:01] <LinuxGuy2009> abc123: Shift+Ctrl+T?

[03:02] <abc123> LinuxGuy2009, I meant in a bash script
[03:02] <januszeal> Nitsuga: did you read what I pasted?
[03:02] <Nitsuga> cj__, a year and half
[03:02] <LinuxGuy2009> abc123: umm
[03:02] <burnsb> Can anyone recommend a IRC channel that could help with serial com scripts?
[03:02] <januszeal> W 37
[03:03] <whileimhere> Thanks xangua BTW is that a nick from a pratchett character?
[03:03] <Nitsuga> januszeal,  netstat isn't showing the entire IP (it's showing ::ffff:202.83.102:50796, for example) how do I get it to display the entire host?
[03:03] <Ninja_> Can anyone point me to a tutorial on how to customize conky's colors and position on the screen?
[03:03] <cj__> Nitsuga,I used it three years ago
[03:03] <xangua> whileimhere: no idea what are you talking about :)
[03:03] <abc123> LinuxGuy2009, "umm"? do I put a slash before that or anything?
[03:03] <januszeal> Nitsuga: that's not a complete IP
[03:03] <paragonc> hrmmm still trying to rsync these drives - and somehow the drive keeps turning to read only - then i have to unmount and remount it
[03:03] <januszeal> it's also not really an ipv6 address
[03:03] <whileimhere> LOL
[03:03] <whileimhere> Okay then
[03:03] <LinuxGuy2009> abc123: --tab-with-profile=PROFILENAME

[03:04] <januszeal> Nitsuga: regardless of what kind of ip address it is, it's not complete
[03:05] <mcurran> I would like to be able to scan higher or lower frequencies with my wifi card...
[03:05] <cj__> Nitsuga ,this software is for connecting with ubuntu's friend
[03:05] <LinuxGuy2009> abc123: I just told you how. If you need more details "man gnome-terminal".
[03:05] <brax> There is a last.fm tab there, robertzaccour.
[03:05] <mcurran> 900 MHz would be cool.
[03:05] <hiexpo> robertzaccour, what do ya mean radio like music radio
[03:05] <LinuxGuy2009> abc123: You here to troll?

[03:06] <jojo> hi
[03:06] <brax> robert, go into Applications, Music and Video, Rhythmbox.
[03:06] <abc123> LinuxGuy2009, I'm gonna have to report/ignore you if you continue with the insults

[03:06] <Bleach> how to use wget comments in terminal to download an rapidshare.. file.
[03:06] <LinuxGuy2009> abc123: Same here.
[03:06] <Nitsuga> cj__, you can ask for support here. And there are dozens of channels for every free software program out there. Even you can ask for windows support on ##windows !
[03:06] <hiexpo> Bleach, its not happening
[03:06] <mcurran> Anyone know how to turn on tor for connections through terminal, ie. ping, traceroute, etc. or does it only work through browsers (port 80,8080)
[03:07] <LinuxGuy2009> abc123:  And yes you do put a - before the ummm.
[03:07] <abc123> how do you open multiple tabs in the same terminal window when writing a bash script, anyone?
[03:07] <hiexpo> the best downloader for rapidshare is jdownloader
[03:07] <cj__> Nitsuga,I am a chinese,what about you ?
[03:08] <ianwizard> I'm trying to come up with a backup solution.  I tried double mounting my root partition read only, and I was going to rsync that.  But it didn't work.  Any advice for a full system backup.  (Preferably something that I can boot from.)
[03:08] <Nitsuga> cj__, argentininan :)
[03:08] <Nitsuga> januszeal, I still don't get what's wrong with it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address
[03:08] <LinuxGuy2009> abc123: "gnome-terminal --tab-with-profile=PROFILENAME"
[03:08] <ianwizard> cj__, American
[03:08] <januszeal> Nitsuga: ignore the ::fff
[03:08] <januszeal> it's not a complete address
[03:09] <mcurran> sudo cp /dev/hda/.* /dev/<etc>
[03:09] <mcurran> then just install bootloader to other device
[03:09] <cj__> Nitsuga ,is linux popular in your country
[03:10] <ianwizard> but /dev/hda1 is a file
[03:10] <Nitsuga> januszeal, it is an IPv4 202.83.102 mapped to IPv6 and in port 50796
[03:10] <Bleach>  how to use wget comments in terminal
[03:10] <mcurran> git co http://...
[03:10] <januszeal> Nitsuga: oh, really? I was not aware ip4 addresses were only 3 segments
[03:11] <ianwizard> I can't copy the files from it, and using dd wouldn't work because I can't use it while the fs is mounted, or the result will be corrupt
[03:11] <Bleach> hiexpo, through wget
[03:11] <Nitsuga> cj__, not much. I don't know anyone who uses it in real-life. But in 3 days Richard Stall man will come to my town, and I'm seeing a lot of linux activity on the inet.
[03:11] <LinuxGuy2009>  ianwizard: Need some help?
[03:11] <prappl93> Is there a way to tell if my computer can support Ubuntu 9.10?
[03:12] <Nitsuga> januszeal, ohh you got me
[03:12] <dancallo> prappl93: yes, use the liveCD
[03:12] <LinuxGuy2009> prappl93: Download and test the live CD
[03:12] <januszeal> Nitsuga: welcome to 20 minutes ago
[03:12] <prappl93> Is there a way to test it without downloading the LIVE CD? Cause I just wanted to check before, because I have used it before and it lags a lot.
[03:12] <Nitsuga> januszeal, anyway it is a valid address. A missing segment is equivalent to 255 (multicast)
[03:12] <januszeal> Nitsuga: i was not aware I was calling verizon support, why do you guys always assume the person asking the question is retarded
[03:12] <hiexpo> Bleach, wget will not work with rapidshare the one that i have found that works the best for me is jdownloader
[03:12] <LinuxGuy2009> Bleach: man wget
[03:12] <januszeal> Nitsuga: bro that is not what is going on here
[03:13] <dancallo> prappl93: not that I'm aware of. You'll need the live CD for that.
[03:13] <januszeal> Nitsuga: look at this unanswered thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=744130
[03:13] <Nitsuga> okay

[03:17] <EdgEy> Does anyone know of a tool I can use to merge two .avi files without reencoding?
[03:18] <LinuxGuy2009> EdgEy: avidemux  I think might
[03:18] <Nitsuga> januszeal, i found the soluion on netstat manual
[03:18] <LinuxGuy2009> EdgEy:Unless they use different codecs maybe.
[03:18] <Nitsuga> januszeal, use option -W   ( --wide )
[03:18] <EdgEy> LinuxGuy2009, nah, they're same codec, just split across two CD's
[03:18] <brez> Hey - is there a way to associate a "screen" with a name, rather than a number, eg> screen -rfreenode, rather than screen -r 1105??
[03:18] <januszeal> Nitsuga: not a valid flag
[03:18] <paragonc> can someone look @ this rsync error and tell me what the problem is?

[03:23] <LinuxGuy2009>  robertzaccour: Did you already add your account to empathy?
[03:23] <robertzaccour> maybe i should install pidgin instead
[03:23] <robertzaccour> yep
[03:23] <abc123> LinuxGuy2009, how do you make the new commands appear in the new tab that is opened in the way you showed me?
[03:23] <robertzaccour> i don't empathy is as good as pidgin
[03:23] <robertzaccour> thats just one person's perspective though
[03:24] <LinuxGuy2009> robertzaccour: I prefer pidgin too
[03:24] <tangji> hello every body
[03:24] <miato> good morning
[03:24] <robertzaccour> i guess after its not supported after next year we'll have to add it to the repos

[03:25] <LinuxGuy2009> LinuX2half: Same browser with 2 instances?
[03:25] <xangua> LinuX2half: instal 2 web browsers ;)
[03:25] <miato> my ubuntu always stuck/hang
[03:25] <LinuxGuy2009> LinuX2half: Ok so just install them.
[03:25] <LinuX2half> Running them at the same time
[03:25] <miato> why this happen
[03:25] <LinuxGuy2009> LinuX2half: Ok so whats your question?
[03:25] <LinuX2half> I'm using swiftfox and firefox
[03:25] <robertzaccour> LinuX2half, whats the difference?
[03:25] <LinuX2half> If one of them is open, then the other needs to be exit to open the another one
[03:26] <LinuxGuy2009> LinuX2half: ok
[03:26] <abc123> can anyone tell me how do you make new commands appear in a new tab that is opened in a bash script?
[03:26] <EdgEy> LinuxGuy2009, just tried it, works perfectly, :) thanks
[03:26] <xangua> LinuX2half: you can't.........maybe creating diferent profiles <unconvertable>
[03:26] <LinuxGuy2009> EdgEy: welcome
[03:26] <tangji> hello
[03:26] <tangji> where i can found suffix
[03:26] <miato> my ubuntu always stuck/hang, how i can solved the problem ?
[03:27] <abc123> can anyone tell me how do you make commands appear in a new tab that is opened in a bash script?
[03:27] <xangua> miato: the less information you tell, the less we can help
[03:27] <Nitsuga> abc123, try adding -c 'command1; command2 --option; command3;'
[03:27] <miato> that is information
[03:28] <miato> stuck when use firefox
[03:28] <miato> cannot click anything but possible to move the cursor
[03:28] <xangua> miato: if you have no many resources then don't use fx
[03:29] <miato> any other good web browser ?
[03:29] <LinuxGuy2009> miato: google chrome is nice
[03:30] <desynch> hi
[03:30] <xangua> !browser | miato
[03:30] <ubottu> miato: Browsers available for Ubuntu: Firefox (GTK, Gecko engine), Konqueror (KDE/Qt, KHTML engine), Epiphany (GTK, Gecko engine), Dillo (GTK), w3m (terminal-based), Links2 (terminal-based or graphical, see !man page), edbrowse (command-line), Opera (Qt, proprietary)
[03:30] <desynch> what could be the repo of ubuntu 8.10?
[03:30] <xangua> midori is very light too
[03:30] <desynch> i want to download ndiswrapper
[03:30] <cj__> LinuxGuy2009,chrome is better than firefox
[03:30] <desynch> im using backtrack
[03:30] <xangua> !backtrack | desynch
[03:30] <ubottu> desynch: There are some Ubuntu derivatives that we cannot provide support for due to repository and software changes. Please consult their websites for more information. Examples: gNewSense (support in #gnewsense), Linux Mint (see !mintsupport), LinuxMCE (support in #linuxmce), CrunchBang (support in #crunchbang), BackTrack (support in #backtrack-linux)
[03:30] <miato> can tell me how to install chrome on terminal ?
[03:30] <abc123> Nitsuga, it says -c: command not found
[03:30] <LinuxGuy2009> cj__: you asking or stating?
[03:30] <xangua> you can install ndiswrapper from the cd i believe
[03:31] <hunahpu> desynch: you can download the packages manually from http://packages.ubuntu.com
[03:31] <LinuxGuy2009> miato: http://www.google.com/chrome
[03:31] <desynch> hunahpu, but i want the exact ndiswrapper for this distro
[03:31] <miato> ok then what should i choose
[03:31] <miato> 32 bit or 64 bit
[03:31] <desynch> im trying to download the drivers for bcm4312
[03:31] <LinuxGuy2009> miato: we dont know.
[03:32] <robertzaccour> chrome is good, however it doesn't integrate with themes
[03:32] <mc_> miato Chrome is good, Opera is good also
[03:32] <Nitsuga> abc123, got it: gnome-terminal --tab-with-profile=default -e 'commands'
[03:32] <robertzaccour> and there isn't as many video codecs for it as firefox
[03:32] <xangua> robertzaccour: yes it does
[03:32] <robertzaccour> xangua, not really, unless there's a matching theme you can change
[03:32] <LinuxGuy2009> desynch: install package bcmwl-kernel-source
[03:33] <mc_> miato try reinstalling firefox, it works perfect for most people
[03:33] <xangua> robertzaccour: chrome/chomium integrates with gtk theme; what dcoes  video codecs has to do <unconvertable>
[03:33] <LinuxGuy2009> desynch: or add CDROM as package source and look in hardware drivers window.
[03:33] <Chazz> Where does Ubuntu store the default content (Default wallpaper, Gnome theme, content in ~, etc.) for a new user profile?
[03:33] <robertzaccour> for example. install google-chrome and notice how different the window border looks, doesn't match themes
[03:33] <robertzaccour> oh chromium. haven't tried it
[03:33] <robertzaccour> is chromium easy to install?
[03:33] <LinuxGuy2009> Chazz: /usr/share/
[03:34] <xangua> robertzaccour: you can also tell chrome/chromium to use the native borders
[03:34] <Chazz> LinuxGuy2009, ty
[03:34] <LinuxGuy2009> Chazz: welcome
[03:34] <xangua> robertzaccour: chromium is incluided in lucid repository
[03:34] <robertzaccour> cool its in the repos
[03:34] <LinuxGuy2009> yep thats what Im using nice to have in the repo
[03:34] <jhambo> is it true that irssi is not in ubuntu?? kpackagekit doesn't show it
[03:34] <robertzaccour> just checked right after i asked lol
[03:34] <Nitsuga> Chazz, /etc/profile and /usr/share/gconf/defaults/ (and also some applications save them somewhere in /usr/share)
[03:34] <cj__> LinuxGuy2009,I'm a chinese ,what about you ?
[03:34] <Chazz> Nitsuga, ok, thanks! :D
[03:35] <LinuxGuy2009> cj__: Have an ubuntu support question?
[03:35] <xangua> jhambo: no, it's not
[03:35] <jhambo> also I can't seem to get firefox working.  When I go to it from menu it brings up some "firefox installer" how can I launch firefox
[03:35] <xangua> jhambo: some fx installer <unconvertable>
[03:36] <myrl> how do you create your own custom terminal command?
[03:36] <cj__> LinuxGuy2009,I haven't questiong present
[03:36] <LinuxGuy2009> myrl: Learn python or some programming language
[03:36] <robertzaccour> hey chromium looks just like google chrome
[03:37] <robertzaccour> not integrated gtk theme
[03:37] <cj__> LinuxGuy2009,how long have you use linux ?
[03:37] <robertzaccour> and buttons are on the right
[03:37] <myrl> linuxguy2009 i already know one
[03:37] <jhambo> so what would be the "ubuntu way" to get irssi onto my system?
[03:37] <myrl> linuxguy2009 what do you do next?
[03:37] <xangua> robertzaccour: you have to tell chromium to use gtk theme in the preferences
[03:37] <robertzaccour> how do i make chromium integrate with the current set theme?
[03:37] <robertzaccour> oh ok thanks
[03:37] <LinuxGuy2009> cj__: #ubuntu-offtopic to join all the other chinese people?
[03:37] <robertzaccour> xangua, and how do ya get the buttons back to the left side?
[03:37] <xangua> jhambo: sudo apt-get install irssi <unconvertable>
=== plasma is now known as Guest69723
[03:38] <xangua> robertzaccour: tell it to use the native borders :S
[03:38] <LinuxGuy2009> myrl: Perhaps stop channel hopping and trolling for starters?
[03:38] <kleber> exit
[03:38] <myrl> linuxguy2009 huh?
[03:39] <LinuxGuy2009> myrl: huh?
[03:39] <IdleOne> jhambo: sudo apt-get install irssi
[03:39] <myrl> linuxguy2009 huh?
[03:39] <robertzaccour> xangua, ah ok thanks

[03:40] <FriedrichMan> hello, what's up'
[03:40] <ethen637> good time :)
[03:40] <FriedrichMan> got a question about traceroute
[03:40] <cj__> Bleach,hello
[03:40] <FriedrichMan> how come when I #traceroute "a_site.com" I only get *** instead of ips?
[03:41] <mc_> FriedrichMan, ICMP is filtered
[03:41] <Bleach> cj__ , hi
[03:41] <FriedrichMan> mc_: how do I solve this?
[03:42] <cj__> Bleach,I'm chinese ,what about you ?
[03:42] <mc_> well, there are traceroute variants using tcp ports (like echo) try it
[03:42] <FriedrichMan> cause if I traceroute thru http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/visual-tracert/ then I get the hosts... but on command line i only get ***
[03:42] <xangua> cj__: do you have any ubuntu related question <unconvertable>
[03:43] <jhambo> where do I change keybindings in kde?
[03:43] <cj__> xangua,I don't have present
[03:43] <Bleach> cj__ , check ur private chat
[03:43] <FriedrichMan> mc_: echo?
[03:44] <MoMo> I have a box that whos internet connection is very slow (ubuntu 7.10)  i would like to create a mirror on a removable hard drive and then take it to the server and mount that for updating packages -- does anyone know a good howto for this -- i've tried some but it says use http://archeive.... for the deb and i don't think thats right
[03:44] <robertzaccour> is there a difference between chrome and chromium?
[03:44] <mc_> FriedrichMan, when you use traceroute you just use hostnames not the URL
[03:44] <xangua> MoMo: 7.10 is not supported anymore
[03:45] <xangua> robertzaccour: chomium is free software, chrome is not
[03:45] <mc_> try traceroute www.yougetsignal.com
[03:45] <mc_> I just tried
[03:45] <robertzaccour> oh whats a good site for internet radio stations? i got some url spots to fill in rhythmbox
[03:45] <mc_> and showed me all the hops
[03:45] <MoMo> xangua: thats not my problem the server can't be upgraded -- there has to be a way to create the mirror ... please don't be difficult ... i rather try and find a soultion then just say no
[03:45] <robertzaccour> xangua, i thought chrome is supposed to be open source
[03:45] <ShazbotMcGroovy> robertzaccour, it depends on what you're int
[03:45] <ShazbotMcGroovy> into
[03:45] <ShazbotMcGroovy> if you want techno /dnb /weird
[03:45] <ShazbotMcGroovy> go to soma.fm
[03:45] <IdleOne> !ot | robertzaccour
[03:45] <ubottu> robertzaccour: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics. Thanks!
[03:46] <mc_> echo is just another protocol, do some googling, I don't want to complicate the issue by talking about it too much
[03:46] <FriedrichMan> mc_: that's what I do, I #traceroute google.com
[03:46] <ShazbotMcGroovy> !ot | ShazbotMcGroovy
[03:46] <ubottu> ShazbotMcGroovy, please see my private message
[03:46] <FriedrichMan> and I get a series of *** back
[03:46] <ShazbotMcGroovy> oh my, that is one smart bot
[03:46] <mc_> your ISP must be filtering ICMP, works for me
[03:46] <robertzaccour> questions pertaining to software installed by default in Ubuntu is offtopic?
[03:46] <MonkeyKnits> How do you back up stuff in ubuntu so you can reformat and reinstall?
[03:46] <ethen637> mc: echo is not protocol
[03:47] <IdleOne> robertzaccour: polls on good radio stations is
[03:47] <ShazbotMcGroovy> I'm pretty sure ISPs don't filter ICMPs
[03:47] <Bleach> hiexpo , thank u pal.
[03:47] <ShazbotMcGroovy> that wouldn't make any sense at all
[03:47] <robertzaccour> i'll rephrase that
[03:47] <FriedrichMan> mc_: so there's no way to bypass this?
[03:47] <brax> How do I stop something currently installing with apt-get?
[03:47] <ShazbotMcGroovy> that would also be troubleshooting hell
[03:47] <Bleach> hiexpo , jdownloader works
[03:47] <ShazbotMcGroovy> brax, ctrl+c
[03:47] <robertzaccour> does anyone know of any good sites with radio URLs compatible with RHYTHMBOX?
[03:48] <brax> ShazbotMcGroovy, how do I clean up the mess afterwards?
[03:48] <IdleOne> robertzaccour: still offtopic.
[03:48] <MoMo> no one knows of a mirror for the 7.10?
[03:48] <robertzaccour> rhythmbox is offtopic?
[03:48] <xangua> MonkeyKnits: by copy them to a cd, dvd, usb stick, another partition/disk <unconvertable>
[03:48] <ShazbotMcGroovy> IdleOne, nah I think that's on topic
[03:48] <ShazbotMcGroovy> one second let me see how to do it robertzaccour
[03:48] <robertzaccour> its just as offtopic as "where can i find gnome themes online"
[03:48] <puffin> Where can I find some new gnome themes?
[03:48] <IdleOne> robertzaccour: that is not ubuntu support related. if rythbox was causing an error it would be different. we are not IRC411 :)
[03:48] <MonkeyKnits> let me rephrase, how do I back up data from ubuntu applications so I can reinstall
[03:48] <LinuxGuy2009> robertzaccour: You need a random online radio link to test or what?
[03:49] <robertzaccour> a site with a bunch of good ones
[03:49] <MonkeyKnits> for example, my mail program does not give an option to back up my email or my contancts
[03:49] <woodyjlw> anyone know if magicjack will work with ubuntu soon?
[03:49] <robertzaccour> woodyjlw, its supposed to later this year
[03:50] <mc_> ethen637, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_protocol
[03:50] <xangua> (21:47:49) robertzaccour: does anyone know of any good sites with radio URLs compatible with RHYTHMBOX? - shoutcast, icecast; there is even a plugin
[03:50] <LinuxGuy2009> woodyjlw: magic jack is great and cheap but by the time you add in the electricity keeping your PC on all the time. Aint so great.
[03:50] <ShazbotMcGroovy> okay I'm going to GO
[03:50] <brax> ShazbotMcGroovy, how do I clean up the mess afterwards?
[03:50] <ShazbotMcGroovy> brax, it shouldn't have made a mess
[03:50] <woodyjlw> robertzaccour,  is there anything on the web about it? I cant find anything on it yet
[03:50] <robertzaccour> xangua, oh ok thanks
[03:50] <ShazbotMcGroovy> but you can do 'sudo apt-get autoremove'
[03:50] <brax> What about the leftover files?
[03:50] <brax> Okay, thanks.
[03:50] <MoMo> found the 7.10 repositories incase anyone cared http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/
[03:51] <_stryk3r> can someone help me figure out what I record with recordMyDesktop ends up like in fastforward mode by itself?
[03:51] <candy_> i have eclipse.tar.gz file... can anybody suggest me how to install eclipse??
[03:51] <ethen637> i though echo is just utility
[03:51] <mc_> FriedrichMan not sure, let me google
[03:51] <robertzaccour> recordmydesktop is good for distro reviews on youtube
[03:51] <brax> candy_: delete the file.
[03:51] <ziroday> candy_: "sudo apt-get install eclipse"
[03:51] <hiexpo> Bleach, yes
[03:51] <brax> candy_: then do that ^ in the terminal.
[03:51] <myrl> hi
[03:51] <woodyjlw> LinuxGuy2009,  I have a cell phone so I dont keep it on all the time. only need it for faxing really. and some calls
[03:52] <candy_> brax, that takes alot of time
[03:52] <FriedrichMan> mc_: ok thanks, I don't even know how to figure out whether my ISP is filtering or not
[03:52] <ShazbotMcGroovy> also brax if you want to go further you can do 'sudo apt-get clean'
[03:52] <brax> 3x
[03:52] <candy_> ziroday, so i asked my fren to get me that fine... my internet inn slow
[03:52] <mc_> FriedrichMan, does ping work for you?
[03:52] <brax> Thanks ShazbotMcGroovy.
[03:52] <FriedrichMan> yeap
[03:52] <ziroday> candy_: pardon?
[03:52] <FriedrichMan> the ping works perfectly
[03:52] <navetz> guys i am having a lot of trouble with the speed of eclipse on ubuntu
[03:52] <candy_> ziroday, brax, from terminal it takes alot of time
[03:53] <navetz> im using the sub libraries and all that stuff too
[03:53] <candy_> ziroday, so i got that file from fren and wanna install using some commands..
[03:53] <Bleach> hiexpo , i had integrated the jdownloder with firefox ... so that now i can download all rapidshare files
[03:53] <mc_> hmm, it means that most likely they don't
[03:53] <ziroday> candy_: right, well that's not the best way to do it
[03:53] <hiexpo> Bleach, kool

[04:06] <Out_Cold> supermatt1000, just remove 3.5 and reinstall 3.0
[04:06] <LinuxGuy2009> rgs_: When you switch to gtkpod its best to totally start from scratch the itunes db and all.
[04:06] <supermatt1000> i tried
[04:06] <supermatt1000> keeps going back
[04:06] <Out_Cold> supermatt1000, then you didn't remove it

[04:08] <rgs_> LinuxGuy2009: k, thanks.. I'll give it a try
[04:08] <Out_Cold> supermatt1000, look in synaptic, purge 3.5 and install 3.0

=== Guest2133 is now known as Gadg3t
[04:12] <supermatt1000> i cant figure out how to unstall it
[04:13] <LinuxGuy2009> Guest2133: i experienced simaler things with 9.10. I skipped that release for those very reasons.
[04:13] <supermatt1000> i uninstalled all firefox packages
[04:13] <supermatt1000> but its still there
[04:13] <Gadg3t> well it was working fine then just went nuts today
[04:13] <Gadg3t> i am using 9.10
[04:13] <Out_Cold> supermatt1000, right click, purge, apply
[04:13] <Diverdude> What is the best processor available on the market at the moment?
[04:14] <FriedrichMan> anybody has any info on why command "traceroute" might display "***" instead of actual ip's?
[04:14] <LinuxGuy2009> Diverdude: offtopic
[04:14] <supermatt1000> Out_Cold where is purge?
[04:15] <Spats_> quit
[04:15] <Out_Cold> supermatt1000, in synaptic? right click the package, select purge, apply from tool bar menu
[04:15] <supermatt1000> Out_Cold i dont have that when i right click that and i uninstall all fire fox packages
[04:16] <Out_Cold> supermatt1000, make sure it's 3.5
[04:16] <jeeves> what is the command to totally clean an apt-get install?  I'm having serious dep issues when I pull "apt-get upgrade -f"
[04:16] <Out_Cold> ugh.. one second i'll find cli command
[04:16] <FriedrichMan>  anybody has any info on why command "traceroute" might display "***" instead of actual ip's?
[04:16] <LinuxGuy2009> supermatt1000: sudo apt-get autoremove? that what you need?
[04:17] <Out_Cold> LinuxGuy2009, is the package firefox for 3.5?
[04:17] <supermatt1000> no i just need to completely remove fire fox and reinstall 3.0
[04:18] <Out_Cold> apt-get remove --purge firefox?
[04:18] <supermatt1000> got it i think
[04:18] <supermatt1000> i got it unisalled
[04:18] <LinuxGuy2009> supermatt1000: maybe "sudo apt-get remove firefox*" and "sudo apt-get install firefox-3.0"?
[04:19] <Out_Cold> 3.7 is in the repos XD
[04:19] <LinuxGuy2009> supermatt1000: sudo apt-get autoremove
