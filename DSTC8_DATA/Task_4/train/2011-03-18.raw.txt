[06:48] <tonnez> why is my Core i7 ubuntu server have a i686 kernel?
[06:48] <tonnez> can i convert this?
[06:49] <dejan_> I have probems watching videos in  the browser
[06:49] <kaushal> like a pop up or some sort of alert
[06:49] <raido> tonnez: no. you need to reinstall the entire OS
[06:49] <dejan_> i did some command guy here told me and  since then i have problems
[06:49] <ejv> raido: ah, im late to the conversation apparently.
[06:49] <Leakin> yes hello does the latest ubuntu have support for MSI installers
[06:49] <ejv> tonnez: if it's working you could just enable PAE and not break something that's fixed :p
[06:50] <rww> tonnez: because you installed Ubuntu 32-bit. You can't go from 32-bit to 64-bit without a reinstall.
[06:50] <raido> ejv: np, technically its possible but all the stuff he has there is bound to have newer packages
[06:50] <ejv> it's prolly hit or miss with unknown scientific/academic software *shrug*
[06:50] <dejan_> i had problems when I watched videos in fullscreen they had white flshes so one guy here on #ubuntu told me to execute terminal command and fter that sometimes I can watch videos in browser but sometimes no

[06:50] <tonnez> i'm assuming that is not good for i7
[06:50] <tonnez> how do i enable PAE?
[06:51] <tonnez> apache will not benefit from PAE will it?
[06:51] <bazhang> tonnez, install linux-generic-pae
[06:51] <raido> tonnez: do you want PAE to access more ram?
[06:51] <ejv> would require compiling a new kernel if your memory isn't already fully addressed, or using a precompiled image
[06:51] <Leakin> pythoned what if we petition the developers to include MSI support
[06:51] <Leakin> for easier microsoft integration
[06:51] <pythoned> Leakin,  MSI is proprietary...

=== cnegrete is now known as NuttyBunny
[06:59] <airtonix> Aquaguy: the other way you can do it is to use the --bind function of mount ( which overcomes limitations imposed by soft symlinks)

[07:14] <alkisg> Hi. Am I correct in that newer Ubuntu versions don't support floppy disks out of the box, and to get support for them, one would need to manually install the fdutils package?

[07:18] <raido> alkisg: Prolly, in those cases the floppy kernel module was blacklisted by default.

I was trying out Touchegg and creating a file like described here https://code.google.com/p/touchegg/wiki/ConfigureDevices And that actually gave me a "better feeling" trackpad experience - it seemed to respond more like on OS X. No lost selections and failty clicks. I lost multitouch though so i reverted it.

[07:25] <raido> GeneralK: So you have a ntfs partition that you want to use in Linux
[07:25] <GeneralK> raido, Yes. According to parted, it's the number 2 partition on /dev/sda
[07:26] <MichealH> GeneralK, Does it show up in the Places menu? You want to open the ntfs partition?
[07:26] <raido> GeneralK: so make a mount point in /media, like "sudo mkdir /media/ntfsdrive"
[07:27] <GeneralK> MichealH, No, not in the places menu.
[07:27] <_antant> ok, how do allow a network user to delete files off a share?
[07:28] <GeneralK> raido, Yep, done...
[07:28] <MichealH> _antant, Im not familiar with Linux networking but I beleive "sudo chmod 777 file.file"can do the trick on the file

[07:39] <raido> GeneralK: Is the ntfs partition on a raid volume
[07:40] <_antant> Huh. Can I take ownership of my external ntfs drive away from root?
[07:42] <GeneralK> raido, Well, I think the system might see it as one. Technically it isn't, it's just 1 HD. Check out http://paste.ubuntu.com/581964/ for the output from parted.

[07:43] <schinken> morning
[07:44] <GeneralK> raido, NTFS signature is missing. Failed to mount '/dev/sda': Invalid argument The device '/dev/sda' doesn't seem to have a valid NTFS. Maybe the wrong device is used? Or the whole disk instead of a partition (e.g. /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1)? Or the other way around?

[07:46] <Softdroid> Is
[07:46] <Fuchs> Softdroid: vlc and mplayer should be able to (not interactivly) play it, else you can watch them in a browser with the adobe flash plugin

[07:47] <Softdroid> Fuchs: Thanks for your replay. I need a player so I can rewind or forward the movie
[07:47] <cong06> Has anyone here experienced an RSA key change based entirely on an ISP restructure? ie: would an ISP restructure cause a RSA key change over ssh? SSH gives me a warning if the IP changed and the RSA key changed. and this time both have changed. the IP changing is normal. the IP address is dynamic after all... I'm just not sure if I should be worried or not. I realize it's more likely a hardware issue than someone actually being malicious, but I don't want to t
[07:48] <GeneralK> raido, Yeah, I also tried that before... still the same, does not exist :-/
[07:48] <raido> GeneralK: Im lost. Sorry buddy.
[07:48] <Fuchs> Softdroid: try vlc or mplayer
[07:49] <Starminn> Is there an app or a plugin for a media player that will show you the lyrics of the current song playing? For example, Windows Media Player has the option, and so do iPods while something is playing, so is there a pugin or something I could use? Even a separate app dedicated solely to the purpose of showing you a song's lyrics? (I'm using Banshee but others are fine)
[07:49] <Softdroid> Fuchs: vlc can't play the files. But I will try mplayer. Thanks
[07:49] <GeneralK> raido, Ah well. Buggered if I know either. Very frustrating :-/ Thanks for trying though.
[07:50] <raido> GeneralK: np, BTW see this on GPT: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table
[07:51] <qkit> GeneralK: how about running this command "sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda /media/ntfsdrive"
[07:51] <raido> cong06: Your key didnt change, there is just a mismatch between the hash for the IP you had before and the one you have now. Just delete the line in ~/.ssh/known_hosts that contains the old IP reference
[07:52] <GeneralK> qkit, Same response as when we tried before with just the ntfs argument :-/
[07:52] <cong06> raido: except it's set to warn me only if the IP and the RSA key changed.
[07:53] <raido> Are you logging in via ssh keys without a password
[07:53] <cong06> raido: or are you saying that the key is based on the ip? that doesn't make any sense because the ip changes constantly, and this is hte first time I saw it.
[07:53] <cong06> yeah. without a password. auto-logging in: http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/152

[08:13] <Starminn> Softdroid: Certain apps (just by the way they're made) don't play well with various color schemes. For example, Firefox and OpenOffice/LibreOffice are notorious culprits for misbehaving with dark themes.
[08:13] <Softdroid> Starminn: Thanks for your reply. Is it possible to change the themes?
[08:13] <Starminn> Softdroid: While I've seen some fixes every so often I've never tried any of them because to get the normal white back it looks like you'd have to edit it by hand again. I could find them if you want, ubt in general the rule of thumb here is "Don't use dark themes if you need those menus."

[08:17] <ericy> shark1: good luck to you. Have fun.
[08:17] <Starminn> Softdroid: http://imagebin.org/143654 and to change themes just go to System->Preferences->Appearance and choose one.
[08:18] <qkit> Generalk: but your gparted show that the /dev/dm-0p1 is available? but when you run the mount command. It return no such partition?
[08:19] <Softdroid> Starminn: Thanks. You are using dark theme :)
[08:19] <GeneralK> qkit, Oh, cool... there's a gui for parted. :P
[08:19] <shark1> ericy: I'm learning programming
[08:19] <ericy> GeneralK: (I might be joining your conversation/problem very late) but if you can do command line, what do   sfdisk -l     blkid    and    df -h show?
[08:19] <shark1> do you like it
[08:19] <Starminn> Softdroid: Another thing to take ntoe of is when using dark themes (mine doesn't do it because it's a white foreground but the ones that are *really* dark) the icons go into "high contrast" mode in Open/Libre Office.
[08:20] <qkit> :)
[08:20] <ericy> GeneralK:    sfdisk -l      blkid    and    df -h show?
[08:20] <Starminn> Softdroid: Yes, I am. I use Firefox 4 Beta though so the only apps I can't read well are LibreOffice and the logout/Sht Down button
[08:20] <Softdroid> Starminn: Ok, thanks for the info
[08:20] <Starminn> Softdroid: I deal with it. ;) Lol.
[08:20] <GeneralK> ericy, I'll paste dump it all, hold one...
[08:20] <qkit> Generalk: also the ls /dev/mapper ? anything show up?
[08:21] <ericy> GeneralK:  That's 3 separate commands:  sfdisk -l       blkid         df -h
[08:21] <Starminn> Anybody have suggestions for making my media player work again without not responding shortly after launch? This is the error I receive. I installed a plugin for Banshee and now it's doing this. How can I restore it to before the plugin? http://pastebin.com/qCgBycLg

Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[08:29] <GeneralK> ericy, Thanks man, I'll have a look
[08:29] <ericy> antant: I don't know what to think (I've never used samba...).
[08:29] <qkit> Generalk: what you get if you run "sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/dm-0 /media/ntfsdrive"
[08:30] <GeneralK> qkit, NTFS signature is missing. Failed to mount '/dev/dm-0': Invalid argument The device '/dev/dm-0' doesn't seem to have a valid NTFS. Maybe the wrong device is used? Or the whole disk instead of a partition (e.g. /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1)? Or the other way around?

[08:34] <pbear> what's the difference between kernel compiling from the git-tree or via apt-get and from kernel.org??
[08:35] <Starminn> Anybody have suggestions for making my media player work again without not responding shortly after launch? This is the error I receive. http://pastebin.com/qCgBycLg I installed a plugin for Banshee and now it's doing this. How can I restore it to before the plugin?
[08:35] <Sonne> pbear, the git-tree would be the most bleeding edge kernel i'd guess, apt-get would get you the ubuntu patched sources, and kernel.org would get you the lastest stable kernel without patches
[08:36] <ethanol> Starminn: uninstall the plugin?
[08:36] <Starminn> Yeah, how do I do that?
[08:36] <ethanol> Starminn: how did you install it?
[08:36] <Starminn> I navigated to it on my disk and deleted the file but it keeps coming back

[08:38] <Starminn> ethanol: Well I actually just purged Banshee, so if it doesn't work I'll let you know. ;)
[08:38] <Starminn> After I reinstalled it it still had the plugin after I killed the ./.config/banshee-1 folder
[08:38] <Starminn> Ho hum
[08:39] <Sonne> Starminn, if you installed the plugin locally, reinstalling banshee won't help
[08:39] <Starminn> Sonne: After a nice little purge it still is doing it so yeah, I'm discovering that.
[08:39] <Sonne> that goes for everything else as well :)
[08:40] <Sonne> Starminn, if you don't mind reconfiguring it, you might as well just annihilate the configuration whole
[08:41] <Starminn> Sonne: I thought that's what purge did? remove+kill all configs. I tried hand-deleting the configs I could find in /home to no avail
[08:41] <Starminn> I really odn't mind, though. I mean I've already got a lot of hours of crap to do now from uninstalling so I actually would love to start fresh.

[08:45] <ethanol> Starminn: then you will find your plugin there
[08:45] <bazZ061> which port must opened?
[08:45] <Starminn> Sonne: No.
[08:45] <bazZ061> 902 or 22
[08:45] <Sonne> Starminn, then i'm quite surprised it even worked
[08:45] <Sonne> try looking if the plugin is in that directory
[08:45] <bazZ061> and how can i make it more secure?

[08:46] <Sonne> Starminn, i'll ask again
[08:46] <bazZ061> ok
[08:46] <Sonne> did you run *install.sh* with sudo?
[08:46] <bazZ061> but which port ?
[08:46] <bazZ061> 902 or 22?
[08:46] <bazZ061> i have to forweard them also
[08:46] <bazZ061> on my router
[08:46] <Sonne> bazZ061, 22 is the standard port, i don't see why you wouldn't use it :)
[08:46] <gamemakingdude> Hi, i am having trouble of installing ubuntu 10.10 onto my usb.
[08:46] <Starminn> ethanol: Yeah, it's here. I'll delete it and let you know
[08:46] <ethanol> Starminn: though a simple sudo locate Banshee.Lyrics.dll should have given you all locations too
[08:47] <gamemakingdude> Whenever i install it, its the live cd
[08:47] <gamemakingdude> and not a proper version of ubuntu
[08:47] <bazZ061> ok port 22 i have to forward
[08:47] <bazZ061> and which command is it in ubuntu?
[08:47] <bazZ061> i didnt find anything @ google
[08:47] <Starminn> ethanol: "sudo locate Banshee.Lyrics.dll" didn't work even though I'm looking at the file
[08:47] <ethanol> bazhang: iptables for port forwarding
[08:47] <ethanol> Starminn: define "didn't work"
[08:47] <bazZ061> port forwarding is automated in my router
[08:48] <Starminn> ethanol: It returned nothing.
[08:48] <ethanol> Starminn: did you try a sudo updatedb ?
[08:48] <bazZ061> but i have to open the port in my ubuntu machine
[08:48] <Sonne> Starminn, follow me please - did you run the install.sh script with sudo?
[08:48] <gamemakingdude> Ignore me....
[08:48] <ethanol> gamemakingdude: ok :)
[08:49] <gamemakingdude> ...
[08:49] <Starminn> Sonne ethanol: It's working now. I just ran "sudo rm /usr/lib/banshee-1/Banshee.Lyrics.dll" and restarted Banshee. Voila, no issue.
[08:49] <Starminn> Sonne: Are we going to Candy Mountain? Sorry, anyway, yes, I did
[08:50] <ET-0nline> how do i install ssh is it sudo apt-get install ssh
[08:50] <Sonne> Starminn, i missed your candy mountain reference - nevertheless i'm glad you managed to remove it
[08:51] <Sonne> ET-0nline, definitely, yes
[08:51] <Sonne> ET-0nline, the client should be already there though - for the server you might want openssh-server
[08:51] <ET-0nline> sonne: and then if i want a user to connect to my ubuntu ssh how to do that
[08:51] <beer_brouwer> does anyone know a tool to create your own api?
[08:51] <Sonne> ET-0nline, create the user, give it a password, give your ip to your user
[08:51] <Starminn> Sonne: Ah. It was simply one of those lame YouTube videos that gained popularity through some process full of facepalms a few years ago. Old news now. I would link you but it's highly irrelevant. Basically, "YouTube garbage" is a nice summary.
[08:52] <Sonne> Starminn, noted
[08:52] <ET-0nline> how is it to add user is it sudo add user
[08:52] <Starminn> Sonne: Thanks for the help though. If you have time, care to tell me more of this "locate" command? I can see this being very useful.
[08:52] <ethanol> candy mountain was awesome
[08:52] <Sonne> ET-0nline, sudo adduser <username>

[08:53] <Sonne> Starminn, periodically, your system stores a database of all the files you have on your disks (the update is done at some time during the night i believe)
[08:53]  * Starminn tries to prevent the lines of #ubuntu/#ubuntu-offtopic from crossing *cough*ethanol*cough*
[08:53] <Sonne> by launching "locate" you can query that database, and see where a file is

[08:53] <Starminn> ethanol: ah.
[08:53] <gamemakingdude> I have a problem with installing ubuntu on a usb and i do not want it to be the live version!
[08:54] <Sonne> ethanol, why do you tell me that?

[08:55] <bonjoyee> schinken: sudo apt-get install -f
[08:55] <gamemakingdude> Starminn: Live cd.
[08:56] <ethanol> gamemakingdude: then don't install the live version
[08:56] <gamemakingdude> ....
[08:56] <gamemakingdude> I'm not installing it
[08:56] <gamemakingdude> its the pendrive linux that does it
[08:56] <Starminn> gamemakingdude: So you want it to run as a mini computer on the USB? AFAIK the newer Ubuntus don't work on that? Most people go with Damn Small Linux or Puppy Linux anyway, but the newer Ubuntus don't seem to be compatible with Pen Drive Linux according to their sit last I checked

[09:11] <Gartral> Diverdude: severly OT
[09:11] <researcher1> STarminn:YES
[09:11] <researcher1> Starminn:I want same image to be applied to all backgrounds
[09:12] <Starminn> researcher1: Okay. While I'm sure there's probably some way to set the background control file (wherever that is) to load two images with one being dynamic and the other static, I wouldn't knnow where to even find it, hat to do with it once I have it, or if it will even work. Your best bet (and possibly only bet) is to just make a background with the text you want there as a separate file.
[09:13] <Starminn> researcher1: I like what you're trying to do, and if you want to try my earlier suggestion go for it as I see that as the only possible "hope" but I really wouldn't know what to tell you.
[09:13] <Diverdude> Gartral, come on, its ok
[09:13] <researcher1> Starminn:But I will have to edit each background and save it?
[09:14] <Starminn> Diverdude: Why is it that every time I'm on here somebody's lecturing you for being off-topic?
[09:14] <Starminn> researcher1: Yes. So, for example, open it up in GIMP and just add a text box there, save it as a different name (so you save the original) and set it as your background.
[09:14] <researcher1> Starminn:ok .workable idea.thanks
[09:15] <Diverdude> Starminn, Maybe you are just completely out of touch with reality mate
[09:15] <quietone> I've been trying what I can find in the forums. But still no wifi.
[09:16] <Starminn> researcher1: Sure thing. By the way, not sure if you know this or not, but backgrounds don't have to be in /usr/share/backgrounds to work. They can be anywhere. So to prevent accidentally overwriting stuff I'd save it in /home/yourUSERNAME/somewhere
[09:16] <ericy> fedora_newb: I am using XChat 2.8.8.  I will tell you that you can configure any servers and multiple channels to automatically open.
[09:16] <Starminn> Diverdude: In soviet Russia, reality touch you.
[09:16] <researcher1> starminn:OK
[09:16] <Starminn> :)
[09:16] <quietone> anyone able to help get wifi working?

[09:39] <Quintin> hrm... over 200 processes running.  seems very excessive for a desktop
[09:39] <linuxuz3r> hey quintin do you know why ubuntu iso image says amd64
[09:39] <ana_> pixum.com
[09:39] <linuxuz3r> not general x86_64
[09:39] <ericy> ana_: Is Pixum software in the Ubuntu repo?
[09:39] <ana_> I try it in windows without problems
[09:39] <ana_> no
[09:39] <ana_> no repo
[09:40] <linux_wd> HELLO!
[09:40] <ana_> is not possible to install out ubuntu repos?
[09:40] <ana_> I never runs anything not in the repos
[09:40] <ericy> ana_: Is Pixum a windows program that came with your camera or printer?
[09:40] <ana_> nono
[09:40] <ana_> is linux native
[09:40] <ericy> ana_: ok
[09:41] <ana_> http://www.pixum.co.uk/fotobook/download/id/94
[09:41] <ana_> that
[09:41] <Gnea> ana_: usually there's a variant of what you're looking for in the repositories, but if not, you should be able to compile if it comes to that
[09:42] <fedora_newb> Why isn't there OPs in this room? It could really use some for the trolls.
[09:42] <Gnea> fedora_newb: what's the problem?
[09:42] <Quintin> linuxuz3r: hmm?  why?
[09:42] <ghosthn2010> hello
[09:42] <ana_> that software is very near to hofmann
[09:42] <fedora_newb> Gnea, just rude people in chat ;)
[09:42] <linuxuz3r> Quintin, i was just wondering
[09:43] <ana_> others no
[09:43] <Gnea> fedora_newb: no worries :)
[09:43] <AdvoWork> ive got a bit of perl script, im trying to run/pipe a program through, any ideas please? would it just  be cat file.txt | perlcode > outputfile ? i tried that but it didnt appear to do anything
[09:43] <linuxuz3r> in fedora it says x86_64
[09:43] <linuxuz3r> but ubuntu and debian the iso is amd64
[09:43] <Gnea> !amd64
[09:43] <ubottu> AMD64 and Intel 64 are fully supported architectures on Ubuntu. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions#AMD64%20Processors and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64 for more information.
[09:44] <ana_> well
[09:44] <Quintin> well, most compilers produce binaries that are compatible with both architecture.  I think amd was the first to have popular consumer 64 bit cpu, so it might be related to that
[09:44] <ghosthn2010> 17:41:12
[09:44] <ana_> I wait pixum support mail xD
[09:45] <Gnea> ana_: what's the problem you're having, exactly?

[09:47] <krishna> yes
[09:47] <overclucker> s/sdtin/stdin/
[09:48] <AdvoWork> overclucker, cant i do it from the CLI? the script is like: perl -MEncode -pe 'use bytes; sub c { my $d = decode("UTF-8",shift,Encode::FB_XMLCREF); $d =~ s/&#x(..);/decode("windows-1252",chr(hex($1)))/eg; $d } s/([\x80-\xFF]+)/encode("UTF-8",c($1))/eg'

[09:49] <krishna> i need y messenger
[09:49] <krishna> can u help ?

[09:50] <DJones> krishna: Yahoo messenger? You can connect to yahoo accounts for chat using pidgin or empathy, although from memory, they don't support video chat
[09:50] <Gnea> ericy: ah, okay - well we support Ubuntu here, Lubuntu support is in #lubuntu, and from what I can tell, it's just a perl script to install it, so it should "just work" if you type ./install.pl
[09:50] <krishna> can u help ?

[09:51] <linuxuz3r> is the next release of ubuntu LTS?
[09:51] <ana_> yes, y make ./install.pl

[09:51] <Gnea> linuxuz3r: I would say 'no'
[09:51] <ana_> install ok
[09:51] <DJones> linuxuz3r: I think 12.04 is the next LTS
[09:51] <linuxuz3r> gnea ok
[09:51] <ana_> but program not run
[09:51] <ericy> ana_: It appears that maybe when you installed, You should specify "/home/ana/"  not "/home/ana/Pixum/".
[09:52] <Gnea> ana_: okay, I'm installing it now
[09:52] <ericy> ana_: It appears that maybe when you installed, You should specify "/home/ana/"  not "/home/ana/Pixum/".

[09:54] <overclucker> AdvoWork: yes, you should be able to pipe that alright. cat file.txt | perlcode > out.txt

[10:06] <mirshafie> and by the way, I do not have a laptop, so I don't need Ubuntu to check the battery state. if that helps...
[10:06] <ana_> downloading many archives
[10:06] <Gnea> ana_: now type the following:  cd ~/Pixum
[10:06] <vivek200912> Gnea: Its have cost.
[10:06] <ana_> when finish installation
[10:07] <Gnea> ana_: then:  cd Pixum\ Photo\ Book
[10:07] <Gnea> ana_: yes, after installation is finished
[10:07] <ana_> ok
[10:07] <ana_> thanks for your help
[10:07] <zvacet> vivek200912: you have to pay for cedega
[10:07] <Gnea> vivek200912: yes, it's not free, but it's not expensive. not everything is without cost.
[10:07] <Gnea> vivek200912: ubuntu is free, therefore less cost to play such games shouldn't be a problem.
[10:08] <Gnea> ana_: you're welcome
[10:08] <ana_> Pixum installed, no errors. now say: to run program click on /home/ana/Pixum/Pixum Easy book
[10:08] <vivek200912> Gnea, zvacet: yes, obiviously, and not much prise only $5 per month which is good to buy..
[10:08] <Gnea> ana_: yes, that's the problem.
[10:08] <shlorine> hey, I cant start up xfce4 for some reason =/ xf86OpenConsole: Cannot open /dev/tty0 (No such file or directory)
[10:09] <zvacet> vivek200912: so go for it
[10:09] <ana_> :S ???
[10:09] <Gnea> vivek200912: exactly - make sure you check the compatibility list to make sure your game works with it before buying
[10:09] <Gnea> ana_: you have to type:  cd Pixum, then cd Pixum\ Photo\ Book
[10:09] <Gnea> ana_: then type:  ./Pixum\ Photo\ Book
[10:09] <vivek200912> zvacet,Gnea: thanks..
[10:11] <ana_> I don't have Pixum\Photo\book :S
[10:11] <iqpi> ana_: notice the spaces
=== ogra is now known as Guest78603
[10:12] <Gnea> ana_: the \ are to escape spaces on the commandline
[10:12] <ericy> Gnea: ana_: You are making me dizzy with all of those forward slashes, back slashes and spaces!
[10:12] <shlorine> Could anyone help me with something?, I cant get xfce to boot up for some reason
=== Guest78603 is now known as ogra_
[10:12] <ana_> mmm
[10:12] <ana_> well
[10:12] <Gnea> ericy: feel free to focus on something else :)
[10:12] <iqpi> shlorine: how do you have tried to boot xfce?
[10:12] <ana_> I I'm in terminal in /Pixum
[10:13] <Gnea> ana_: yes, and if you type:  cd Pixum<tab>   where <tab> is the tab key, you'll see why the \ is necessary
[10:13] <shlorine> iqpi just by using the startxfce4 cmd
[10:13] <ana_> sorry I don't understand
[10:14] <ana_> I install it in /home/ana/Pixum
[10:14] <ericy> Gnea: ana_: Well as I said in an earlier post!: Spaces in file and directory names are evil!
[10:14] <Gnea> ericy: that doesn't help solve the problem.
[10:14] <ana_> ericy shut up please
[10:14] <Fuwex> Hi. I need a simple, yet good-looking panel that works with Compiz to only show a taskbar, meaning only open windows. No other buttons. Any suggestions?
[10:14] <Gnea> lol
[10:14] <zvacet> shlorine: why do you want to start from cli
[10:14] <iqpi> perhaps its because you are trying to start it from gnome?
[10:14] <Gnea> ana_: let's just take this step-by-step and it will work, okay?
[10:15] <ana_> ok
[10:15] <ericy> Gnea: rudness
[10:15] <ana_> I reinstall again
[10:15] <Gnea> ericy: enough.
[10:15] <Gnea> ana_: okay
[10:15] <Gnea> ana_: let me know when you are ready
[10:15] <ana_> in install no change anything?
[10:16] <Gnea> ana_: correct.
[10:16] <ericy> Gnea: I'm listening too.
[10:16] <Gnea> ericy: please do.
[10:17] <ana_> now the text is in english :S
[10:19] <Gnea> ana_: okay, can you cd Pixum/Pixum\ Photo\ Book/
[10:21] <ana_> WOW
[10:21] <ana_> now it runs!
[10:21] <ana_> but in english xD
[10:21] <ana_> I try again in spanish version
[10:22] <ana_> is strange that
[10:22] <ana_> :S
[10:22] <ana_> english version ok

[10:28] <erry> Hi
[10:28] <erry> Im trying to update and all im getting is 0% [Waiting for headers]
[10:29] <erry> Quite a while now
[10:29] <et-0nline> hey whats the command line when somebody ssh logs and i want to see what he does on my box
[10:29] <lathan_devers> ana_, try asking at the spanish irc channel #ubuntu-es
[10:30] <ana_> no
[10:30] <ejv> et-0nline: they need to have a screen active, then you'd screen -x
[10:30] <ana_> is a program error
[10:30] <ana_> nothing to do
=== ariana is now known as Phrul
[10:31] <erry> Is there a problem with the update servers?
[10:31] <ejv> i believe people are having difficulty communicating with you ana_ , you should try asking in the #ubuntu-es channel in your native language. :)
[10:31] <zvacet> erry: try to change server and see if that works
[10:32] <erry> zvacet, is there a way to know which server is the problem?
[10:32] <erry> I use ubuntu.otenet.gr and badgerports.org
[10:33] <zvacet> erry: under ubuntu software center>edit>software repositories change from one you use now to main and see
[10:33] <erry> Where's ubuntu software center?
[10:33] <Neosano> hello guys, I'm going to install ubuntu ON usb. Why can't I simply boot from cd and install it to usb exactly the same way I install ubuntu on my hard drive?
[10:33] <erry> I'm on 10.04 lts
[10:34] <zvacet> erry: under applications
[10:34] <iqpi> Neosano: you can do as you say, i have done it but with debian
[10:34] <erry> Oh that
[10:34] <erry> never used it
[10:34] <linuxuz3r> i saw a xoom tablet today and its something
[10:34] <linuxuz3r> smaller than an ipad
[10:34] <Neosano> iqpi, oh, right. Just wanted to be sure, thanks
[10:35] <iqpi> Neosano: just be sure to select the correct drive
[10:35] <iqpi> and also when you are going to install grub
[10:35] <erry> zvacet, stuill 0% waiting for heeaders
[10:35] <iqpi> install it in the pendrive, and not in other harddisk
[10:36] <zvacet> erry:  sorry I don't know
[10:36] <Neosano> iqpi, OK. uhhmm, more questions came to my mind :)
[10:36] <erry> maybe badgerports is the prob
[10:36] <Neosano> iqpi, is it possible to install more than 1 distrib on a pendrive?
[10:37] <iqpi> Neosano: of course yes
[10:37] <erry> Yep
[10:37] <erry> That was the prob
[10:37] <Neosano> iqpi, and is it possible to resize partitions on the pendrive like I usually do on my hdd?
[10:37] <zvacet> erry:  so you solved it?
[10:37] <iqpi> Neosano: yes, no problem, just make the partitions as if it will be a standart hd
[10:38] <Neosano> iqpi, awesome :O thanks
[10:38] <erry> zvacet, yes ty
[10:38] <erry> :)
[10:38] <azizLIGHTS> how do i make a new user  called 'dropbox'
[10:38] <Ben64> adduser dropbox
[10:38] <zvacet> erry:  glad to hear that  :)
[10:38] <gamemakingdude> Ubuntu is now installing on my 8gb usb.
[10:38] <iqpi> only one thin Neosano
[10:39] <boota2> hello, I can't access webmin form the internet, works from localhost from root
[10:39] <iqpi> Neosano: i dont advice you to use ext3 or ext4
[10:39] <Fripon> Hi ! I modified keys in /etc/kde/kdm/kdmrc but changes are ignored, did I miss something?
[10:39] <boota2> anyone had experience with it?
[10:39] <Ben64> usb flash drives are really slow, i don't recommend them for an OS
[10:39] <iqpi> Neosano: because of journaling
[10:39] <mirshafie> ok i take it no one here is familiar with the ubuntu boot sequence. bye
[10:39] <Neosano> iqpi, :O
[10:39] <Neosano> iqpi, what should I use then?
[10:40] <azizLIGHTS> how do i become the new user 'dropbox'
[10:40] <Ben64> ext2, still gonna be slow though
[10:40] <iqpi> Neosano: i think ext2 is the best, or parse a option to ext4 to disable journaling, and i dont know how to do that xD
[10:40] <Neosano> Ben64, not for everyday use, of course! but for trying linux out and doing recovery things!
[10:40] <Sonne> azizLIGHTS, su dropbox
[10:40] <Sysi> !webmin | boota2
[10:40] <ubottu> boota2: webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. It is not compatible with the way that Ubuntu packages handle configuration files, and is likely to cause unexpected issues with your system.
[10:41] <boota2> I have old ubuntu.
[10:41] <boota2> 8.4
[10:41] <Sonne> Neosano, just out of curiosity, why do you want a filesystem without journaling?
[10:41] <neurochrome> Is anyone else getting weird screen artefacts in Ubuntu.  If I have an app open in the foreground I always see either youtube videos or adverts for amazon come through from the background, even when a browser is minimised or closed altogether
[10:41] <neurochrome> the only way to get rid of it is to restart
[10:41] <neurochrome> this is a new problem, started at 10.10
[10:41] <neurochrome> any ideas?
[10:41] <Sonne> neurochrome, few other people are reporting the same issue - it's most probably due to the video drivers
[10:42] <Sysi> Sonne: it's better when using usb drive, less writing to it
[10:42] <Sonne> Sysi, aha
[10:42] <mushrooms> Hi all, I have used ubuntu in the past (like version 6 or something) but gave up, and decided that I would give it another go today with version 10.
[10:42] <neurochrome> Sonne, even switching between metacity/compiz/ emerald/gtk-win-dec doesn;t help
[10:42] <neurochrome> strange
[10:42] <ylmfos> dd
[10:42] <Sonne> neurochrome, those are window managers, not video drivers :P
[10:42] <neurochrome> Sonne, no fix?
[10:42] <neurochrome> Sonne,  yeah I know
[10:42] <Ben64> neurochrome: have you tried disabling hardware accel for flash
[10:42] <Sysi> it's issue with flash
[10:43] <ylmfos> yundao
[10:43] <mushrooms> But I need help setting up my wireless card, more specifically... It doesn't seem to turn 'on' when I boot up
[10:43] <neurochrome> No, I haven't
[10:43] <Sonne> neurochrome, the proprietary flash plugin uses some kind of weird acceleration that causes problems on certain drivers, you might want to try switching to some alternatives
[10:43] <ylmfos> what is this?
[10:43] <Sonne> neurochrome, for example, you  might consider trying the proprietary drivers
[10:43] <Neosano> iqpi, oh, and really, what's wrong with journaling?
[10:43] <neurochrome> There is a way to disable hw accel though, I'll look into it
[10:43] <neurochrome> Sonne, prop drivers for what?
[10:43] <neurochrome> GFX?
[10:43] <neurochrome> already do
[10:43] <Sonne> neurochrome, for your video card
[10:43] <DJones> ylmfos: This a a support channel for the ubuntu operating system
[10:43] <Sonne> ah, nice
[10:43] <olie> hi
[10:43] <Sysi> Neosano: more writing to disc
[10:44] <ylmfos> eeee
[10:44] <iqpi> Neosano: journaling makes many write cycles to the disks to dont loose data in a crash
[10:44] <GeneralK> Just in case there is anyone different around now, I am having an issue where I'm unable to mount a NTFS partition on a drive that has a gpt partition table... it's also connected through a nvidia raid array. Any help would be appreciated
[10:44] <neurochrome> Sonne,  not that I like prop stuff, but I like my gfx with a kick up the ass
[10:44] <Ben64> neurochrome: try disabling hardware accel for flash first :D right click flash vid -> settings -> uncheck box for accel
[10:44] <ylmfos> i m first use it
[10:44] <iqpi> Neosano: so it will destroy your pendrive
[10:44] <Sonne> neurochrome, i know what you mean, i run proprietary drivers as well - but your issue appears often when using the free ones
[10:44] <iqpi> Neosano: because pendrives are designed to support a limit of IO cycles
[10:44] <neurochrome> Ben64, cheers 2sec, I thought there was a cfg file somewhere to switch it on/off
[10:45] <ylmfos> where are u?
[10:45] <Sysi> Ben64: i'd tried that but my settings aren't working either..
[10:45] <mushrooms> when I type in, lshw -C network, and it shows up with an entry "*-network UNCLAIMED" what does this mean?
[10:45] <Fripon> Hi ! I modified keys in /etc/kde/kdm/kdmrc but changes are ignored, did I miss something?
[10:45] <Neosano> iqpi, oh :O
[10:45] <ericy> Have you seen the channel list.  Do it. Filter it for channels with over 300 users.
[10:45] <Ben64> Sysi: huh? i didn't say anything for you to do?
[10:45] <zvacet> yimfos: do you have any question
[10:46] <Sonne> GeneralK, i'm not familiar with your setup - you might want to try #ubuntu-server however
[10:46] <Sysi> Ben64: throws to adobe website
[10:46] <Neosano> iqpi, hmm.. ok.. but then what's going to happen if I pull my usb out while the system is doing something?
[10:46] <Sysi> Fripon: you could try to ask from #kubuntu
[10:47] <Sysi> Neosano: unclean mount, not good for journalized fs:es either
[10:47] <gazzumatteo> :/quit
[10:47] <azizLIGHTS> how do i give the new user dropbox, ability to read/write my home dir? /home/ubuntu
[10:48] <iqpi> Neosano: i dont know, but the same that if while you are working with the system, you disconnect the hard drive, your system will crash
[10:48] <Sonne> azizLIGHTS, you could try adding the dropbox user to your group - but why are you using a dedicated user for dropbox?
[10:48] <iqpi> Neosano: I think it will become freeze
[10:48] <iqpi> and you will cannot do anything, just hardreboot
[10:48] <Fripon> Sysi thx
[10:48] <mushrooms> How do I check if a particular driver in question is bound to a device, and talking to the kernel?
[10:49] <azizLIGHTS> Sonne: because i tried with my own user and it does funny things when i try to share /home/ubuntu to other dropbox users
[10:49] <Sysi> mushrooms: lspci -k
[10:49] <Sonne> azizLIGHTS, using a different user won't change anything
[10:49] <Sysi> for a start
[10:49] <Neosano> iqpi, I mean would it broke the filesystem so I'd have to format it?
[10:49] <Sonne> that's the way fuse woks i guess
[10:49] <mushrooms> Sysi: so if it's listed, then a driver should be installed?
[10:50] <fedora_newb> mushrooms, it will list the driver its using
[10:50] <azizLIGHTS> Sonne: it tries to sync /home/ubuntu/.dropbox which has socket files and goes 100% cpu usage, if i exclude it , it deltes it and my db disappears, if i recreate it, and then try to share /home/ubuntu it makes a .dropbpx (Conflicted Copy) dir
[10:50] <azizLIGHTS> Sonne: its funny businmess!
[10:50] <azizLIGHTS> Sonne: im going to isolate the .dropbox dir into a new user, and not share that user's home. and keep my own home safe from that crap and able to be shared
[10:50] <chasis> hi, i need a linux alternative for avisub detector, any help?
[10:50] <mushrooms> fedora_newb: oh ok (sorry I'm not an advanced user.. so...) I'm trying to get my wireless card working with ubuntu :(
[10:50] <death_> <unconvertable> <unconvertable>
[10:51] <Sonne> azizLIGHTS, that doesn't really look like a good choice, but have fun experimenting :)
[10:51] <fedora_newb> mushrooms, i had trouble with mine as well, however did you try connecting it to a wired connection and then checking for additional drivers with ubuntu online?
[10:51] <DJones> !ru | death_
[10:51] <ubottu> death_: <unconvertable> <unconvertable> #ubuntu-ru <unconvertable> <unconvertable> <unconvertable> <unconvertable> <unconvertable> <unconvertable>  / Pozhalujsta posetite /join #ubuntu-ru dlya polucheniya pomoshi na russkom yazyke
[10:51] <fedora_newb> mushrooms, it fixed mine right up with that method
[10:52] <azizLIGHTS> so how do i add 'dropbox' to my group?
[10:52] <fedora_newb> mushrooms, system->administration->additional drivers
[10:52] <mushrooms> fedora_newb: yes, i am connected via wire at the moment, and then i connected it to the 'restricted drivers', it said that system doesn't have any..
[10:52] <fedora_newb> oh
[10:52] <iqpi> Neosano: i dont know what will happen
[10:52] <iqpi> but i dont think you will have any problem, but you will loose whatever you have not saved before
[10:52] <fedora_newb> mushrooms, you made sure your wifi is on?
[10:52] <mushrooms> fedora_newb: then... my wireless card is one of those ones where i insert into the PCI slot on my laptop. it won't light up either..
[10:52] <Neosano> ok..
[10:53] <Neosano> and..
[10:53] <azizLIGHTS> !group
[10:53] <azizLIGHTS> !groups
[10:53] <Sonne> azizLIGHTS, adduser dropbox ubuntu
[10:53] <chasis> any help with avisub detector for linux?
[10:53] <mushrooms> fedora_newb: ^^;;; actually i don't know how to turn it on in ubuntu..
[10:53] <Sonne> (if that's your username)
[10:53] <zvacet> mushrooms:  read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs and see if it helps
[10:53] <mushrooms> zvacet: yeah i'm reading that at the moment now too
[10:53] <Neosano> iqpi, I want the free space of the pendrive to be shared for all os'es on my pendrive, how to do that?
[10:53] <Sysi> mushrooms: should be bios setting
[10:53] <azizLIGHTS> Sonne what about the permissions of /home/ubuntu dir? do i have to set it
[10:53] <zvacet> mushrooms: ok then
[10:53] <sougata> mushrooms: whats your network card ?
[10:53] <fedora_newb> mushrooms, i would do what zvacet recommended...i am of no help from here, sorry
[10:53] <mushrooms> zvacet: i was trying to figure out if the lshw -C network command meant anything :(
[10:54] <Sonne> azizLIGHTS, if anything, chmod g+w
[10:54] <jrn_a> mushrooms, look for the ubuntu netbook versions / it's extra packages
[10:54] <neurochrome> Ben64, the settings is greyed out, and global settings takes me to adobe.com
[10:54] <Sonne> if you wanna write to it, that is
[10:54] <mushrooms> sougata: I have no idea >_< how do i tell? (i don't have the driver disc, nor do i have the original box)
[10:54] <azizLIGHTS> yes
[10:54] <iqpi> Neosano: just make a partition with the free space, and format it to fat32
[10:54] <azizLIGHTS> do i do adduser dropbox ubuntu, as ubuntu or as dropbox user
[10:54] <Sonne> adduser <dropbox user> <your user>
[10:54] <iqpi> then make a fstab rule to mount that partition for example in /pendrive
[10:54] <azizLIGHTS> yes but as who?
[10:54] <sougata> mushrooms: so what was the output for lshw -C network ?
[10:55] <Ben64> neurochrome: try it on a youtube vid?
[10:55] <mushrooms> sougata: hang on i'll paste it in a pastebin
[10:55] <neurochrome> yeah, that's where I am
[10:55] <sougata> mushrooms: cool
[10:55] <Neosano> iqpi, no, I mean..  I don't want to create 2 partitions for 2 different os'es, how can I install them on one? :O
[10:55] <Ben64> neurochrome: well thats grayed for me too... hold on
[10:56] <Neosano> iqpi, simply different root directory?
[10:56] <zvacet> Neosano: you can not install two os on same partition
[10:56] <neurochrome> Ben64, k
[10:56] <iqpi> Neosano: you need at least one partition for each / so, you cannot install 2 systems in one partition
[10:56] <mushrooms> sougata: http://paste.ubuntu.com/582022/
[10:56] <Neosano> that doesn't sound good XD
[10:56] <azizLIGHTS> Sonne: what about files in /home/ubuntu/* shouldnt those be g+w too?
[10:56] <neurochrome> Ben64, think I found the text file to edit /etc/adobe/mms.cfg
[10:57] <iqpi> Neosano: there is a posibilite
[10:57] <Sonne> azizLIGHTS, aye most probably
[10:57] <Ben64> neurochrome: :O
[10:57] <neurochrome> Ben64, but it doesn't exist, does flash have hw accel on by default?
[10:57] <iqpi> but you will need to use first a different partition
[10:57] <Ben64> http://ben64.com/panda/test1.html
[10:57] <Ben64> neurochrome: go there, right click, settings :D
[10:58] <neurochrome> Ben64, nice one!
[10:58] <Sysi> best workaround ever
[10:58] <Ben64> worth a shot, i was having problems with accel on
[10:59] <neurochrome> Ben64, the artefacts are still there, but I'll restart to see if it's fixed.... or is there another way to kill the programs running w/o restarting?
[10:59] <sougata> mushrooms: hang on a while
[10:59] <mushrooms> sougata: so i was wondering what "unclaimed" means... and if there were any way of actually enabling the wifi card...
[10:59] <mushrooms> sougata:  ya
[10:59] <iqpi> Neosano: you can first install both systems, in diferent partitions, then from one of the system, as root, you copy the whole root directoy of the other system into a directory of your system. Then when it is entired copied, you can chroot in the new folder, so it will be like using a diferent system into your system.
[10:59] <Ben64> neurochrome: logging out would work, but if it didn't fix it, then that probably won't with a restart either
[10:59] <iqpi> Neosano: and if it works, then destroy the partition

[11:00] <Neosano> something XD
[11:01] <iqpi> but, you first install as many systems as you want in different partitions
[11:01] <Ben64> wow
[11:01] <iqpi> Neosano: and after that
[11:01] <Sysi> Ben64: mine started working when i took acceleration off, thanks
[11:01] <iqpi> Neosano: you have to copy each / of each system into diferent folders of the system you want to have as "master"
[11:02] <iqpi> and then, for using those "client" systems
[11:02] <Ben64> Sysi: cool
[11:02] <iqpi> Neosano:  you can chroot to the folder of the system.
[11:02] <iqpi> Neosano: i don't know if i have explain

[11:03] <azizLIGHTS> how do i make it so new files made in /home/ubuntu by ubuntu user are g+w by default upon creation
[11:03] <mushrooms> sougata: oh ok, so what should I do from here?
[11:03] <sougata> mushrooms: just hang on
[11:03] <mushrooms> sougata: no problem
[11:04] <sougata> mushrooms: http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers
[11:04] <sougata> mushrooms: we have to match the vendor and the product id
[11:04] <sougata> mushrooms: Then we can get the driver.
[11:05] <mushrooms> sougata: oh ok, so it's that texas instruments one?
[11:05] <Fripon> Hi ! I modified keys in /etc/kde/kdm/kdmrc but changes are ignored, did I miss something?
[11:06] <Neosano> iqpi, but that would require some more brainfuck with grub :O
[11:06] <Neosano> iqpi, hmm okay thanks!
[11:07] <iqpi> Not really, in fact you wont need grub because you only have to boot one linux, and the others should "boot" from that linux
[11:07] <iqpi> but Neosano thats fucking hard work make the partitions
[11:08] <Neosano> iqpi, >.< ok
[11:08] <Neosano> iqpi, thanks!

[11:10] <mushrooms> sougata: D: it didn't work..
[11:10] <sougata> mushrooms: so what did you install

[12:05] <j_ayen_green> arrrrgh!! the past week or two lucid has been going into some race condition on me. last night it was while using thunderbird. asked it to delete about a dozen imap messages, and the disk took off for about 30 minutes, and then the disk stopped and cpu was pegged and memory way up there. Went to sleep and 7 hours later was the same.
[12:05] <mtlife> Fuwex: i think so...
[12:06] <Fuwex> mtlife: OK, thanks

[12:06] <Fuwex> overclucker: thanks - though, is this list updated?
[12:07] <j_ayen_green> mtlife, for what it's worth...I've had to abort a few times recently which left the volume not being usable for init...I found that booting from riplinux let me do a fsck -y every time and fix it.
[12:08] <osse> overclucker, thanks! That will work nicely

[12:10] <overclucker> Fuwex: not sure how updated it is, but it's got all teh big names, and a comprehensive list of you click others
[12:10] <j_ayen_green> mtlife: i could not do it from ubuntu, because gnome would try to mount and leave the disk showing as mounted when it failed, and fsck wouldn't run
[12:10] <j_ayen_green> hence using riplinux
[12:10] <Pici> Laurenceb_: installing the build-essential package should get everything setup for compiling software (minus any specific build-dependencies that packages have)

[12:30] <confoocious> Hello. I can't mount my Motorola L9(on storage) mode via USB. The phone shows up fine as /dev/sdb when plugged in. But it says unknown device, unable to mount when I try to mount it.

[12:32] <lampe2> hallo when i start ubuntu and after login i must type in 4 times the key password can some one help me to fix this?
=== lance is now known as Guest70646
[12:34] <geirha> lampe2: That probably means you are typing the keyring password wrong three times, so it falls back to ask you the password for your wireless network instead, which is the password you just typed three times.

[12:35] <lampe2> geirha,  no i type it right and i dont even got wlan iam on kabel ;) it tested it now 5 times when i start ubnutu
[12:36] <geirha> lampe2: Hm. I see. Not sure then. If you don't have too many passwords stored in your keyring, I'd consider wiping it and create a new keyring.
[12:37] <geirha> lampe2: I'm not on an Ubuntu machine atm, but you'd go to System -> Preferences -> Encryption keys and passwords (IIRC) to do that.
[12:38] <lampe2> geirha, iam there and i got there 7 entries some for ubuntu one and gwibber and gmail can i delte them?
=== Guest70646 is now known as lance--_--
[12:39] <geirha> lampe2: Well, I hope you remember the passwords for those?
[12:39] <Dave105> ok i was trying to follow that guide BUT both download links are broken. so obviously i cant do anything with it!
[12:39] <lampe2> yes i do ;)
[12:39] <Dave105> any ideas?
[12:39] <lampe2> geirha,  yes i remeber all of them ;)
[12:39] <lampe2> geirha, so i can just delete them?
[12:40] <geirha> lampe2: Then it shouldn't be dangerous. If you remove the keyring, and create a new, default one,  you'll have to add those passwords again, one by one of course.
[12:40] <Fripon> Hi ! I modified keys in /etc/kde/kdm/kdmrc but changes are ignored, did I miss something?
[12:40] <Abhijit> hi
[12:40] <Abhijit> help. how to add .bin executable application to application menu/
[12:40] <Abhijit> ?
[12:40] <Dave105> ubuntu is detecting it. but for some reason its not working
[12:41] <Neosano> Hello guys. Still can't believe there's no solution for this: I have a USB flash drive and I'd like to install several linux distributions on it, the problem is that I don't want to use fixed size partitions because my pen drive isn't so big and I don't want the space to be wasted on another partition (and I don't want to resize them from time to time). Is there any way to install everything on one partition? Maybe there's something like a
[12:41] <Neosano>  virtual file system? Or anything else?

[12:41] <ruan> Abhijit: i think you'll need to make a small bash script for that
[12:41] <ruan> not sure
[12:42] <Neosano> Abhijit try menu editor?
[12:42] <Ploploploop> Hello all . I have an interesting porblem. I can't gain access to my computer (obviously not his one) for an apparently stupid reason. When the computer finish his boot, he won't show the space to enter my password. But here is he trick. If I try ctrl alt F1, the screen shut. If I try to boot in safe mode, the computer cracsh after loading the usb port and an live usb start fail with getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (
[12:42] <Ploploploop> 0). I checked the md5sum of he iso and it's good, beside the problems started after I did he first upgrade, not right after the installation. Dos someone have an idea?
[12:42] <Abhijit> Neosano, yes. it added menu entry. but that application dont run when click on it
[12:42] <Dave105> thanks bazhang looks legit that link. going to try it now
[12:42] <Abhijit> ruan, hmm
[12:42] <bazhang> Abhijit, what package
[12:42] <inveratulo> you can trust bazhang's links... mostly
[12:43] <Abhijit> bazhang, eternal land game
[12:43] <lampe2> geirha, thx for help
[12:43] <ruan> Abhijit: ./file.bin, add it to main menu
[12:43] <Neosano> Ploploploop, have you tried ctrl+alt+F1 to get the console?
[12:43] <Abhijit> bazhang, i need to go to terminal and to ./game.bin then only it run. it dont run from menu entry. that entry i added manualy ru
[12:43] <Abhijit> ruan, ^^
[12:44] <[segfault]> Ploploploop: So you are unable to boot into live USB?  Can you use a live CD instead to get into it?
[12:44] <ruan> Abhijit: use a bash script to do ./game.bin
[12:44] <ruan> Abhijit: and add that script to main menu
[12:44] <Abhijit> ohhh
[12:44] <Abhijit> ok

[12:45] <bazhang> Abhijit, just use the ppa
[12:45] <Abhijit> bazhang, ok
[12:45] <[segfault]> Ploploploop: After boot, you can also try alt-sysrq-k to try to get back to a console.  it should kill the x server.  You may have to do the ctrl-alt-f1 first to get to a console (even if it appears blank), then do the alt-sysrq-k.

[12:49] <bazhang> Ploploploop, the prntscrn button usually
[12:49] <[segfault]> Ploploploop: if not so marked on your keyboard, it would also be the same key as print-screen

[12:50] <Dave105> bazhang its weird mate!! :(
[12:50] <Ploploploop> [segfault], it crashed
[12:51] <bazhang> Dave105, looks like you have two wireless nics there
[12:51] <Ploploploop> I have a few with point on scrren , and the cursor, frozen
[12:51] <[segfault]> Ploploploop: can you boot off of a live CD instead, so that you can repair things?
[12:52] <Dave105> bazhang. yes im using my brothers because mines not working. mine is wlan1
[12:52] <Ploploploop> I tried that (liveusb as I have no cddrive) and I got  getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (

[12:53] <Dave105> bazhang the other one was easy to install
[12:53] <Ploploploop> any other idea?
[12:53] <bazhang> Dave105, why not continue to use it then
[12:54] <[segfault]> Ploploploop: hmm..well, since you already checked the MD5 checksum, the USB image seems good... maybe you are experiencing a hardware issue?  You might check your bios settings and refresh them for starters, maybe reseat the ram, check connections.
[12:55] <Dave105> bazhang because my brothers needs it a lot. because he travels a lot. i used ubuntu before but i decided to give it a go again, but with this adapter im not having any luck
[12:55] <bazhang> Dave105, well there are lots of fixes for it in the ubuntu forums, but they do involve some compiling and such.
[12:56] <bazhang> Dave105, its simply not  a  well supported card at all
[12:56] <Ploploploop> [segfault],  Yeah...
[12:56] <EClaesson> A little newbie question. In windows you can use "start programname" to lauch the program but not in the current terminal. How do i do this in ubuntu? I.e i start emacs from terminal but i can continue using that same terminal window
