[18:38] <ikonia> Tyler: I would suggest pressing "e" as you have said you can do and remove the "splash" option from the boot line and see if you get more info
[18:39] <Tyler> okay, afk while I try that

[18:42] <wilee-nilee> mic__, So you wanted to see other discs or partitions, you just have ubuntu, any plugged externals would show in the left panel of home.

[18:43] <mic__> yes correct, if i plug in a usb data stick it shows up
[18:43] <ax562> question: does firefox22 exist for arm based ubuntu systems?
[18:44] <mic__> but hard drives neither primary nor 2nd physical drive show up
[18:44] <ax562> or any other recent firefox releases?
[18:44] <mic__> however i can access my file system via home icon
[18:44] <wilee-nilee> mic__, Does the computer have more than one HD?
[18:44] <mic__> never

[18:46] <wilee-nilee> mic__, Where?
[18:46] <Tyler> Ikonia: how do I remove the splash option? I have a screen with several different boot options. when ever I try anything, it does some weird stuff on the tv the gives me a black screen and a command line
[18:46] <mic__> sorry dont understand
[18:46] <wheatthin> mic__, when you format them, try labling them differently
[18:46] <mic__> could do, hang on
[18:46] <trism> ax562: it builds for armhf
[18:46] <JustM0Bin> hey guys i just reinstalled 12.04 LTS and i have networking enabled but it its not letting me select wired or wireless networks
[18:46] <tata> My kids cant play online games on older pentium and Ubuntu 10.4, why? what is wrong?
[18:46] <ikonia> Tyler: there should be a splash option
[18:47] <ax562> @trism can you elaborate?
[18:47] <chapman> Hello there, fine win32-hating gentlemen.
[18:47] <chapman> Today, we shall talk about the wonderful teachings of Linus Torvalds.
[18:47] <ikonia> tata: your description of th eproblem is wrong
[18:47] <ikonia> tata: how about giving a proper explination of the problem
[18:47] <chapman> ikonia, sit down, sir. your arse must be hurting.
[18:47] <ax562> I'm runniing an arm based version but it is outdated and trying to upgrade
[18:47] <GunArm> i'm trying to mount an nfs share at home on a virtual machine at work, and it's timing out.  can anyone help me troubleshoot it? i nfs to that machine from other machines at home, can ssh from work, have the external IP of my work connection added to /etc/exports with the same format as the one that works locally at home, restarted nfs-kernel-server ran exportfs -r
[18:47] <chapman> so yes ikonia, how can I lose my virginity thru the terminal?
[18:48] <ikonia> chapman: stop that now please
[18:48] <ikonia> chapman: there is no need for it
[18:48] <chapman> ikonia, I guess you'll have to bring your mother to my house then.
[18:48] <Igramul> Where in the startup happens the setting of permissions in /dev. My system uses devtmpfs.
[18:48] <chapman> I shall purify her with my mutant cock.
[18:48] <mic__> might have found problem brb
[18:48] <ikonia> chapman: please stop
[18:48] <chapman> Why should I stop, ikonia?
[18:48] <chapman> Are you cursed?
[18:48] <chapman> but anyways
[18:48] <chapman> how can i mount a dir
[18:48] <wheatthin> chapman, you're looking to get banned, knock it off
[18:49] <chapman> wheattin, are you an faithful operator?
[18:49] <wheatthin> no, but pici is
[18:49] <ikonia> chapman: I am - please stop,
[18:49] <wheatthin> now stop
[18:49] <chapman> I shall stop, sorry <3
[18:49] <neekz0r> nice to know irc still has trolls
[18:49] <chapman> I shall be polite.
[18:49] <chapman> I apologize.
[18:49] <chapman> I came here to help people.
[18:49] <JustM0Bin> sooo can someone help me pleaseee
[18:50] <tata> ok, its today installed Ubuntu 10.4 and I think something missed, I add only a flash player 11.2 adobe, but nothing else, when I click on game, on line nothing happend?
[18:50] <deadweasel> ha
[18:50] <deadweasel> JustM0Bin: what's the problem?
[18:50] <GunArm> tata why did you install such an old version of ubuntu?
[18:50] <GunArm> thats no longer supported
[18:50] <mic__> k found problem and corrected. however machine still does not shows primary drive in devices
[18:50] <tata> because it is old pentium 3
[18:51] <wheatthin> mic__, was it the labling?
[18:51] <Igramul> ikonia: ok - this is off-topic, but where is the advantage of forcing someone to leave vs. /kick ?
[18:51] <k1l> tata: go with 12.04 and a lightweight flavour light lubuntu
[18:51] <ikonia> Igramul: horses for courses
[18:51] <wheatthin> Igramul, it gives them the chance to change their attitude
[18:51] <wilee-nilee> tata, 10.04 is end of life and not supported have you tried like 12.04 lubuntu?
[18:51] <TheSov> i have a small problem, when i mount an iscsi disk on my machine, it just starts transmitting 12 megabits of data consistently to the iscsi source. when i umount it, it stops any ideas whats happening?
[18:51] <mic__> no being the idiot i am at times, i did not partition drive b. once partitioned it showed up in the devices tab
[18:51] <mic__> but drive 1 does not yet show up
[18:51] <JustM0Bin> deadweasel i reinstalled 12.04 LTS and i have networking enabled but it wone let me click on wired or wireless network options
[18:52] <tata> lubuntu 12.4 no
[18:52] <Igramul> wheatthin: Isn't that the same as /kick without /ban. Well, never mind...
[18:52] <tata> I didnt try
[18:52] <wheatthin> mic__, did you parititon that one too?
[18:52] <Tyler> ikonia: all I'm getting is a screen with the option to boot ubuntu with linux, boot ubuntu with linux recovery mode, previous linux versions, and 2 memory test options
[18:52] <ikonia> Tyler: ok, so if you press "E" at that time, you get to edit those lines
[18:52] <ikonia> Tyler: you can then remove the "splash" option,
[18:52] <k1l> tata: 10.04 lost support for the desktop. so there is not much hope in fix issues and get (security) updates
[18:52] <mic__> its running 12.04 right now lol
[18:53] <wilee-nilee> tata, You might try, although not sure if you may need to netload it with a mini iso due to the age of the computer and kernels (pae).
[18:53] <tata> but, Ubuntu 10 .4 from last year and modern pentium work very good
[18:53] <ikonia> tata: keep in mind - flash is dead on linux from adobe's point of view
[18:53] <wilee-nilee> tata, Sure, but only the srver is supported as of now here.
[18:53] <Igramul> The documentation of devtmpfs says, everything in /dev gets owned by root. Can someone tell me where the final permissions are configured?
[18:54] <mic__> labelling is a bit confusing
[18:54] <deadweasel> JustM0Bin: try the command line vwersoin
[18:54] <wheatthin> Igramul, did you add yourself to plugdev?
[18:54] <deadweasel> JustM0Bin: nmcli con up wlan0
[18:54] <wilee-nilee> mic__, It can be strange at first to run linux, I was lucky I started there.
[18:54] <Igramul> wheatthin: no, the device files I want to access are not owned by plugdev.
[18:54] <mic__> ive gone to disk untility and default for primary is swap. obliviously this is not the drive i want to label
[18:54] <tata> so, You told to install Lubuntu 12.4 on old pent 3, is it corect?
[18:55] <gilligan> Hello, is there an elementary OS irc channel?
[18:55] <wheatthin> Igramul, they are operated by them..
[18:55] <wheatthin> it's what the groups is there fore
[18:55] <wilee-nilee> gilligan, #elementary
[18:55] <Tyler> ikonia: the screen that I'm looking at now has boot options then out to the right of one line it as "quiet splash $vt_handoff" do I delete that whole section, the whole line, or just the word splash?
[18:55] <BluesKaj> elementary OS , gilligan ?
[18:55] <ikonia> Tyler: splash
[18:55] <wheatthin> -e
[18:56] <Igramul> gilligan: OS theory, like in A. Tannenbaum's "Operating System"? I am afraid, there isn't.
[18:56] <mic__> k just figured it out
[18:56] <theseb> how customize unity's emacs launcher to add switch to adjust window size?
[18:56] <mic__> got labels in place now, however, primary extended drive still not showing up in devices, any suggestions
[18:56] <JustM0Bin_> sorry deadweasel my internet is fucked but i tried that and it said command not found
[18:57] <wheatthin> !language

[18:57] <Igramul> wheatthin: what do you mean by "operated by them"?
[18:57] <wheatthin> !plugdev
[18:58] <wilee-nilee> Erik____, Only if you tell the channel your problem.
[18:58] <Tyler> iknoia: I deleted splash then pressed f10 to boot. The screen did some weird graphical things and now I have a black screen and a command line. Is this what is supposed to be happening? if so, what do I do now?
=== heathjs is now known as heath
[18:58] <deadweasel> JustM0Bin: sudo apt-get install nmcli
[18:58] <deadweasel> then try.
[18:58] <ikonia> Tyler: that sounds like you booted recovery mode, rather than standard
[18:58] <deadweasel> i forgot that's not part of the distro
[18:58] <Erik____> I have 2 network cards, one is incomming internet, otherone is set 'shared to other computers'. Now I'd like to connect with Jack Adio to a Master computer on the network
[18:59] <deadweasel> JustM0Bin: I've found the network manager applet pretty unstable, so I just use command line when needed.
[18:59] <JustM0Bin_> deadweasel: it said unable to locate package nmcli
[18:59] <Erik____> Now somehow I can not get that working
[18:59] <JustM0Bin_> im trying to connect wirelessly
[18:59] <JustM0Bin_> just so you know
[18:59] <wheatthin> Igramul, just add yourself to plugdev and find out.
=== MobGod_ is now known as MobGod
[19:00] <Tyler> ikonia: how do I boot in standard? I pressed "e" to edit the boot options with the standard option highlighted then when it gave me the code, I erased splash the pressed f10?
[19:00] <deadweasel> JustM0Bin_: yup, if we can get nmcli installed it should be no problem.  let me find that package.
[19:00] <ikonia> Tyler: remove splash, then press "enter" then press "b"
[19:01] <mic__> any suggestions for getting my primary drive to show up in the devices tab
[19:01] <wheatthin> mic__, it shoudld come up as "Computer"
[19:02] <mic__> so if i understand 12.04 then primaries dont show up in devices tab just in the home folder as computer, is this correct
[19:02] <Erik____> wilee-nilee, do you have any idea?
[19:03] <deadweasel> Anyone know if NMCLI is included in the Network Manager package in ubuntu?
[19:03] <deadweasel> i thought it was from 10.10 up?
[19:03] <wheatthin> mic__, or it'll say "Filesystem"
[19:03] <wilee-nilee> Erik____, Not really I have not messed with networking. If you can describe what you have done you may get help if it is a recognizable problem you are stuck at.
[19:03] <llutz>  /msg ubottu find bin/nmcli
[19:03] <mic__> understood, but absolutely will not show up in devices via standard setup
[19:04] <wheatthin> and it's just labled home, cause that's the default option
[19:04] <wheatthin> is to show your home folder
[19:04] <mic__> so if i wish to copy a file to root directory of the primary, i must choose the default options of computer
[19:04] <llutz> deadweasel: " /msg ubottu find bin/nmcli" says yes
[19:04] <deadweasel> JustM0Bin_: I forget how to get that package, I think mine came with network manager....  I can't be sure.

[19:04] <deadweasel> Oh

=== lllnicg is now known as cong
[19:05] <Tyler> ikonia: okay, after doing that, I'm still on the edit boot optons screen. the enter key dropped "$vt_handoff" down one line then pressing "b" put a "b" before the "$vt_handoff". is this where I'm supposed to be?
[19:05] <mic__> thanks folks youve all been a big help and ive learned again something new for the day. like to try and learn something new daily
[19:05] <Erik____> wilee-nilee, I used to have standard networking settings and everything worked fine. But now I use a 1 networking card to get internet directly to my pc and a 2nd one for my local network.
[19:06] <mic__> gotta run thanks again
[19:06] <lmat> I'm wanting to transfer a few users from computer a to computer b.
[19:06] <wilee-nilee> Erik____, I can only help as far as I have without googling it.
[19:06] <ikonia> Tyler: I ddn't say "put b" in the line
[19:06] <lmat> I see that I need to copy over the appropriate entries from passwd and group and shadow, is there anything else I should worry about?
[19:06] <lmat> (none of them have home directories)
[19:06] <Erik____> wilee-nilee, I have read about settings a 'multicast address' for Netjack, but  I don't know how to do that
[19:07] <wilee-nilee> Erik____, You want to address the channel I can't really help any more than I have, if you post to me it can look for quick glances you are being helped.
=== Troy__ is now known as Troy^
[19:08] <wilee-nilee> I would if I could. ;)
[19:08] <Erik____> wilee-nilee, is there somewhere a good networking channel for these sorts of questions?

=== duckydan_ is now known as duckydan
[19:09] <Erik____> wilee-nilee, thanks a lot for helping
[19:09] <Tyler> Ikonia: that's just what it did i removed splash, pressed enter, then pressed b. it never changed me off of the boot options line. I'm using 12.04 if that helps at all, sorry I didn't include that earlier
[19:09] <ikonia> Tyler: I don't undersand what you're actually saying,
[19:09] <GunArm> can someone help me troubleshoot why I can't mount an NFS share?
[19:09] <salt_> account security while using irc, which is better?  1. login on with a standard account, pass word protected and primitions set to 7,0,0. 2. login on with a guest account were everything will be deleted on exit.   or are there more options?
[19:09] <ikonia> Tyler: when you press "b" it should boot the line you are on
[19:09] <wilee-nilee> Erik____, No prob, I have two things I focus on, can I actually help, and will my help brick you.
[19:10] <ikonia> salt_: what ?
[19:10] <Tyler> ikonia: nope, from what I can tell it just placed a "b" in the line
[19:11] <ikonia> Tyler: then you've not hit "enter" to exit out of edit mode
[19:11] <Erik____> wilee-nilee, :)
[19:14] <Tyler> ikonia: when I press enter, it just acts like enter would act on a word program, it drops everything, right of the cursor, down one line. at the bottom of the screen there are some options like press f10 to boot or ctrl-c to boot or press esc to discard changes and return to boot menu.
[19:14] <ikonia> Tyler: try escape
[19:16] <otak> Tyler: ctrl-x to boot with the edited commands
[19:17] <ikonia> thank you otak
[19:18] <Tyler> ikonia: when I press escape then b nothing happens. When I press escape then enter it just goes back to the command line on a black screen
[19:19] <ikonia> Tyler: check what otak said
[19:19] <nasir> how can i increase volume in gmusicbrowser?
[19:19] <Tyler> otak: when I press ctrl-x it does some weird graphical stuff then I get a black screen with a command line on it?
[19:20] <ikonia> Tyler: then you are not booting the standard mode, you are booting recovery mode
[19:20] <recon_lap> hi, anyone know of a way to boot to a cli using the mini live cd?

[19:22] <ikonia> Tyler: see if there are any warnings / errors

[19:23] <jrr> my ubuntu seems to have an identity crisis - it thinks it's a linaro distribution
[19:23] <jrr> how might I have done that?
[19:23] <ikonia> jrr: just explain the problem properly
[19:23] <shafox> ikonia: it says in mine root:root
[19:23] <shafox> shouldnt it say user:user?
[19:23] <jrr> cat /etc/lsb-release

[19:23] <ikonia> shafox: ooh, yes, root:root owns it
[19:23] <ikonia> shafox: no
[19:23] <jrr> also the bootloader menu says Linaro now
[19:24] <ikonia> jrr: either a.) you've installed the wrong distro b.) you've pointed it at different repos and updated the packages
[19:24] <wilee-nilee> jrr, You add any repos?
[19:24] <Daughain> Does q2.04 use x11 instead of dwindles?
[19:24] <k1l> jrr: what version of ubuntu are you running? what did you do before that appears?
[19:24] <Sach> ikonia: thanks!
[19:24] <Daughain> Xwindows
[19:24] <ikonia> Daughain: does what ?
[19:24] <shafox> ikonia, ok
[19:24] <jrr> I don't have any third-party sources atm
[19:24] <jrr> I believe this was originally installed at 12.04
[19:25] <petey> no luck with ##c++ , no one in there - am idoing something wrong>
[19:25] <ikonia> jrr: I suspect you are wrong
[19:25] <wilee-nilee> jrr, Pastebin cat /etc/apt/sources.list
[19:25] <iceroot> what is the packagename of the tool for setting up the displays? (dual view, mirror mode, resolution and so on) used in unity
[19:25] <ikonia> petey: there are many people in there - try asking in #freenode for how to search for channels
[19:25] <Daughain> ikonia: sorry, does 12.04 use xwindows still?
[19:25] <ikonia> Daughain: yes
[19:25] <recon_lap> petey: is it a simple loop, if so just paste bit it and i'll see if i can spot the issue
[19:25] <Daughain> How do I reboot xwindows from cli?
[19:25] <jrr> wilee-nilee: http://pastie.org/8128972
[19:26] <ikonia> recon_lap: please take it to private message if you want to help him write C
[19:26] <ikonia> Daughain: "sudo reboot"
[19:26] <jrr> based on commented cd-rom sources, I revise my hypothesis: I believe this was originally installed as 12.10 =]
[19:26] <Tyler> ikonia: when I press the power button to turn it on, a purple screen appears with the word ubuntu. there are 5 white dots underneath the word ubuntu which turn orange from left to right, then they change back to white in the same fashion. After they all are white again, they all flash orange and that's where the system freezes. As far as I can tell there are no warnings or errors
[19:26] <ikonia> Tyler: yes, so edit it, remove splash and boot, see if there are any errors/warnings ?
[19:27] <Daughain> ikonia: I don't want to reboot the whole system, just a reboot of xwindows to see if that's where my problem is.
[19:27] <k1l> jrr, Pastebin "ls -al /etc/apt/sources.list.d/"
[19:27] <ikonia> !nozap | Daughain
[19:27] <jrr> k1l: ah!

[19:27] <genii> Daughain: Assuming you're using the standard login system... sudo service lightdm restart
[19:28] <jrr> I do in fact have a linaro thing in there
[19:28] <Daughain> genii: thanks.
[19:28] <k1l> jrr: yes, that is where the 3rd. party repos go nowadays
[19:28] <jrr> new question: can dpkg -l tell me which source a given installed package came from?
[19:29] <K1rk> I'm trying to install bcmwl-kernel-source on a laptop and I'm getting an error when it tries to compile the DKMS module.

[19:29] <ikonia> Tyler: if you look at the grub menu before you edit it, is there a "safe" option

[19:32] <k1l> K1rk: make sure the headers file matches your kernel (uname -a)
[19:33] <Daughain_> Interesting.......I seem to have an issue woith xwindows strarting on boot. If I boot to cli and start xwindows, the system starts fine.
[19:34] <jjavaholic> how can I debug no unity calendar indicator.

[19:34] <genii> K1rk: Did you do an ldconfig  afterinstalling the headers?
[19:34] <genii> Meh, work. afk
[19:34] <seydar> I've got an issue with my iptables/ufw: root@majoit:~# ufw status
[19:34] <seydar> ERROR: problem running ip6tables
[19:35] <ikonia> seydar: 1.) why are you root
[19:35] <ikonia> seydar: 2.) do you have ipv6 setup
[19:35] <K1rk> genii, I installed the headers a long time ago.  I'm going to re-install and try to get the latest version on here.
[19:36] <seydar> ikonia: i am root because i am futzing with iptables in this one terminal window, and i *think* i have ipv6 setup. i was using ufw with no problems about two weeks ago
[19:36] <seydar> ikonia: how can i check to see if i have ipv6 set up?
[19:36] <lmat> So cd /etc; group gshadow passwd shadow      Are the only files I need to copy over to create the new users on the new system?
[19:36] <ikonia> seydar: you're really asking how to know if you're connected on ipv6...while you're trying to setup an ipv6 firewall ?
=== 16WAAPEO6 is now known as atrius`
[19:36] <ikonia> seydar: why are you trying to setup an ipv6 firewall if you don't even know if you're connected on ipv6
[19:37] <seydar> ikonia: whoa, i'm not intending to do anything for ipv6 specifically, though you're right, ufw does add rules for both normal ip and ipv6
[19:37] <ikonia> seydar: it should only add what you tell it to add
[19:38] <ikonia> seydar: I suspct it's trying to start ip6tables because there is a rule there
[19:40] <seydar> ikonia: i pushed some buttons, namely I ran `ufw disable` and then `ufw enable` and i got some intredasting results. namely, ufw status works now, but i'd like to troubleshoot the output it gave me from `ufw enable`
[19:41] <ikonia> check the iptables rules for v4 and v6
[19:42] <K1rk> I can't seem to find the correct version of the linux-headers in apt for the kernel I'm running....
[19:42] <seydar> `ip6tables --list` shows me no rules and everything is set to accept. this is a bad thing which i will address once i get my ufw business working
[19:42] <Delty> Halp plox
[19:42] <flan> is there a gui way to update to the latest version of gpodder?
[19:42] <ikonia> ufw business ?
[19:42] <genii> K1rk: Hopefully you didn't compile your own kernel.
[19:43] <K1rk> genii, nope... should not be anything non-standard here... although it is a Lucid machine still.
[19:43] <seydar> ikonia: http://pastebin.com/a1tNaJPE
[19:43] <n00b_> Hello is it possible to give the standard user-group (not-admin) access to the software-center without giving full sudo access?  and how would I go about it can it be done in the gui? edit /etc/sudoers?
[19:43] <K1rk> n00b_, yeah I think that can be done, you can give users sudo rights for certain commands only.
[19:43] <Delty> Everytime I try and boot ubuntu it says "Poor configuration" Or something along those lines
[19:43] <ikonia> lots of problems there
[19:44] <seydar> ikonia: many problems. i am a bad man.
[19:44] <ikonia> seydar: 1.) it can't load certain iptables kernels modules
[19:44] <n00b_> @kirk, so edit it to include access to dkpg and apt.get or?
[19:44] <K1rk> n00b_, check this out:  http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/allow-a-normal-user-to-run-commands-as-root.html
[19:44] <Jordan_U> n00b_: Though I don't know the details of how you would do that, I am pretty sure that it can be done, and that you would want to be looking at policykit rather than /etc/sudoers.
[19:44] <ikonia> seydar: 2.) it can't restore the exiting rules (probably because they reference rules for modules that are not loaded)
[19:44] <K1rk> jordan__, n00b_ we did it here but we used sudoers - we only allowed them to run certain commands as sudo
[19:44] <K1rk> n00b_, I think that link I sent you describes how to edit the sudoers file to achieve this.
[19:44] <ikonia> seydar: 3.) you're kernel appears to be a non-standard one, 2.6.32-042stab076.8 is not an ubuntu kernel, where did that come from
[19:45] <n00b_> @jordan, thx, i'' try and google policykit
[19:45] <K1rk> n00b_, you'd want your user to only be able to run apt, dpkg, software-center, etc...as sudo
[19:45] <ikonia> seydar: 4.) you've not got permissions to set the ipv4 network stack options, (probably due to lack of modules again)
[19:45] <Jordan_U> K1rk: n00b_: Software Center itself doesn't need to run as root, it only needs to use policykit to send commands to apt-daemon, so changing /etc/sudoers is the wrong approach.

[19:46] <ryan-c> so, I just updated firefox, and now when I right click my right click menu has like 100 items in it, most of which shouldn't be there
[19:46] <seydar> ikonia: the kernel is simply the one i got from my VPS
[19:46] <ikonia> seydar: I'd talk to your vps provider
[19:46] <ikonia> seydar: looks like a custom ubuntu spin
[19:46] <DigeratiW> any virtualbox / vmware gurus in here? I exported a virtualbox vm and it will not import in the vmwareplayer, got the error about failed to import OVF etc
[19:46] <ikonia> DigeratiW: try #vmware
[19:47] <seydar> ikonia: is it... a bad kernel? is it something that needs to be fixed and reinstalled, or can i install the missing modules now?
[19:47] <ikonia> seydar: you need to talk to your hosting provider, they have made your ubuntu build non-standard so it's impossible to tell what's going on without knowing what they have changed and why
[19:48] <wilee-nilee> ryan-c, Maybe a screenshot in a imagiebin.

[19:49] <n00b_> Jordan_U: thx, I'll look into that
[19:49] <wilee-nilee> Torikun, Thewre is a centos channel.
[19:49] <ikonia> Torikun: no, you'r ein #ubuntu - not #centos
[19:49] <rantic> Torikun: Sounds like you picked up the 32bit version
[19:50] <K1rk> Jordan_U, wrong approach perhaps, but it's how we did it on the Lucid build we pushed out 2 years ago and it did work for us.
[19:50] <Torikun> 64-bit for both
[19:50] <Torikun> x86_64 os install
[19:50] <ikonia> Torikun: take it to #centos please.
[19:50] <Torikun> this happened on ubuntu also
[19:50] <ikonia> Torikun: take it to #centos please.
[19:50] <Torikun> i just booted a live cd
[19:50] <rantic> deadweasel: It is?
[19:50] <Torikun> of ubuntu
[19:50] <ikonia> Torikun: take it to #centos please.
[19:51] <deadweasel> rantic, i'll stop helping now, because I'm not sure, my bad.  but if you're having sound issues, alsamixer is a good place to start.
[19:51] <deadweasel> what is the issue?
[19:51] <ultimamax> I recently installed Ubuntu from a disk. My computer has secureboot, but I just moved the boot priority of my ODD over the HDD, and it installed it. Now I can get into Ubuntu from grub just fine, but when I try to boot Windows 8, I get this error. http://i.imgur.com/7bh2Tjw.png Pressing a key brings me back to grub.
[19:51]  * deadweasel doesn't actually stop helping.
[19:52] <rantic> deadweasel: Oh don't worry about it now, I'm building an Ubuntu Minimal 13.04 system and wanted to know the name of the sound preferences program to use.
[19:52] <seydar> ikonia: i found some success in reducing the errors by changing /etc/default/ufw a bit and following http://blog.kylemanna.com/linux/2013/04/26/ufw-vps/
[19:53] <seydar> ikonia: i'm going to keep googling for the errors. thank you very much for your help and guidance
[19:53] <ryan-c> updating firebug fixed my firefox menu
[19:53] <rantic> deadweasel: when I right click the volume icon in the system tray and go to Sound Settings, the program that launches, I'd love to know the name

[20:03] <musicman_> Hi all - wondering if anyone is in the mood to enlighten me on wireless issues: I've been an Ubuntu user for about 5 years, have found workarounds for practically every issue I have ever run into. I am an Ubuntu evangelist, and this recent issue has shamed me and Ubuntu to the point where I'm not telling anyone to switch anymore, as people I have helped switch have also randomly lost all wireless connectivity on one of the recent upda
[20:03] <musicman_> tes. The issue seems to center around all things broadcom...I've truly scoured the forums, and come up empty handed. The issue doen't seem to be system specific, as my buddies' laptops wireless crapped out at the same time...

[20:07] <musicman_> no error messages - just no wireless device even functioning of being recognized.
[20:07] <musicman_> was there some kernel level change of wireless/broadcom drivers??
[20:08] <musicman_> it is so frustrating and embarrassing
[20:09] <musicman_> tried all the standard workarounds, such as using the alternative drivers, tried importing stuff from windows (where the device and wireless are still working flawlessly)

[20:43] <musicman_> First time on IRC!
[20:43] <recon_lap> musicman_: the give us the link created so we can see the page
[20:43] <musicman_> That was funny (
[20:44] <robin_> I tried "gstreamer-properties" went to video, and under "default input", i tested it and got the test pattern... then ran "video for linux 2" and got the following message: "video for linux 2 (v4l2): device '/dev/video0" cannot capture at 16384x16384"
[20:44] <robin_> oh, sorry, the deivice is my VENUS camera... so the computer knows it's there! that was the output for the test button.
[20:44] <recon_lap> robin_: v4l2 is for getting your camera to work in java, you need it working in the OS first
[20:45] <robin_> duly noted :) I'm just hunting in message forums for people who've faced similar challenges
[20:45] <jilebedev> Hi. Is there a man page describing the various /dev entries that are not actual physical devices? For example, to distinguish between /dev/random and /dev/urandom?
[20:46] <musicman_> did you get the pastebin output?
[20:46] <musicman_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5862850/
[20:46] <musicman_> there you go!
[20:46] <musicman_> lol
[20:47] <jhutchins> robin_: That's pretty high res.
[20:47] <musicman_> I have the broadcom wireless driver manually deactivated though, as it wasn't working anyway
[20:47] <recon_lap> musicman_: look like you got no driver loaded, pastebin the output of lshw -C network
[20:47] <robin_> jhutchins: no kidding!
[20:47] <Znoosey> jilebedev, try man urandom
[20:48] <recon_lap> robin_: do you have a link to a description of your issue, I might have some tips
[20:49] <robin_> the description is this: I have a fresh install of 13.04, and a VENUS USB2.0 webcam. It's plugged in and the computer knows it's there, but cheese and guvcview don't recognize it.
[20:49] <musicman_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5862865/
[20:49] <robin_> I'd love whatever help you can render, Recon_lap, I need it for a PhD course I'm taking -panic-
[20:50] <musicman_> I can reactivate the broadcom drivers and give you the output with it on.... want me to do that?
[20:50] <Seegee> Guys, I have a question. Basically, what I want to do is send a GET request to a web server, and then view which IP the web server sends the reply from, is that possible?
[20:50] <ozzloy> i have a vm here that doesn't have internet and i'm not sure why
[20:50] <robin_> I just ran "guvcview -d /dev/videoX" and it spat out, "Guvcview error: unable to open device, please make sure the camera is connected and the correct driver is installed." I would imagine that is my issue: Drivers
[20:50] <ozzloy> how do i start investigating "no internet"?  it used tohave internet
[20:51] <recon_lap> musicman_: you truned off you bcom , aggh , that might explain why it did not show
[20:51] <musicman_> lol!
[20:51] <_44trent3> I seem to be having issues updating my video driver. The GPU is ATI (yes ATI) Radeon HD 2600. I cannot seem to update it through the download on the AMD  Site. Its *supossed* to work. I made sure it was the linux one.
[20:52] <jhutchins> robin_: That sounds like permissions on /dev/video0 may not allow everybody to access it.  It should have group permissions, users need to be a  member of the right group.
[20:52] <musicman_> I'll turn it back on/reactivate, and can give you the output again if you'd like
[20:52] <robin_> I'm the only user... I can do "sudo chmod 777 /dev/video0"  yes?
[20:53] <robin_> i'm not totally green, just confused at webcam jargon :P
[20:53] <recon_lap> musicman_: that would be good. what to see if i can work out what driver it's trying to load
[20:53] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, you're talking about the proprietary amd driver, fglrx, _44trent3? I wouldn't recommend d/ling the driver from that site...

[20:54] <meetri> can someone recommend a good remote desktop client/server app to use in ubuntu? Remmina is soo buggy...
[20:54] <robin_> computer picks it up in LSUSB but no programs pick it up
[20:55] <_44trent3> The link is http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx It does have Radeon HD 2xxx series in the seletion for the GPU series.
[20:55] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, are you aware that driver has horrible 2d acceleration? You'd only really use that driver if you're a gamer.... _44trent3 I suggest you install it from Ubuntu's repos.

[20:56] <robin_> cheese shows black screen, and guvcview fails outright
[20:57] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, the drivers from that site aren't approved by ubuntu, you see? and I've seen people install those drivers and have problems, like getting blank screen on boot up cuz X won't start. download and install at your own risk. But I recommend you download and install it with sudo apt-get install fglrx
[20:57] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, what ubuntu version are you on?
[20:57] <_44trent3> I'm on 12.04 LTS

[20:57] <_44trent3> I think...
[20:58] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, okay, lick on the dash board, and type in Software Sources
[20:58] <Ari-Yang> then go to the 'Additional Drivers' tab and see if you see fglrx there, if you do, select it and install it from there
[20:58] <musicman_> (recon_lap) Hey - here is the nm tool output with bcm activated: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5862883/
[20:58] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, or open up a terminal and type sudo apt-get install fglrx or sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates
[20:58] <whatsyourname> give me some facts why ubuntu is better than windows
[20:59] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, after installing, reboot
[20:59] <Ari-Yang> whatsyourname, I recommend you google that

[20:59] <Ari-Yang> whatsyourname, this is a support channel (for ubuntu)....
[20:59] <recon_lap> robin_: just saw you earlier description, do a lshw on you camera and check what driver it;s using
[21:00] <_44trent3> Okee dokee I'll restart
[21:00] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, you installed it?
[21:00] <Dalek-Caan> I have this issue where one of my harddisks is not readable in Ubuntu since I switched from Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows now sees it as a RAW disk and Ubuntu does detect the disk, but I can not mount it, anyone?
[21:00] <_44trent3> Its installing, I meant once its done.
[21:01] <robin_> the only output is PCI (sysfs), SCSI. I assume it's taking time to retrieve the information. Will pastebin when it's done :)
[21:01] <recon_lap> musicman_: ok, now lshw -C network

[21:06] <Dalek-Caan> Jordan_U; By "messed up" I mean, since I installed Ubuntu it no longer accessible, it was always working under Windows
[21:07] <adac> my middle mouse button does not work with pasting. How can I activate this?
[21:08] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: Is it currently working in Windows? Is sdb the the problematic disk? Was the problematic disk ever part of your FakeRAID array?
[21:08] <wilee-nilee> robin_, Not sure the webcam I have plugs and plays, I have not had to investigate problems in general.
[21:08] <recon_lap> musicman_: anyway , you card is using 'atl1c' driver by the looks of things. we could try blacklisting that driver. other that that I have few ideas

[21:09] <doomlord_> (previously it didn't work on12.04

[21:10] <Dalek-Caan> Jordan_U; But even if I go into my bios and change the raid controller to any other option, it does not work.
[21:11] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: Could you please answer my other questions?
[21:11] <wilee-nilee> robin_, I would try a thread on the ubuntu forums or askubuntu  http://askubuntu.com/
[21:11] <wilee-nilee> and/or
[21:13] <Dalek-Caan> Jordan_U; I know the label is "Data 2" how can I check which harddisk that is?
[21:14] <Dalek-Caan> Jordan_U; It is sdb2, sorry, tried to mount it and it gave an error saying: Error mounting /dev/sdb2 at /media/raymond/Data 21: Command-line `mount -t "ntfs" -o
[21:14] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: Unfortunately labels are part of the filesystem, so if the filesystem is not detected the label can't be read. You can try "sudo blkid".
[21:15] <Dalek-Caan> Jordan_U; Apparently something is found though, since it does call the HDD "Data 2", this is what the pop-up shows: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5862938/

[21:19] <_44trent3> It gave me an error
[21:19] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, you might have to check /etc/X11/xorg.conf (if you have one that is)
[21:19] <Dalek-Caan> Jordan_U; No it has not been part of the fake-raid but even if I disable that, it does not get recognized.
[21:19] <happyface> Is there a way I can scan all files and output the one with the smallest diff from a source file?
[21:19] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, what error? pastebin it
[21:20] <Otterley> hi folks, if you're running Ubuntu Lucid as a Xen PV guest, DO NOT UPGRADE to the latest kernel!
[21:20] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: The symptoms you're seeing are consistent with trying to mount a partition from one device of a RAID array (rather than assembling the array and mounting from there).
[21:20] <Otterley> you will be unable to reboot your host
[21:20] <Slart> happyface: if you can figure out a way to get a number for the difference between two files it ought to be possible

[21:21] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, you get that when you type fglrxinfo?
[21:21] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, tbh not sure what the prob is, I'm not too good with figuring out fglrx problems :V
[21:22] <Ari-Yang> you can just sit tight and see if anybody gets to you
[21:22] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, you should also check demsg

[21:25] <Ari-Yang> .___.
[21:26] <recon_lap> musicman_: did you pastebin the output of lsmod
[21:26] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: If this is, as it appears it might be, one drive of a multi drive RAID then you'll nees to find the other device and assemble the array, or if that other device is no longer available or has been repartitioned to be used as an independant disk, then you may not be able to recover your data.
[21:26] <_44trent3> I do have an external monitor. I'll see if disconnecting will fix this issue.
[21:26] <Otterley> look, I'm here to help people.  be pedantic to someone who's not identifying kernel bugs for you.
[21:26] <Otterley> and serious ones at that
[21:26] <whoever> Otterley: why would you need to know if someone is a maintainer
[21:27] <Ari-Yang> whoever, he asked because he didn't want to say what you said to wilee-nilee if he was a maintainer
[21:27] <wilee-nilee> power trip
[21:27] <Dalek-Caan> Jordan_U; This has always been a single disk, no raid setup. And yesterday it was working fine with the same setting under Windows Server 2008 R2, until I installed Ubuntu
[21:27] <recon_lap> musicman_ you can follow the guide I am at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide/Drivers#Check_Driver
[21:27] <Otterley> whoever, I'd want to know in case that person is actually in charge of triaging bugs so they get to the right person
[21:27] <Ari-Yang> now all of this is pretty much pointless now, we should move on....
[21:27] <Otterley> in which case, I'd do whatever they said
[21:28] <_44trent3> I cant even lower the screen res
[21:28] <holstein> Otterley: you could try the server dev mailing list.. 10.04 on the desktop is EOL, and actually the server is too, so it might be challenging to find someone to give it attention
[21:29] <Otterley> holstein, server shouldn't be EOL
[21:29] <boutell> Hi. How do I disable a RAID device - not one drive, the ENTIRE device - so I can ask mdadm to RE-assemble it? It's confused about the drive letters after the removal of a USB device.
[21:29] <_44trent3> How many people have had this issue?
[21:29] <holstein> Otterley: i didnt say it should or shouldnt be.. i said it *is* soon
[21:29] <boutell> this is linux software RAID, mdadm, thus right channel.
[21:29] <Otterley> server is maintained until April 2015, and there is plenty of velocity on kernel updates
[21:29] <musicman_> (recon_lap); sounds good mate! I'll go for it. Got to sign off for a bit, but deeply appreciate your assistance. You are great!!!!!
[21:30] <Ari-Yang> holstein,  wilee-nilee, just misunderstood I think.
[21:30] <whoever> Otterley: thx, but still a little confused, sine , the people here are volunteers , and if it is a bug(usally something someone has not seen before, ) you would be advised to go to the pkg site, and file a bug  report there
[21:30] <Ari-Yang> he probably thought Otterley was talking about the desktop
[21:30] <holstein> Otterley: i thought the point was a lack of velocity, and that might be why
[21:31] <holstein> Otterley: so, you tried the server dev list, then?
[21:31] <Ari-Yang> whoever, I think he did. he just wanted to give people here a heads up is all
[21:31] <Otterley> I only came here to point to the bug and let people know.
[21:31] <Otterley> you're welcome. :P
[21:31] <holstein> Otterley: thanks..
[21:31] <boutell> I can't get past "mdadm: device /dev/md0 already active - cannot assemble it"
[21:31] <boutell> aha: --stop
[21:31] <_44trent3> Should I make  a pastbin dmesg?
[21:31] <holstein> Otterley: and your time is appreciated.
[21:32] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: The ntfs filesystem on that partition is larger, according to the Master File Table, than the partition. I can't think of a way that installing Ubuntu to an unrelated disk could change the MFT in this way.
[21:32] <whoever> Ari-Yang: ah, if he did or din't i didn't see that , all i really say was him asking if wilee-nilee was a maintainer, and then telling him to pipe down, with nothing else to go on, i assumed he, might be new
[21:33] <boutell> ... everything is cool now. I wish Linux didn't have variable drive letters at all.
[21:33] <Dalek-Caan> Me neither Jordan_U  :(
[21:33] <_44trent3> Ari? Maybe restarting would fix it? Do you think it might?
[21:33] <nrze> hey guys, i wanna start using linux, would ubuntu be good to start?
[21:33] <Dalek-Caan> Dalek-Caan; There was some ntfs program under Ubuntu to fix certain errors, like these, but it was tricky someone said yesterday to me, do you know something to try and fix this error?
[21:33] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: My guess is that the MFT has remained the same, which leads to the question of why a dilesystem would be creates that's larger than its containing device (which would be explained by its actual underlying "device" being an array).
[21:34] <_44trent3> Would restarting maybe fix it?
[21:34] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: Beyond that, I'm stumped as to where to go from here :(
[21:34] <ricky_> when will ubuntu be rolling release? please need answer
[21:34] <whoever> is there a way, to quit the auto-search in dash? ie: i can start typingin and get amazon results back

[21:35] <Dalek-Caan> Jordan_U; There is no way I can tell Ubuntu the harddisk is exactly the same size as it's twin brother?
[21:36] <Dalek-Caan> Or is there a way to populate/calculate this out, Jordan_U ?
[21:36] <recon_lap> nrze: none easier, but ubuntu unity has moved towards a very consumer orientated approach, so it's quite different from most other distros
[21:37] <nrze> how do you mean recon?
[21:38] <gordonjcp> nrze: Ubuntu would be a great distro to start with.  Do you expect anyone in here to tell you any different? ;-)
[21:38] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: If this is really the proper containing device then the filesystem is badly broken and needs to be fixed. The only tool for fixing ntfs is Windows' chkdsk, but if this data is important you should make an image of the filesystem before attempting to fix it.
[21:38] <recon_lap> nrze: sort of depends on why you want to use linux.
[21:40] <Dalek-Caan> Windows won't run chkdsk on it and tells me the harddisk needs to be formatted before it can be used (it is seen as a RAW HDD now by Windows, since Ubuntu's installation) Jordan_U
=== Nitrodex is now known as Guest39520
[21:42] <recon_lap> gordonjcp: I would hope that they would try to point someone to the most suitable distro depending on their needs rather that just recommend the version they use.
[21:42] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: I don't know what to do then, sorry. photorec may be able to recover some files. Are there important files there that you don't have backups of?
[21:43] <Dalek-Caan> Yes, there are, Jordan_U , but I will try to run Acronis to make an image and see how much I can recover with it, thanks for trying to help though.
[21:43] <Jordan_U> Dalek-Caan: You're welcome. Good luck.

[21:55] <holstein> Freb: what de? unity? i would just search the package manager of your choice for what you are looking for. synaptic is nice
[21:56] <Freb> holstein: i mean the whole DE set
[21:56] <holstein> Freb: sure. for what DE?
[21:57] <holstein> Freb: as i said, for example, if you are talkginb about unity.. search unity in a file manager.. for XFCE, search that
[21:57] <Freb> what?
[21:58] <holstein> Freb: if you are talking about the xfce desktop environment, search for that.. search XFCE..
[21:58] <holstein> if not, search for what you are wanting.. or elaborate here for a volunteer

[21:59] <holstein> ^^ thats what i read Freb .. and it says not what DE you want
[22:00] <holstein> but, the search will be the same.. if you want the LXDE, search LXDE
[22:01] <varunendra> jjavaholic, recovering the file itself is possible in photorec, it can identify .gho files. But for recovering within them, you may have to rely on ghost explorer that comes with it.
[22:01] <neho> anyone can answer a few questions about intel 845 g/gl and set up in linux mint nadia 14 and do I need al or gl with the 3d graphics i can't find packages on those.

[22:04] <holstein> Freb: some are easier, and lighter to do this with than others
[22:04] <holstein> Freb: you would still have to say, for example "i am trying to install LXDE without any extra packages".. you are saying "i want just the DE".. and not naming the DE
[22:05] <neho> what version are they up to ubuntu I know of raring.. but i haven
[22:05] <Freb> yea i know, but i wish to have those just with the base, and not the applications.. so i could install those i want, cus i was thinking about have all of them.

[22:07] <Freb> holstein: you understand what i mean?
[22:09] <holstein> Freb: you want to run many desktop environments at once.. correct?
[22:09] <Freb> holstein: yes, having many to use, but not conflicting with each other, and  that i could use my defualt software for each? :)
[22:10] <Freb> that would be awsome
[22:10] <holstein> Freb: they *do* conflict with each other.. thats why i suggest taking it slow and adding LXDE first

[22:11] <Freb> holstein: ok, why?

[22:11] <Freb> holstein: why would i start with lxde, what is the idea of yours with it? :)
[22:11] <otak> Freb: you could try eg. apt-cache depends lxde and maybe use the --no-install-recommends flag with apt-get
[22:12] <holstein> Freb: i said that it is easy to start with.. it doesnt confilt with anything that i have tried, and its easy to setup and install

[22:15] <Freb> holstein: haha, yea. but do you know what  to do with that i ask about?
[22:16] <loller> i think ubuntu should remove the pink and purple theme from unity
[22:16] <loller> its gay and discourages new users

[22:17] <_44trent3> Is there something similar to rolling back drivers like in Windows?
[22:17] <holstein> Freb: --no-install-recommends flag as otak suggests
[22:17] <holstein> _44trent3: you can find the driver and roll it back.. synaptic has an easy-ish GUI for that
[22:17] <Freb> holstein: what? jesus
[22:17] <OerHeks> Freb, For minimal Lubuntu installation, choose lubuntu-core. For minimal LXDE installation, choose lxde-core.
[22:18] <holstein> Freb: you are not saying what you want, friend.. if you want specifics, just say what you want... otherwise, install *any* de trying the --no-install-recommends flag
[22:18] <Freb> ok, i mean as an package?
[22:18] <_44trent3> How do I do that Holstein?
[22:19] <holstein> _44trent3: i would literally install and open synaptic, go to the package with the driver i installed, and in the menu, force the older version i want

[22:25] <wilee-nilee> wissam, Not familiar with razor-qt, key here as suggetd you want to be able to remove stuff you install dektops can be problematic there without install lists. So do it from a terminal and save the installed packages to a text editor or use synaptic where a history is left. Tio fremove you would not just remove the install like lxde, but a package list.
[22:25] <holstein> _44trent3: you should just remove it then, and go from there

[22:36] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, you're probably in "low graphics" mode because fglrx failed to load
[22:36] <ikonia> do you me the stdio header ?
[22:36] <Ari-Yang> by "low graphics" mode do you mean VESA?
[22:37] <Ari-Yang> !vesa
[22:37] <ubottu> vesa is the default video driver if X can't find a better one. Also see !x
[22:37] <_44trent3> If it failed, how do I make it unfailed
[22:37] <Ari-Yang> dunno...
[22:37] <Ari-Yang> it sounds like your problem is fglrx failing....
[22:37] <Ari-Yang> _44trent3, perhaps google around to see?
[22:37] <ikonia> Ari-Yang: have you actually checked....
[22:37] <wooo> ikonia, no, .c file in which source code of function like fopen() will be there.
[22:37] <Ari-Yang> ikonia, checked what?
[22:37] <ikonia> see if it IS loading or not, see if that IS the problem
[22:38] <ikonia> before sending him off to google something that may not be the problem
[22:38] <wooo> ikonia, and also where stdio.h is present ?
[22:38] <Ari-Yang> it sounds like it has failed ikonia; he ran fglrxinfo in terminal and got some error
[22:38] <ikonia> wooo: ok, so that function will be referenced from a header thats included most likely

[23:24] <ikonia> Eredien: what do you want to do ?
[23:25] <Eredien> I want to ultimately reinstall ubuntu from the live usb I made but right now when I turn on my computer it boots to the grub rescue mode so right now I am trying to find out where the grub.cfg files are and other core os files but they appear to be missing ?
[23:26] <ikonia> Eredien: ok, so why are you looking for these files if you want to re-install, just re-install and they will get re-created
[23:26] <Eredien> The computer won't boot; not into anything but a grub rescue prompt. It won't boot from live usb
[23:27] <ikonia> Eredien: so that suggests your liveusb is not created correctly

[23:28] <ikonia> Eredien: either a.) you made it wrong b.) your system doesn't support booting from usb c.) your pen drive is broken
[23:28] <f0urtyfive> is there any way I can see if a specific commit was included in the latest ubuntu kernel, or if I need to roll my own?
[23:28] <f0urtyfive> specifically  58b2939b4d5a030eaec469d29812ab8477ee7e76
[23:28] <ikonia> Eredien: which is the more likely
[23:28] <styles> My installation is screwed up. I reinstalled AMD drivers (from their site) and then the top and side bar are completely missing. I've tried reinstalling ubuntu-desktop, no luck.
[23:28] <ikonia> f0urtyfive: it won't work like that as the ubuntu kenrnels are patched
[23:29] <Eredien> Okay, I get it, but what I am saying is that this computer used to have ubuntu on it then one day it just booted only to the grub rescue prompt and that's all it does. When I run ls it looks like the files are there but the os can't find 'em
[23:29] <ikonia> f0urtyfive: it's base version + patches
[23:29] <ikonia> Eredien: that has nothing to do with your usb - fix your usb boot
[23:29] <f0urtyfive> ikonia: is their an ubuntu git that has the source for the current kernel so I could check myself?
[23:30] <ikonia> f0urtyfive: no
[23:30] <ikonia> f0urtyfive: and as I've just said - it doesn't work like that
[23:30] <ikonia> f0urtyfive: pick the version ubuntu ships with, check it against the main line - don't worry about the patches
[23:30] <ikonia> (being realistic)
[23:30] <Eredien> this is without the usb in; when I put the usb in all that happens is a new hd and partition show up when I do ls on the hd at the rescue prompt
[23:31] <ikonia> Eredien: so ?
[23:31] <f0urtyfive> ikonia: ok, will have to wait for this box to finish updating then check the source package for the 1 line I want :P
=== Jucelio is now known as JucelioJair
[23:31] <Eredien> and it doesn't recognize the filesystem on any of the hd partitions except the hd that is already there (sans live usb)
[23:32] <ikonia> Eredien: again so ?? what has this got to do with booting your livecd
[23:33] <Eredien> What I am trying to say is that the liveusb isn't recognized when I plug it in and it has nothing to do with the liveusb working or not since it boots fine on the windows machine I made it on
[23:33] <Eredien> I get the same grub rescue prompt whether the live usb is in or not
[23:33] <ikonia> Eredien: right, so think it through,
[23:33] <ikonia> Eredien: that suggests it's not trying to boot from usb
[23:34] <ikonia> Eredien: so that goes back to the 3 points I gave you earlier
=== Guest72740 is now known as MobGod
[23:34] <ikonia> Eredien: 1.) you didn't make the usb properly 2.) your machine doesn't support booting from usb 3.) your usb disk is faulty
[23:35] <Eredien> I'm happy to get another usb stick and try again with pen drive but like you said, it's not trying to boot from usb in the first place, all it's doing is recognizing another hd partition. How is making another pen drive going to help since it won't recognize usb at all since all the grub etc. files are missing or corrupted?
[23:36] <ikonia> Eredien: READ what I said
[23:36] <ikonia> Eredien: which of those situations is more realistic
[23:36] <ikonia> Eredien: you know the pendrive is good as it boots on another machine, so you can have confidence in 1.) and 3.) being "ok" so what does that leave
[23:37] <foobarian> IdleOne: I disagree.  It is my information and was posted publicly without my permission. This is a fundamental violation of the philosophy of Free Software.  If this is acceptable then why not send other information from users computers to any company willing to pay? to
[23:37] <ikonia> f0urtyfive: it's nothing to do with free software philosophy
[23:37] <Eredien> It's an eee, with no cd drive, how am I supposed to reinstall if it won't support booting from usb?
[23:37] <ikonia> f0urtyfive: no where in free software philosophy does it say "data shouldn't be posted publicly"
[23:37] <f0urtyfive> ikonia: >_>
[23:38] <ikonia> foobarian: is there anything confidential in the post, yes/no
[23:38] <ikonia> f0urtyfive: oops, foobarian was the target
[23:38] <ikonia> sorry
[23:39] <foobarian> ikonia: All of the information is my private property.
[23:39] <wilee-nilee> foobarian, You can turn off the public post of the boot repair on the app.
[23:39] <ikonia> foobarian: is there anything confidential in the post, yes/no
=== CyberJacob is now known as CyberJacob|Away
[23:40] <foobarian> wilee-nilee: This is correct but boot-repair should notify the user BEFORE posting the information!
[23:40] <ikonia> foobarian: is there anything confidential in the post, yes/no
[23:41] <wilee-nilee> foobarian, Can I suggest you cut the prozacs in half. ;)
[23:41] <Eredien> ikonia: all it has is usb ports. No cd. So since the SSD won't boot right, is this really bricked?
[23:42] <ikonia> Eredien: no - please read what I'm saying
[23:42] <foobarian> wilee-nilee: ha ha ha.  I guess ad-hominim is the best you can do.
[23:42] <IdleOne> foobarian: I understand your point and if you are that concerned you may want to contact the maintainers of bootrepair. I am just giving you the info I know from experience, won't hurt you to email the paste bin admins. I just don't think they will bother to remove it unless the is sensitive/confidential info.
[23:43] <Eredien> Okay, you are suggestion #2 as the option that it won't boot from USB and I agree with you, but I don't know what to do as all I have are USB ports to try and reinstall the os
=== BadLarry is now known as BadLarry_
[23:43] <IdleOne> foobarian: any further discussion about this is off topic for this channel.
[23:43] <ikonia> Eredien: ok - so you've accepted 2.) as the likely reason. Should your system support boot from USB by design ?
[23:44] <Eredien> Yes. I have booted from usb before. In the BIOS removable media is listed as the first boot check option
[23:44] <ikonia> Eredien: ok, so it "should" boot from usb media, and we know the media is good as you've tested it on other machines
[23:45] <Eredien> Sure
[23:45] <ikonia> Eredien: that leaves us to 1.) a hardware problem on your machine 2.) a configuration problem on your machine/bios
[23:45] <ikonia> Eredien: so now you've narrowed it down to the real issue
[23:48] <Eredien> I *think* it is a configuration problem due to the fact that I am having trouble finding where the grub files are once it boots into rescue mode, it looks like some of the other files (initrd.img for instance) are still there on the partition
[23:48] <ikonia> Eredien: NO !
[23:48] <Eredien> No, ok
[23:48] <ikonia> Eredien: grub is nothing to do with your hardware/bios
[23:49] <ikonia> Eredien: forget grub - your machine is broke, you want to re-install, your proven install media isn't working
[23:49] <ikonia> that tells us there is a configure/fault with your hardware
[23:49] <ikonia> fix it before moving forward
[23:49] <Eredien> Thank you.
[23:50] <Litepool> anyone good with mysql? i made a symbolic link and apparmour don't liike it
[23:50] <ikonia> Litepool: update the apparmour rule
=== Troy_ is now known as Troy^
[23:51] <Litepool> ikonia what sort of update do i do, never touched apparmour before
[23:51] <ikonia> Litepool: why do you think the issue is apparmour rule ?
[23:52] <Litepool> ikonia, folks at #mysql sent me here telling me they positive it is apparmour rule
[23:52] <ikonia> Litepool: "why"
[23:52] <Litepool> i followed this guide ikonia http://www.webhostrepo.com/blog/how_to_change_mysql_data_directory/
[23:52] <ikonia> ok, just read the scroll back in #mysql
[23:53] <ikonia> Litepool: why are you changing the data directories ?
[23:53] <Litepool> i setup an ssd
[23:53] <Litepool> for my db
[23:53] <Litepool> i really need my database back up and running, as its crucial
[23:53] <Litepool> instead of reinstalling i just did this
[23:53] <ikonia> you don't need to re-install
[23:53] <Litepool> for the quickest way of migrating
[23:53] <ikonia> why are you moving this data ???
[23:54] <ikonia> that guide is terrible
[23:54] <Litepool> my old hd can't handle the writes
[23:54] <Litepool> i know i read the comment
[23:54] <ikonia> really ??? how many read/write operations are you getting ?
[23:54] <Litepool> well il explain sometime if it isn't relevant
[23:54] <Litepool> really need this db up
[23:55] <ikonia> Litepool: I would suggest putting it back to normal first of all
[23:55] <ikonia> undo what you've done
[23:55] <ikonia> then move it properly
[23:55] <Litepool> i can undo it easily
[23:55] <ikonia> that way your database is up
[23:55] <Litepool> however, i don't want another downtime
[23:55] <ikonia> it's down already....
[23:55] <ikonia> so get it back up
[23:55] <ikonia> undo it
[23:55] <Litepool> so while its down i want to fix it
[23:55] <Litepool> i run a mining pool
[23:55] <Litepool> people can't keep connecting
[23:56] <Litepool> its bad for there hardware
[23:56] <ejv> you need some replication / failover sounds like, so downtown doesn't affect you
[23:56] <ikonia> then you should have an idea what you are doing and how to manage this
[23:56] <ejv> errr downtime*
[23:56] <ikonia> you can't approach this issue like thia
[23:56] <Litepool> well i didn't really expect it to happen, ufcourse i can put it back up
[23:56] <ikonia> and you shouldn't be following random guides off the web
[23:56] <Litepool> i didn't delete the /var/lib/mysql, i renamed it
[23:56] <Litepool> after syncing
[23:56] <Litepool> easy to bring it back up
[23:57] <Litepool> ikonia, what do you have in mind>?
[23:57] <epimeth> hi guys... My rub got fubar upgrading from LTS to whatever the next version was... 12.04 maybe?  I set prefix to (blabla)/boot/grub/i36-pc and insmod linux but get error: symbol not found: 'grub_realidt'
[23:57] <ikonia> Litepool: what do you mean ?
[23:57] <epimeth> s/rub/grub
[23:58] <Litepool> ikonia, i don't know i thought you had a suggestion
[23:58] <Litepool> ?
[23:58] <ikonia> Litepool: I'd get the box back up, then actually analyise the problem, and come up with a real solution, rather than then buying an SSD and following a random guide off the web
[23:59] <ikonia> if your writes are as high as you are suggesting where a normal disk can't actually keep up - then you'll blow that SSD away rather quickly
