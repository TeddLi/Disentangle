[10:27] <kinja-sheep> I have a question about aptitude.  When I ran a command to install, it went off to retrieve the package, uncompress, configure and install it.  Correction?  Is there anything I can do to delete the package afterward?
[10:30] <trijntje> lexie, what is your problem?
[10:30] <guntbert> kinja-sheep: sudo aptitude remove <package>
[10:31] <kinja-sheep> guntbert: Right. I'm trying to help somebody with 4GB for a hard drive. I'm not certain if minimal is the way to go considering it'd have to download more than 4GB of packages.

[10:32] <mimir|on> hi, is there a way to use just evolution calendar, standalone, not with all the evolution app ?
[10:32] <kinja-sheep> guntbert: I'm looking for something that'd download, uncompress, install, and delete the package before moving on to the next package.
[10:32] <mimir|on> i don't need the mail part
[10:32] <guntbert> kinja-sheep: ah, I misunderstood - your concern is the package file itself - then my command would not be helpful
[10:33] <kinja-sheep> guntbert: Yes. Obviously. :)
[10:33] <joaopinto> kinja-sheep, a minimal install is not 4GB
[10:33] <joaopinto> minimal as in, no windows manager
[10:33] <mimir|on> or is there a way to disable the mail part from evolution? and leave everything else ?
[10:33] <kinja-sheep> joaopinto: Yes, but we'd be able to install the packages manually.
[10:33] <Igramul> Do I have to use special kernel parameters (grub) to configure a FritzCard Classic (ISA PnP)?

[10:34] <kinja-sheep> joaopinto: 512MB which will be used (for minimal).
[10:35] <isolat3dsh33p> Question: How to install back default packages?
[10:35] <kinja-sheep> joaopinto: Or does the minimal does that automatically? (eg download, then install?) but I'm certain it does obtain all packages first.

[10:36] <[-hide-]> I took over an hour to download this wubi file, is there a way to get past this error?
[10:37] <kinja-sheep> joaopinto: It made me wonder about how people are able to install on their netbooks without minimal approach. I'm guessing that Dell use dd (to hard drives) and make things looks bad on Ubuntu.
[10:37] <om26er> !test
[10:37] <ubottu> yes, I'm alive.
[10:38] <joaopinto> kinja-sheep, oh wait, if you refer to install from cd, packages are not copied to the disk, it's more like a dd from the cd to the target system
[10:38] <kinja-sheep> joaopinto: Because he clicked the upgrading button on notification area, it went ahead to obtain 300 packages and no room.  So his system got b0rked.

[11:46] <iKernel> beruic, yes, but what happens if your hard drive screws up before you figure that out?
[11:46] <beruic> iKernel: Too dirty. Shouldn't happen too soon, just don't want it to wear out
[11:46] <trud> -> ubuntu can see hardware but none of sound...
[11:47] <LA-Snow> trud:  i've got an auzentech on my desktop.  ubuntu won't recognize that card and i just won't have sound in ubuntu, correct?
[11:48] <nariman_m> no one?? this is bugging me out! I've downloaded an old build (3.0) of virtualbox cuz I have issues with USB with the newest. I intall the deb, the setup confirms install complete. I go to appliocations system tools, nothing there! I run command "virtualbox" and terminal tells me that virtualbox is not currently installed!
[11:48] <Grunge> la-snow you can try googling drivers for it
[11:48] <Grunge> maybe there's a set that'll work
[11:48] <trud> well I have realtek audio card (on motherboard).... the sound is just not working
[11:49] <Grunge> trud i have realtek audio also
[11:49] <Grunge> mine works ifne
[11:49] <guntbert> nariman_m: its VirtualBox (case sensitive!)
[11:50] <trud> hmmm what kind of realtek do you have?
[11:50] <iKernel> beruic, have you tried find -f ?
[11:51] <nariman_m> guntbert: oh silly me
[11:52] <guntbert> nariman_m: :)
[11:52] <nariman_m> haha, this has been a pain in my ass for 3days

[11:54] <Xaero252> or can I write to the Overlay "display" from the x11-overlay using bash or something?
[11:54] <guntbert> nariman_m: try to edit the menu - sometimes it just doesn't get enabled
[11:54] <nariman_m> it launcher was there before, then I upgraded to virtualbox 3.1, and had USB issues, removed 3.1 and did a downgrade to 3.0.X and now no icon :)
[11:55] <trud> bloodski I have audio problem too, everything seems "working" but non of sound....
[11:55] <LA-Snow> do you think we'll see better audio support for linux in the future?  it's a shame because i love music and have to use windows to get quality
[11:55] <madPJKfan> anyone know anything about the dreaded VERR_ACCESS_DENIED error in virtual box?
[11:56] <guntbert> nariman_m: you know there is a channel #vbox ?

[12:00] <LA-Snow> does anyone know if an auzentech x-fi will work with linux using alsa?
[12:00] <Xaero252> weinmann: try doing a complete removal of samba and then reinstalling if "sudo dpkg-reconfigure samba"
[12:00] <Xaero252> LA-Snow: use the X-Fi Drivers for linux, and yes it will work
[12:00] <Xaero252> LA-Snow: at least it should
[12:00] <Xfact> anyone: can you tell me, where to download cool ubuntu logon screens....?
[12:00] <LA-Snow> Xaero252: interesting, i haven't been able to find any x-fi drivers for linux
[12:00] <weinmann> Xaero252 i removed it with --purge and still same if i try to use dpkg-reconfigure it says samba is broken
[12:00] <corecode> hey
[12:01] <Rovanion> Xfact: gnome-look.org
[12:01] <LA-Snow> Xaero252: on auzentech's site it doesn't support linux
[12:01] <corecode> i'm having a problem with my connected surround system
[12:01] <Xaero252> LA-Snow: http://opensource.creative.com/
[12:01] <corecode> i don't get any subwoofer signal until i go to sound preferences and switch the hardware configuration
[12:01] <Xfact> Rova...: thanks....
[12:01] <LA-Snow> Xaero252: thanks
[12:01] <LA-Snow> Xaero252: how does alsa relate to all of this?
[12:01] <corecode> then it works, but it is lost once rhythmbox opens a different file
[12:02] <Xaero252> LA-Snow, its a proprietary driver provided by creative, it should provide both Alsa and OSS compatibility for X-Fi chips, however, I'm not sure since yours is an Auzentech x-fi (uses an x-fi chip by creative) if the driver will control it properly, my X-Fi worked out of the box with 9.10
[12:02] <Xfact> anyone: What is actually 'artwork' for Ubuntu?
[12:03] <LA-Snow> Xaero252: your x-fi was a card made by creative?
[12:03] <kinja-sheep> weinmann: Try "sudo dpkg --configure -a"
[12:03] <monokrome> hey
[12:03] <weinmann> kinja-sheep tyvm seems to work :o
[12:03] <monokrome> I encrypted my home folder, and I don't remember the password... How can I get it back?
[12:03] <Xaero252> LA-Snow: yes, however the X-Fi chip should be the same, the only differences would be the rest of the semiconductors and the actually audio inputs and outputs
[12:03] <kinja-sheep> weinmann: Welcome. :o
[12:04] <guntbert> monokrome: no way - sorry
[12:04] <Rovanion> I'm getting errors while gtk-despotify, can someone figure out what's wrong, if I'm missing some package: http://pastebin.org/70981
[12:04] <monokrome> guntbert: What kind of encryption does it use?
[12:04] <Xaero252> monokrome: RSA encryption iirc, on a lighter note, you may be able to brute force it with a few TB's worth of rainbow tables :D
[12:05] <LA-Snow> Xaero252: i think you're correct.  reason i went with auzentech is to avoid the bloatware drivers that creative has for windows
[12:06] <Xfact> anyone: Do you think using too many effects for desktop will slow down the performance level?
[12:06] <monokrome> Xaero252: How long would that take?
[12:06] <ah7013> has anyone got nouveau working on powerpc on karmic
[12:06] <psycho_oreos> Xfact, depends mostly on hardware specs and the load levels
[12:07] <monokrome> Xaero252: http://ocaoimh.ie/is-rsa-encryption-broken/
[12:07] <Xfact> psycho_oreos: and I think mainly depends on graphics card... well, thanks for suggestion :)
[12:08] <psycho_oreos> Xfact, not really but mostly that yes
[12:08] <guntbert> monokrome: please see http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7568/1.html about the encryption technique
[12:08] <Tiders> How can I install Microsoft Office with Wine if I have no CD drive on my netbook
[12:08] <monokrome> ok. Thank you, guntbert.
[12:09] <Rovanion> Tiders: You use OpenOffice, or pirate MS office. Tough I don't see why you would want to do that
[12:09] <nariman_m> how do I unistall VMware?? I can't find it in synaptics and the command sudo vmware-uninstall.pl dosn't work
[12:09] <Jamed> Tiders: so ms office is on a CD?
[12:09] <monokrome> guntbert: Do you know if it's possible to encrypt an external drive in Ubuntu?
[12:10] <Tiders> Jamed, Yes
[12:10] <Xaero252> LA-Snow: Auzentech has put out a press release saying they won't be developing drivers for their X-Fi products, so just pray that the Creative driver works for your X-Fi chip, if not there was a thread here about a patch for the creative drivers: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/auzentech-x-fi-prelude-driver-drama-o-639709/
[12:10] <monokrome> guntbert: Never mind. I bet that's answered later in this article
[12:10] <Jamed> Tiders: try copying them on a usb stick on another pc and install from there
[12:11] <kinja-sheep> monokrome: You can encrypt anything.
[12:11] <monokrome> kinja-sheep: I mean, a drive that I already have data on
[12:12] <Tiders> What is that one command someone gave me yesterday to copy a CD to a .ISO file
[12:13] <kinja-sheep> monokrome: You'll have to move the data somewhere safely before you make a new encrypted partition.

[12:17] <deviad> Hello, I had a power outage and I had to hard-reset my computer because of a deadlock. With my surprise I saw no fsck being run on reboot. Is it normal?
[12:17] <corecode> the hardware config in sound preferences doesn't seem to work properly
[12:17] <corecode> anybody else having problems with surround sound?
[12:17] <kinja-sheep> Tiders: You know Brasero have the option to clone disc.
[12:17] <monokrome> deviad: fsck should only run if problems possibly existed at time of hard reboot, I think.
[12:18] <monokrome> I think it runs based on a journal check
[12:18] <deviad> I forgot that I'm using ext4, when I used ext3 I saw also a fsck running every  5 - 10 reboots..
[12:18] <deviad> .
[12:18] <deviad> so far I haven't seen fsck being run even once... that's weird to me
[12:18] <Tiders> Whats the best way to check disks for bad sectors?
[12:19] <monokrome> deviad: ext4 is probably better at handling this :)
[12:19] <Ctrl_Alt_Del> Tiders: smarmontools I would say

[12:20] <fosser> hello hackers, i am using ubuntu 9.04. i ust installed KompoZer. but it crashes after a min giving error segmentation fault. any patch or solution on this?
[12:21] <Rovanion> fosser: That is because the repos holds an old version
[12:21] <deviad> monokrome, I got worried because of some complaints about ext4 losing data
[12:21] <fosser> Rovanion: so if i installed latest version then problem will get solved?
[12:22] <monokrome> fosser: There is an article online that says they solved the problem by deleting their .komposer directory and restarting. I wouldn't recommend this, but moving it to something like .kompose.backup might be useful to test
[12:22] <Rovanion> fosser: I will not go into the stupidity of completely freezing the repos on launch of a distro. But rather provide you with this link that you may get a newer version: http://kompozer.net/download.php

[12:22] <monokrome> deviad: If you are worried, I would advise that you manually run fsck
[12:22] <Rovanion> fosser: Yes, indeed
[12:22] <deviad> monokrome, but I need to start it from a livecd right?
[12:22] <monokrome> deviad: Yea.
[12:22] <pozzy> can someone help me....i recently got rid of windows because it was destroying my computer.
[12:22] <pozzy> it works better than i could have expected, my comp is running much faster BUT when loading a page on mozilla it takes a long time...says its looking the page up
[12:23] <pozzy> takes much longer than normal
[12:23] <monokrome> deviad: I think you can force an fsck on reboot with: shutdown -rF now
[12:23] <pozzy> i tried arora but it takes even longer
[12:23] <monokrome> Just read an article that said that anyway
[12:23] <Rovanion> pozzy: Try a different browser such as Arora and see if it occurs en that browser too.
[12:24] <DaZ> pozzy: maybe it's dns issue
[12:24] <corecode> god, this surround issue is driving me crazy

[12:25] <Rovanion> Pay it forward and I'm all happy
[12:25] <fosser> yah sure
[12:25] <corecode> Xaero252: it is not doing proper surround until i go to sound properties and change the hardware config
[12:26] <Xaero252> corecode: is it not saving the settings for permanent use?
[12:26] <corecode> Xaero252: even though it remembers the hardware config, if playing a different song in rhythmbox, it won't be surround
[12:26] <corecode> Xaero252: so i have to select some other hardware config, like analog stereo, then it works.  then i can switch back to 5.1
[12:27] <corecode> Xaero252: happens for rhythmbox and totem
[12:27] <Xaero252> corecode: very strange... only rhythmbox and totem?

[12:43] <Xaero252> corecode: trying to see if you can do something similar for rhythmbox, I believe they both use gstreamer, so I would say configure gstreamer to use 5.1 if you can figure out how
[12:43] <bloodski> Xaero252: http://imagebin.org/78229
[12:43] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: applications >> Accesories >> terminal
[12:43] <corecode> Xaero252: thanks
[12:44] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: My ubuntu is in spanish; I don't know how is in yours
[12:44] <spacitymedic> English...
[12:44] <spacitymedic>  oj i copied ansd pasted it
[12:44] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: press enter, and put your password
[12:44] <spacitymedic>  it says a lot of stuff..... now... ldconfig deferred processing now taking place
[12:45] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: yes, is installing a library
[12:45] <spacitymedic>  now it says spacitymedic@hpnotebook2010:-$
[12:45] <spacitymedic> is t done now?
[12:45] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: Okay, it's done, now you need restart computer
[12:45] <spacitymedic> awesome
[12:45] <spacitymedic>  thansk so much...
[12:45] <BlouBlou> No problem, if you have got any problem join here again :)
[12:45] <Xaero252> bloodski: the far right side there is a muted S/pdif port, and theres also the potential that its on another "sound card" you can cycle through those with F6 if there is one for that audio control
[12:45] <spacitymedic>  uhm... is there a  list of fixes in the terminal for common probs?
[12:45] <spacitymedic> or should I just come ask you guys?
[12:46] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: First restart, I imagine it will work, but if it doesn't, just rejoin here
[12:46] <bloodski> Xaero252: only have default / nvidia / enter device name
[12:46] <spacitymedic> this fixes the audio and the videos playing too fast?
[12:46] <bloodski> Xaero252: how can i unmute it?
[12:46] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: yes, ubuntu came with alsa library, this replaced by pulseaudio one
[12:47] <Xaero252> bloodski: press M with it highlighted
[12:47] <spacitymedic> i have xbuntu
[12:47] <Xfact> I have a splash (tar.gz) screen can anyone tel me how to install it?
[12:47] <bloodski> thx Xaero252, i will go and check it out
[12:47] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: Is the same, xfce, kde, gnome.. are only graphial interfaces
[12:47] <spacitymedic> Oh ok
[12:47] <spacitymedic>  back in a flash
[12:47] <BlouBlou> okay :)
[12:47] <spacitymedic>  if I don;t come back, it worked. lol
[12:47] <spacitymedic> thabks blou
[12:47] <BlouBlou> heh ok

[12:49] <corecode> :/
[12:49] <bloodski> :)
[12:50] <corecode> i wonder why so few other people seem to have this problem
[12:50] <Xaero252> corecode: gstreamer-properties
[12:50] <Xaero252> corecode: run that in a terminal, change the output to 5.1 there
[12:50] <Xaero252> corecode: if you have the option for it
[12:51] <corecode> i guess i select pulseaudio
[12:51] <xrfang> I am using 9.10, my X server often crash without any hint (basically I encounter this about twice a week). I would like to find out the problem or report the bug, but don't know how to check -- e.g. what is the log to check for etc. any hint? thanks
[12:51] <corecode> Xaero252: can't select 5.1
[12:51] <Xfact> BlouBlou: it's a boot splash screen, it should be installed via GDM....what it's mean?
[12:52] <BlouBlou> Xfact: Ah, boot splash, sorry, I undertood login splash
[12:52] <Xfact> no ideas about boot splash.....
[12:52] <corecode> oh now i botched my gstreamer
[12:53] <spacitymedic> Blou....
[12:53] <spacitymedic>  Its not working
[12:53] <spacitymedic>  HELP
[12:53] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: mhhh
[12:53] <spacitymedic> lol
[12:53]  * BlouBlou thinking
[12:54] <spacitymedic> i should also mention i am a noob
[12:54] <spacitymedic> so... if I sound dunb/.... I am
[12:54] <spacitymedic>  and i cant spell today.
[12:54] <Xaero252> corecode: try #rhythmbox on irc.gnome.org
[12:54] <Xaero252> corecode: I'm at a loss as to where you could get surroundsound support from rhythmbox O.o
[12:54] <spacitymedic> who me/?
[12:55] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: Have you got another operative system installed, or a live cd? Oly for be sure that your sound problem is (x)ubuntu configuration and not hardware fail
[12:55] <corecode> Xaero252: well, upmix
[12:55] <corecode> Xaero252: i.e. use my subwoofer
[12:55] <spacitymedic> I have a live cd
[12:55] <ibm43> i want to install my asus eee pc 701 easypeasy
[12:55] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: Does sound work with it?
[12:55] <ibm43>  but get error
[12:55] <corecode> Xaero252: it is a stereo signal, but of course it should use my subwoofer
[12:56] <ibm43>  the ext3 file system creation in partition #5 of SCSI3 (0,0,0) (sdb) failed
[12:56] <spacitymedic> but thsi  was al working fine before i reinstalled xububtu after getting rid of kububtu
[12:56] <spacitymedic> it DID
[12:56] <doneill> corecode: are you using pulseaudio?
[12:56] <spacitymedic> i dunno
=== noot_ is now known as Nootilus
[12:56] <spacitymedic> hang on. i have to make a phone call... back in a few
[12:56] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: Okay
[12:56] <Ch3xO> yo
[12:56] <Ch3xO> yo yo.

[12:56] <ubottu> Ch3xO: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu! Feel free to ask questions and help people out. The channel guidelines are at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines. Enjoy your stay!
[12:57] <Xaero252> doneill: he only has surround issues with one application
[12:57] <corecode> doneill: yes, the default
[12:57] <Nootilus> hello I need a little help with ppas
[12:57] <corecode> Xaero252: i guess with all that use pulseaudio
[12:57] <doneill> Xaero252: sure, i just look for an excuse to blame pulseaudio.
[12:57] <spacitymedic> Ok.. i mback
[12:57] <spacitymedic>  so.... wlak me through it. what do I do?
[12:57] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: Have you installed anything before you get this error?
[12:58] <Narc> Hey folks, Happy New Year to all of you
[12:58] <doneill> what, again?  but we just had that...
[12:58] <spacitymedic> ok under preferences for hardware... what do I select
[12:58] <spacitymedic> i am not getting any error messages
[12:59] <spacitymedic> i downloaded some apps from the app adder thing
[12:59] <Nootilus> I'm trying to download conkyforecast but I can't understand how to authentify the source
[12:59] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: But have you got corrupt sound or simply not sound?
[12:59] <Xaero252> corecode: try changing from "Autodetect" to PulseAudio in gstreamer-properties... see if that fixes the sound issue in rhythmbox
[12:59] <spacitymedic> yeah just no sound
[13:00] <spacitymedic> ok I have selected pulse audio
[13:00] <spacitymedic> err wait
[13:00] <spacitymedic>  no...
[13:00] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: It's recommendabe stay it in automatic
[13:00] <jatt> I'm watching a movie. Stupid screensaver kicks in every 5 minutes. Is there a way to tell the screensaver to don't do that? (different than disabling it everytime I watch a movie).
[13:00] <spacitymedic> where do I select automatic
[13:00] <doneill> jatt: what are you playing the movie with?
[13:00] <Xaero252> Spacitymedic: that wasnt meant for you, it was meant for corecode to test out for rhythmbox
[13:01] <jatt> Flash movie (www.ted.com).
[13:01] <Nootilus> no one can help me?
[13:01] <BlouBlou> jatt: Move mouse every 4 minutes
[13:01] <jatt> ha
[13:01] <Xaero252> Nootilus: register an account with weather.com's xml service like it says in the directions
[13:01] <doneill> jatt: yeah, not really, since a flash applet doesn't talk to the power saver part of the PC..
[13:01] <jatt> I see.
[13:01] <spacitymedic> ok... i have under output: internal audio digital stereo (iec958) OR rs780 azalia controller digital stereo (hdmi)
[13:01] <Narc> I really need someone's help or opinion : Since I updated Karmic a week ago, my left click is not functioning properly anymore, it becomes unresponsive depending on which program I open, I can't click links or buttons, focus windows or anything. Mouse is fine, working on Windows, and xev is not detecting any event from the mouse. Thanks a lot.
[13:01] <doneill> jatt: but that isn't a linux thing, that's windows, mac, etc.
[13:01] <spacitymedic>  which do I choose
[13:01] <Xaero252> Nootilus: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=869328
[13:02] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: I'll check mine, one sec
[13:02] <corecode> Xaero252: fixed it!
[13:02] <kinja-sheep> jatt: Try "Inhibit Applet" -- Allows user to inhibit automatic power saving.
[13:02] <spacitymedic> tell me what i sunder each of ytour tabs'
[13:02] <spacitymedic>  pleeease
[13:02] <Nootilus> Xaero252, I'm not at this step, I just try to download the conkyforecast from http://ppa.launchpad.net/m-buck/ubuntu

[13:02] <doneill> kinja-sheep: nice idea
[13:02] <Xaero252> corecode: glad to hear it! hopefully that doesnt break any other gstreamer functionality
[13:02] <corecode> Xaero252: yep
[13:02] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: output tab
[13:02] <Nootilus> I added the deb line but I can't authentify
[13:03] <corecode> Xaero252: i wonder how to get this to developers' attention
[13:03] <spacitymedic> ok
[13:03] <corecode> oh now my volume mixer is gone?
[13:03] <corecode> how sad
[13:03] <Xaero252> corecode: file a bug on launchpad, and suggest a fix with it
[13:03] <Xaero252> corecode: just relaunch it
[13:03] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: Can you make a screenshoot and submit it please? Just for see wich configs have you got there
[13:03] <BlouBlou> !paste | spacitymedic

[13:03] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: Yes, it is, via local network or with different users?
[13:04] <spacitymedic> i am using home internet
[13:04] <spacitymedic> i ahve cablelynx
[13:05] <Narc> Anyone else experienced an almost non-functioning left-click after updating Karmic these days ?
[13:05] <spacitymedic> i dunno
[13:05] <spacitymedic>  i have vable internet... a wireless router... and Im the only computer on it.
[13:05] <spacitymedic>  well... my neighbor has a mag
[13:05] <spacitymedic>  mac... and he uses it but no one else
[13:05] <doneill> Narc: not me, but it could be related to your input method.
=== john is now known as Guest72188
[13:06] <doneill> Narc: what driver is your pointer device using in /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
[13:06] <madura> Narc, im not sure about it but look at the compiz settings if you have it enabled
[13:06] <Xaero252> corecode: gnome-volume-control doesnt work?
[13:06] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: So you want use your neighbors wifi?
[13:06] <Narc> doneill: I'm gonna check this, wait a seconde, thanks
[13:06] <Guest72188> john
[13:06] <spacitymedic> lol nooo
[13:07] <spacitymedic>  I am letting my neighbor use MY signal
[13:07] <Guest72188> joined
[13:07] <Narc> madura: I disabled it, I thought it was Compiz and Gnome-Do's fault, but even with effects disabled, it's still doing it
[13:07] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: ah
[13:07] <spacitymedic>  is there a way I can share my desktop with you, so you can see what I see?
[13:07] <spacitymedic> that was my question
[13:07] <spacitymedic> you know, to give you control so you can fix this?
[13:07] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: Yes, it is, but is needed open ports etc etc...
[13:07] <spacitymedic> Ok... so... tell me how to do it?
[13:07] <Xaero252> BlouBlou: not if his router has uPnP
[13:08] <Xaero252> and i would take that to PMs so that anybody harmful lurking in the channel cant access his VNC
[13:08] <BlouBlou> Xaero252: I'm via router and I'll need to forward ports
[13:08] <BlouBlou> Xaero252: Right
[13:08] <BlouBlou> spacitymedic: Private
[13:08] <Xaero252> BlouBloud: you dont need to forward ports to connect, just to serve
[13:08] <Xaero252> *BlouBlou
[13:09] <Narc> doneill: Driver entry says "mouse"....
[13:10] <Xaero252> BlouBlou: make sure he checks the Configure Network to Automatically accept connections box
[13:10] <meway> Hello my wine is not working can someone help me get it to work correctly?
[13:10] <doneill> narc: good old... "mouse" driver.
[13:10] <doneill> narc: you sure?
[13:10] <Xaero252> meway: whats your issue with wine?
[13:10] <meway> well I downloaded some packets and it uninstalled itself
[13:11] <meway> or it seems that way
[13:11] <doneill> "it takes naps and facebooks all day and won't get to work" :D
[13:11] <meway> Xaero252: any idea of why it may have done that?
[13:11] <Pici> !doesntwork
[13:11] <ubottu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[13:11] <Narc> doneill: Yes, sure. Plus, it worked fine since I installed Karmic, and on Jaunty too. But suddenly, last time I updated, I almost lost my left click.
[13:11] <Narc> It's all capricious now
[13:12] <doneill> Narc: do you have a Protocol and Device option set?
[13:12] <Narc> doneill: Ya, Protocol is set on "auto" and Device on "/dev/psaux"
[13:12] <Xaero252> meway: what exactly is it doing/not doing, does typing in wine on the terminal print usage remarks for wine? does typing winecfg bring up the wine configuration, could you have possibly installed a package dependant on the "wine" package and had the wine1.2 package installed and had your previous wine install get overwritten?
[13:13] <ope> I started my X11 using startx and run ratpoison as WM (for my thtv box). Anyway, If I put a USB stick into it's not mounted. Isn't mount done by hal???
[13:13] <meway> Xaero252:  I try to reinstall it and I get the following error
[13:13] <doneill> Narc: so it is a PS2 mouse?
[13:13] <meway> Xaero252:  Package dependencies cannot be resolved
[13:13] <commodoor> #pdo
[13:13] <meway> Xaero252:  This error could be caused by required additional software packages which are missing or not installable. Futhermore there could be a conflict between software packages which are not allowed to be installed at the same time.
[13:13] <Narc> doneill: No, it's a wireless USB trackball.
[13:13] <xiong> All kinds of things broke for me on the Karmic upgrade but I've decided not to blame the devs. I haven't been keeping good notes along the way, as I've been installing and customizing stuff; I haven't been making proper backups. So it's not clear, even to me, where my system was *before* the upgrade; it's no surprise that I'm having trouble with stuff now.
[13:14] <doneill> Narc: .. well there's yer prollum
[13:14] <doneill> Narc: try setting the device to /dev/input/mice
[13:14] <diddy> I have a strange problem on Ubuntu 9.10. Whenever I minimize Windows under Gnome the Window disappears. It is not minimized to the panel but is gone. What could be wrong and how can I fix it?
[13:14] <doneill> Narc: also, i've had best experience using evdev lately
[13:14] <corecode> Xaero252: nope, not fixed
[13:14] <corecode> Xaero252: dunno why it worked
[13:14] <Narc> doneill: Oh, I see. I'm gonna do this and restart X, right ?
[13:14] <meway> Xaero252: The problem just occured after looking threw a forum to get my DVD's to work with vlc media player
[13:15] <corecode> Xaero252: i think i broke pulseaudio, so gstreamer used alsa directly
[13:15] <Narc> doneill: But why did it worked fine before then ?
[13:15] <doneill> Narc: you don't have to
[13:15] <doneill> Narc: in a terminal run: xsetpointer /dev/input/mice
[13:15] <Xaero252> corecode: undo what you did O.o
[13:15] <corecode> Xaero252: yea
[13:15] <doneill> Narc: i have no idea, but /dev/psaux is for ps2 mice.
[13:15] <petsounds> diddy, make sure that window selector is available on gnome panel.
[13:16] <corecode> Xaero252: now i have sound + volume, but again no subwoofer
[13:16] <doneill> Narc: just because the horse drove the truck once doesn't mean it made any sense.
[13:16] <diddy> petsounds, how?
[13:16] <Xaero252> corecode: but audio from all 5 speakers?
[13:16] <Narc> doneill: Haha, true
[13:16] <l4ng1t> anyone knows software remote desktop through NAT?
[13:16] <corecode> Xaero252: no
[13:16] <Xaero252> meway: I'm not certain but you must have installed a package that requires something that conflicts with a package wine requires
[13:16] <doneill> Narc: "xsetpointer -l" should list valid devices for xinput too
[13:16] <meway> Xaero252:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
[13:17] <Xaero252> corecode: so we are back to square one?
[13:17] <corecode> Xaero252: indeed
[13:17] <corecode> Xaero252: well it seems to be a pulseaudio issue
[13:17] <Narc> doneill: Ok, I'll try it then, thanks a lot
[13:17] <doneill> corecode: i'd purge pulseaudio
[13:17] <corecode> i'd rather fix it
[13:18] <doneill> corecode: what do you use pulseaudio for?
[13:18] <corecode> i have no idea
[13:18] <Narc> doneill: I'm gonna reboot and see if it works.
[13:18] <doneill> me either..
[13:18] <corecode> does alsa mix several sound channels?
[13:18] <doneill> corecode: yep.
[13:18] <Xaero252> doneill: I use pulse audio because alsa fails at mixing imho
[13:18] <doneill> corecode: in and out
[13:19] <doneill> Xaero252: pulse audio fails and .. doing.. any.. audio
[13:19] <Xaero252> doneill: and it also won't let a game "lock" the audio device *cough* Stepmania's horrible codebase *cough*
[13:19] <doneill> s/and/at/
[13:19] <petsounds> diddy, you can add the Window Selector if you want.
[13:20] <doneill> the only good thing about pulseaudio is that it isn't *quite* as invasive on my PC as avahi.
[13:20] <Xaero252> I need sleep ><
=== Cobi is now known as Guest88912
[13:20] <meway> Xaero252:  wait i think this is what did it sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2
[13:20] <doneill> but from where i come from, adding steps to debugging, configuration, and management, is NOT the best way to 'make my life easier', which both pulseaudio and avahi do, with zero benefit to me even when they are working properly.
[13:21] <Xaero252> I wonder... !sleep
[13:21] <meway> Xaero252: how do i get rid of sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2
[13:21] <Xaero252> meway: type libdvdcss2 in the search box on synaptic
[13:21] <meway> Xaero252: command to uninstall? don't care if it breaks vlc dvd's
[13:21] <meway> Xaero252 :( k
[13:22] <Xaero252> meway or you can do it via command line sudo apt-get remove libdvdcss2
[13:22] <meway> kk
[13:22] <Xaero252> I'm going to bed now though, I need some sleep
[13:23] <Xaero252> gnight
[13:23] <diddy> petsound, you mean without it I would experience the problems that I see?
[13:23] <meway> Xaero252 nope same error I will have to look into more :(
[13:23] <meway> Xaero252 gtg thanks for trying :)
[13:24] <meway> Xaero252 well actually you know any program that will get my ipod to work without wine?
[13:24] <Narc> doneill: Thanks for your help, but it doesn't work. Left click's dead again.
[13:24] <diddy> petsound, I think that worked. You rock! Thx
[13:24] <meway> anyone know of a program that will get my ipod to work?
[13:25] <diddy> petsounds, I think that worked. You rock! Thx
[13:25] <meway> nvm later
[13:25] <doneill> Narc: that's pretty bizarre
[13:25] <doneill> Narc: do your other USB devices work properly?
[13:25] <Narc> doneill: I'm used to bizarre bugs
[13:25] <Narc> doneill: Yes, I think so
[13:25] <petsounds> diddy, np :-)
[13:27] <Narc> doneill: The keyboard is PS2 so I can't tell, but the webcam and stuff works fine
[13:30] <Narc> doneill: I read about HAL messing up the mouse ans keyboard but it doesn't look like it. The Alt-Tab combo doesn't work either.
[13:31] <doneill> Narc: well, alt tab doesn't work reliably for me either with compiz on
[13:31] <Narc> doneill: Oh, ok. But the strange thing is that it doesn't work even with Compiz off I think.
[13:32] <doneill> Narc: i'm starting to think something isn't working properly with your PC, peripherals, or software, but that is merely a hunch.
[13:32] <doneill> unfortunately without physically sitting down at your terminal and fiddling with it, i don't think i can come up with any suggestions.
[13:33] <doneill> have you tried surfing ubuntu forums for similar issues?
[13:33] <brianherman> meway: what generation ipod
[13:33] <Narc> doneill: Yes, and the only people who experienced it are laptop users or beta testers
[13:34] <doneill> well, your input device isn't much different from a laptop trackball, how did they fix it?
[13:35] <Narc> doneill: I thought it was update related 'cause it happened right after I updated, but can be a coincidence
[13:35] <Narc> doneill: They didn't.
[13:35] <doneill> oh i imagine it is an update issue
[13:35] <Narc> doneill: They waited for a fix to come up.
[13:35] <doneill> as a last ditch effort, you could move your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old and restart X
[13:35] <ondra> hi
[13:36] <doneill> that would force it to reconfigure

[13:59] <ryker> kinja-sheep: I saw a 12.x version available for Jaunty on the packages site.  I'm fairly new to ubuntu.  Is there usually any issue with grabbing an old package from Jaunty and using it on Karmic?

[14:04] <despen> LucidPerry: Nope, single sata drive and one ata dvdrom
[14:04] <kinja-sheep> ryker: You could enable the backport kernel if that will help your wifi issues.

[14:06] <Dr_Willis> !ipod
[14:06] <ubottu> For information on how to sync and add tracks to your iPod, see the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IPodHowto - For the iPhone and the iPod Touch, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone - See !RockBox for information on liberating your iPod
[14:06] <ondra> ondra, yes, that should solve the problem, hence the device works fine in jaunty and karmic, how to "backport the kernel"
[14:07] <mkanyicy> SuperRoach, rhythmbox works well, i am suprised that amarok is not working
[14:07] <kinja-sheep> ondra: By installing "linux-backports-modules-karmic"

[14:08] <ubottu> ondra: The core of the Ubuntu Operating System is the Linux kernel: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel - You shouldn't have to compile your own, but if you're convinced you do, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile - See also: /msg ubottu stages
[14:09] <kinja-sheep> ondra: Read the first statement.
[14:09] <kinja-sheep> ondra: By installing it, you're using backport kernels which may contains more supports for your hardwares.
[14:10] <ondra> kinja-sheep, ok, I will give it a try
[14:10] <kinja-sheep> ondra: Many users have came in with weird occasional wireless problems (irony, just like you) and enabling the backport kernel often did the trick for them.  Okay. :)

[14:14] <gdb> Milp: That's by design.  You have one running that's the master that's listening for connections.  Every connection made forks off another copy with a lowered privilege.  It's a security feature of openssh.
[14:15] <MindSpark> how do I find out if the cpu is 32 or 64 bit ?
[14:15] <LucidPerry> MindSpark: If you're on Ubuntu, in terminal, type "sudo lscpu"
[14:15] <bertalan> sziasztok
[14:15] <Milp> gdb: But i only have one open connection to it at the moment, there are like 6 running though
[14:16] <Andycaps> Can i use older gcc to build a package? The gcc-4.4 gives me errors on make
[14:16] <MindSpark> LucidPerry, ok, and which field  says about 32/64 ?
[14:17] <LucidPerry> MindSpark: It should say "Architecture:" and then x86 or x86-64. But actually I'd recommend running less /proc/cpuinfo instead. It's more detailed.
[14:17] <gdb> Milp: Ah, that I don't know then.  Do you have any other ssh connections open using something other than ssh?  (ie; sftp, scp, etc?)
[14:17] <MindSpark> LucidPerry, that's what I did at first, but nothing really says that
[14:17] <LucidPerry> MindSpark: Well, what does it say for "model name"?
[14:18] <MindSpark> LucidPerry, Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz
[14:19] <LucidPerry> MindSpark: P4s came in both 32 and 64bit. So...back to lscpu. If you got "x86" for Architecture, it's 32bit. If you got x86-64, it's 64bit.
[14:19] <Dr_Willis> what? Intel dosent call it AMD64? :)

[14:27] <mkanyicy> MindSpark, I never used 64 bit before, so I am clueless in that field

[14:37] <Dr_Willis> agus:  well tjhe older releases are still avail. but the repos have all been moved to some less used archive server. and you basically are on your own with any support issues with them. You would need to edit your sources.list to point to the right server

[14:37] <bitplane> Halvor, on 9.10 the flash player is in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so
[14:37] <scunizi> Dr_Willis: agus is looking to do a multi-station from one pc.. Lisp? Ltsp? I forgot what they call it.. but one pc with multiple monitors keyboards mice etc.. used a lot in the educational environment.
[14:38] <ondra> kinja-sheep, it seems like backports did not help
[14:38] <bitplane> try "killall firefox" from a command line and restart firefox afterwards
[14:38] <kinja-sheep> ondra: Oh noes.
[14:38] <lowki> biznock09: cd ~/.Trash
[14:38] <mbeierl> Anyone know of a legal video player that can play the "digital copy" cds that come with some dvds?  I have the original cd and its decryption key, just no way to play it... :(
[14:38] <Dr_Willis> scunizi:  thers another way to do it also.. that is more up to date.. its free for 2 stations - charges for more.
[14:39] <scunizi> Dr_Willis: oh?  got a link?
[14:39] <Halvor> bitplane: Appreciate the help so far. Hopefully I won't be back immediately afterwards...
[14:39] <bitplane> mbeierl, it's defective by design I'm afraid. I doubt you'll find a legal player
[14:39] <kinja-sheep> ondra: "sudo lshw -c network" --- Pastebinit, plz.
[14:40] <kinja-sheep> ondra: I'll try and find you a solution.
[14:40] <agus> btw, what old version of ubuntu that the repo still available?
[14:40] <mbeierl> Ah.  I see - better to "make a backup copy of the dvd" than attempt to legally play what I own.  Yep.  Defective by design
[14:40] <klown> anyone else have an issue with pastebinit posting the wrong url?
[14:40] <klown> last night it happened to me twice.
[14:40] <ondra> kinja-sheep, it writer sort of help...

[14:42] <Dr_Willis> bye all bbl

[14:42] <lowki> biznock09: you can from the installation cd

[14:43] <biznock09> lowki, i have no drive
[14:43] <lowki> gotta find your trash though
[14:43] <kinja-sheep> ondra: "lsmod | grep rt" turns up anything?

[14:44] <scunizi> Dr_Willis: that's not bad.. I wonder when docs will be out for multiseatX on 9.10+.. of course with gnome 3.0 coming up there's major changes there too.
[14:44] <lowki> do you see a .Trash ? or .local ?

[14:52] <Danskmand> Howdy :-) - Has someone here tried to install Domino on Ubuntu ? - maybe also as a esx-guest ?
[14:52] <Milp> Like who connects, who failed to enter the password and such, because i suspect that something malicious is going on
[14:53] <mbeierl> Milp: that should be /var/log/auth.log

[14:53] <bastidrazor> lowki: ctrl sysrq k
[14:54] <bastidrazor> lowki: may be alt instead of ctrl..
[14:54] <mbeierl> Milp: there's usually tons logged there - like cron an so forth - whenever sudo occurs, etc.
[14:54] <lowki> bastidrazor: thanks
[14:54] <Dunkirk> Is there a way to `apt-get upgrade' only the security-related packages?
[14:55] <lowki> Dunkirk: nah don't do it
[14:55] <ZykoticK9> lowki, it is alt+sysrq(usually printscreen)+k to restart X in 9.10 (as bastidrazor eventually suggested)
[14:55] <lowki> Dunkirk: can get the updates
[14:55] <lowki> instead
[14:55] <prince> how to run java applet in ubuntu while i try to run using the command appletviewer filename.java as i do in xp it got error AppletViewer properties file: /home/prince/.hotjava/properties Using defaults.

[14:57] <lowki> does linux mint have the same problems as 9.10?
[14:57] <bitplane> Travis-42, i'm also using a logitech mouse and it seems to work okay here
[14:57] <schilli> Dunkirk: I think the upgrade manager has an option that automatically does the security updates.
[14:58] <prince> can help me to solve how to run java applet in ubuntu while i try to run using the command appletviewer filename.java as i do in xp it got error AppletViewer properties file: /home/prince/.hotjava/properties Using defaults.

[14:58] <bitplane> sounds*
[14:58] <Dunkirk> schilli, I see that I can turn off the "standard" updates, and just leave the "security" ones, but it begs a couple more questions...
[14:58] <Halvor> bitplane: I'm back. No issues resolved.
[14:58] <bitplane> ouch Halvor :(
[14:58] <lool_> how does internet

[14:59] <Teknkik> hi, how i can install ltsp after the installation of the base system?
[14:59] <lowki> cause this 9.10 is broken
[14:59] <bitplane> Halvor, can you see the flash plugin in the Firefox plugins list?
[15:00] <ZykoticK9> lowki, there is no supported method to "downgrade" after installing 9.10 - if you want to go back to 9.04 you need to clean install [don't forget to backup you files!]
[15:00] <Dunkirk> lowki, what's broken about 9.10?
[15:00] <Milp> mbeierl i found out what was causing this, a bug in the syslog conf template caused the logs to be logged in the wrong location ;)
[15:00] <schilli> Dunkirk:  I don't know.  I just threw that out because I thought it might help.
[15:00] <craigbass1976> I'm numbing it.  How do I remount nfs shares that are already in fstab ?
[15:00] <bastidrazor> Dunkirk: you could comment out the repo's you don't want.. that is one way to do what you're wanting
[15:00] <bastidrazor> craigbass1976: sudo mount -a

[15:01] <craigbass1976> bastidrazor, thanks
[15:01] <Milp> mbeierl now finally ossec also logs the sshd problems :D yay
[15:01] <Dunkirk> lowki, Ouch.
[15:01] <bastidrazor> Dunkirk: be sure to do an sudo apt-get update after editing sources.list

[15:05] <Dunkirk> lowki, Have you created an /etc/X11/xorg.conf, or are you just letting X configure itself?
[15:05] <prince> my program compile sucess but while i run using appletviewer filename.java its give me warning

I'm on Ubuntu Karmic, and running Skype 2.0.0.72, since I couldn't get the latest version to work with my USB microphone.  If I have Skype running, no other programs will produce sound (i.e. Amarok, vlc, flash in the browser, etc.).  If any of those programs are active when I start skype, skype will fail to produce sound & won't work properly.  Is there a way I can allo
[15:05] <Xepera> w side-by-side usage of skype, as all my other programs seem to get along just fine when it comes to sharing audio...
[15:06] <Dunkirk> lowki, I would try an `Xorg -configure' and let X tell you what it thinks it sees.
[15:06] <karleeto> is there like a big font pack i can install?? or do most people just copy the windows/fonts directory into their ubuntu installation?

[15:07] <prince> my program compile sucess but while i run using appletviewer filename.java its give me warning how i get rid off this
[15:07] <Xepera> karleeto: most people copy the windows fonts.  There are many font packs available on torrent sites, but keep in mind that some of them are not freeware
[15:07] <Dunkirk> lowki, Also, pay attention to the mouse device. You might be needing to use the event device (/dev/event/mice), rather than psaux.
[15:07] <lowki> Dunkirk: says X server already active
[15:07] <brummbaer> karleeto: sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
[15:07] <brummbaer> it'll get the usual MS fonts installed.
[15:08] <Dunkirk> lowki, Yeah, you'll have to do it at the command line. Switch to a command prompt with ctrl-alt-f1, and then /etc/init.d/gdm stop.
[15:08] <karleeto> brummbaer: thanks!
[15:08] <Xepera> seems my skype audio question is out of the realm of general expertise lol
[15:08] <karleeto> Xepera: i'm comfortable with downloading a pirated font set, i'll look that up too ;)
[15:08] <karleeto> thanks folks!
[15:09] <Dunkirk> lowki, This will kill your X session. It would help to have a nother computer nearby for Googling while you tweak your config...

[15:09] <Dunkirk> lowki, YOu can test your modifications without starting gdm again by just doing `startx'.
[15:09] <Halvor> Mozilla = Firefox
[15:09] <Xepera> Halvor: You can go into Synaptic and install flashplugin-nonfree

[15:10] <Halvor> Xepera: What/where is synaptic?
[15:10] <corecode> oh wow, ext4 is so slow
[15:10] <Xepera> Halvor: are you on Kubuntu or Ubuntu?
[15:10] <bitplane> Halvor, it's the advanced package manager found in the system menu

[15:10] <Xepera> Halvor: press ALT+F2 & type "synaptic" (without quotes) and press enter
[15:10] <brummbaer> yeah, karleeto, you should also look up 'free ttf fonts' and 'install ttf ubuntu', if you're using fonts for graphics, there are some spiff free graphics sites out there. :)

[15:12] <bitplane> I mean, what card.. I'm just guessing that it's the problem anyway
[15:12] <bitplane> dt3k, is docky the Apple wannabe thing?

[15:14] <mdk_> i installed through envy, and throught the restricted and via tty1 with the downloaded drivers
[15:15] <Halvor> Xepera: 'flashplugin-nonfree' has a green checkbox. I guess that means it is somehow in the system already?

[15:16] <hiatus> why not install ubuntu restricted extras like everyone else?
[15:16] <kinja-sheep> hiatus: The way I see it... preload caches all running applications so it knows ten popular applications and is "ready" to load anytime.  And readahead rearrange the boot files to shave a blink.

[15:19] <lowki> Dunkirk: i keep my backups on my server
[15:19] <eurythmia_> Dunkirk, gentoo *is* good ... if you're worried about code optimized for your processor, go with gentoo, but ubuntu is really slick and has a lot of support options.
[15:19] <ner0x> Anyone here using Pg and know what this *new* error is?
[15:19] <brummbaer> karleeto: i would never tell you to google something, you should 'yahoo' it.
[15:19] <brummbaer> :)
[15:19] <bitplane> Halvor, open a console and type "cd /usr/ && find | grep flashplayer.so"
[15:19]  * thiebaude but dont bing it,lol
[15:20] <Dunkirk> eurythmia_, I tried using the Phoronix test suite over the weekend, I got NO DIFFERENCE between Ubuntu amd64 and my "custom" Gentoo setup. On the exact same machine, mind you.
[15:20] <eurythmia_> bitplane, woah ... that's a time consuming command.
[15:20] <dt3k> Good lord I have to do all that just to get on a domain? Sheesh
[15:20] <Dunkirk> eurythmia_, So a lot of my thinking about why I should stick with Gentoo just flew out the window.
[15:20] <bitplane> eurythmia yeah I know, I'm lazy so the computer can work more
[15:20] <eurythmia_> Dunkirk, did you recompile everything on gentoo with -O3 ? ;)
[15:20] <eurythmia_> bitplane, locate flashplayer.so  :P
[15:20] <Pici> bitplane: Why not use find properly by doing: find /usr/ -name "flashplayer.so"
[15:20] <marcel__> Hi !
[15:20] <Xepera> Halvor: did you restart your browser?
[15:21] <biznock09> can anyone help change a user password
[15:21] <Dunkirk> eurythmia_, No, I always use "safe" CFLAGS, with -02. So, yeah, I could probably squeeze something, but I haven't seen any gain yet.
[15:21] <eurythmia_> with locate, you have to run updatedb once in a while, but you can get chron to do that for you.
[15:21] <Pici> biznock09: Provide some more information and we might be able to? What user? What have you tried?
[15:21] <Halvor> Xepera: I did
[15:21] <Halvor> bitplane: I get to filepaths
[15:21] <Dunkirk> eurythmia_, I suppose you're going to tell me that Ubuntu already uses -O2, and I should have been at -O3 on Gentoo to see any gains...
[15:21] <eurythmia_> Dunkirk, then my suggestion is to go with ubuntu, it's a lot easier to administer, it's pretty, and there is lots of documentation and how tos.
[15:21] <patdk-wk> heh, I hate locate/updatedb :) just a waste of cpu/hd cycles to me
[15:22] <eurythmia_> Dunkirk, I don't know that for sure, but I suspect so.
[15:22] <eurythmia_> patdk-wk, get cron to run it while you sleep :P
[15:22] <biznock09> Pici: its just my user password
[15:22] <eurythmia_> patdk-wk, it sure saves time if you need to find things a lot.
[15:22] <Pici> biznock09: And you forgot it?
[15:22] <patdk-wk> eurythmia_, oh ya, when it takes locate 8hours to run
[15:22] <biznock09> Pici: no i have it i want to change it
[15:22] <patdk-wk> and if it's a vm system that has 10+ of them running :(
[15:22] <bitplane> Halvor, are they in /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins and /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/ ?
[15:22] <Pici> biznock09: on a terminal type: passwd
[15:22] <Xepera> Halvor: Are you on an i686 (32-bit) or AMD64 (64-bit) system?
[15:22] <patdk-wk> I can't remember ever using locate
[15:22] <eurythmia_> patdk-wk, it also depends how much stuff you have on your computer to catalog, I guess :P
[15:23] <Dunkirk> Check it out: http://google.com/trends?q=fedora|redhat%2Cgentoo%2Copensuse|suse%2Cubuntu|debian%2Cfreebsd|openbsd|netbsd
[15:23] <prince> finally i got the ans
[15:23] <Pici> !ot | Dunkirk
[15:23] <ubottu> Dunkirk: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics. Thanks!
[15:23] <Dunkirk> I'm thinking Ubuntu will BE Linux in a couple more years...
[15:23] <Halvor> Xepera: Neither
[15:23] <thiebaude> pc-bsd
[15:23] <patdk-wk> Dunkirk, extreemly unlikely
[15:23] <biznock09> Pici: thanks for your patience
[15:23] <Halvor> bitplane: No, cd /usr/ && find | grep flashplayer.so and cd /usr/ && find | grep flashplayer.so
[15:23] <Xepera> Halvor: Okay, SPARC?  What kind of system are you using?
[15:23] <eurythmia_> thiebaude, what about it?
[15:23] <thiebaude> its great
[15:24] <thiebaude> offtopic, sorry
[15:24] <Halvor> Xepera: I think it's a P4 pr P5
[15:24] <eurythmia_> thiebaude, I run freeBSD on one of my lappys :{D
[15:24] <lowki> hey what's the minimum size the root partition can be?
[15:24] <thiebaude> cool
[15:24] <Halvor> Xepera: I'd have to check
[15:24] <Xepera> Halvor: That's "i686"
[15:24] <patdk-wk> lowki, 1meg?
[15:24] <thiebaude> graphical installer is the only difference
[15:24] <eurythmia_> looks like I have to restart X to get my mouse working again.Be back soon.
[15:24] <hiatus> ubuntu is basically doing what fedora was supposed to do
=== Super_Roach is now known as SuperRoach
[15:25] <patdk-wk> lowki, can be much smaller if your not using ext2/3/4
[15:25] <Pici> This isn't a discussion channel, if you're not here to answer or ask support questions, then you can chat in #ubuntu-offtopic.  Thanks!
[15:25] <Doonz> hey guys im having trouble getting a crontab job to run. i can run the script by just typing the script in terminal as the user. but when i wait for contrab to run it it never runs
[15:26] <Halvor> bitplane: I'll make a second attempt. The files are ./lib/flashplugin-nonfree/libflashplayer.so and ./lib/adobe-flashplugin/libflashplayer.so
[15:26] <Pici> Doonz: What does the entry in your crontab look like?
[15:26] <kinja-sheep> Doonz: Full path to the script.
[15:26] <patdk-wk> doonz, probably cause your missing paths to the programs in your cron script
[15:26] <Dunkirk> Doonz, is your cron daemon running?
[15:26] <Doonz> * * * * * /home/tvshows/.runme
[15:26] <Doonz> Dunkirk:  yes
[15:26] <bitplane> Halvor, looks like it's not in the firefox plugins directory. strange
[15:26] <Doonz> tvshows@fast:~$ ps ax | grep 'cron' 908 ?        Ss     0:00 cron
[15:27] <deviad> Hey guys, is there any how to that helps to configure properly pulseaudio?
[15:27] <deviad> I have been away from Linux for 2 - 3 years and I found this new stuff. I'm getting problems with it on my mac
[15:27] <occy> When I type:  sudo su -      It gives me "Error"  that's it nothing else.  any ideas?
[15:27] <Halvor> bitplane: I hope that can be workd around somehow
[15:27] <deviad> I can hear the sound but when I record my voice and I play the recording it sounds choppy...
=== chaky_ is now known as chaky
[15:28] <jpds> occy: Use: sudo -i
[15:28] <deviad> scratchy...
[15:28] <deviad> stuttering I guess is the right word...
[15:28] <kinja-sheep> deviad: How do you know your voice does not sound choppy? o.O
[15:28] <bitplane> Halvor, you shouldn't have to work around it, but I guess you could
[15:28] <occy> jpds: has  su - been deprecated?
[15:28] <Halvor> bitplane: Just direct me to the smoothest solution and I'll be most happy :-)
[15:28] <deviad> kinja-sheep, when I play the recording there's some sort of stuttering...
[15:28] <jpds> occy: No, you should have never used it.
=== sniper is now known as Guest3724
[15:29] <lowki> is there a console app, that opens a file based on file type?
[15:29] <jpds> occy: Well, sudo -i does what it does.
[15:29] <kinja-sheep> deviad: You could try padevchooser
[15:29] <occy> jpds: odd I've been doing that since...  96?
[15:29] <lowki> like double clicking in the browser?
[15:29] <Guest3724> #linuasc
[15:29] <jpds> occy: Ubuntu has always used sudo?
[15:29] <lowki> jpds: yes
[15:29] <Doonz> patdk-wk: the path is correct
[15:29] <plustax> okay I have my final fantasy playstation disc here, and I have pcsx. How to use it? Evertime I put it in pcsx tells me its not a valid playstation disc!
[15:29] <occy> jpds:  well  I've always used the    su -    when becoming root.
[15:30] <Halvor> I'm using the web interface for IRC. Is there some way I can not see all the joins and quits in the channel?
[15:30] <occy> hence:  sudo su -      would allow me to become root.  Anyhoo the odd thing is... why does it give me a generic "Error"  heh
[15:30] <bitplane> Halvor, remove the package from apt and install it manually from Adobe's website
[15:30] <kinja-sheep> Halvor: Turn off the join/quit feature in your Web Interface (if it exists).

[15:30] <macman_> mirc on linux rocks :P
[15:31] <hiatus> mirc on linux?
[15:31] <kinja-sheep> mirc on linux? :(
[15:31] <Halvor> bitplane: What's 'apt'?
[15:31] <Guest3724> yes what apt
[15:31] <bitplane> Halvor, the package manager.. wherever you installed it from
[15:31] <Guest3724> ?????
[15:32] <hiatus> macman: use xchat or at least pidgin. if your hardcore, use irssi
[15:32] <bitplane> aptitude is the command line linux package manager... you use "apt-get" to install stuff. all those GUI tools use that in the background I think
[15:32] <oph3lia> irssi is nice
[15:32] <Halvor> bitplane: I installed it from Firefox, but the problem is that it isn't recognized in Firefox
[15:32] <oph3lia> simple and without the fancy eyesores :)
[15:32] <bitplane> Halvor, just remove it from the applications menu
[15:32] <bitplane> and install from the website instead
[15:33] <LucidPerry>  Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)
[15:33] <Doonz> hey guys im having trouble getting a crontab job to run. i can run the script by just typing the script in terminal as the user. but when i wait for contrab to run it it never runs
[15:33] <LucidPerry> :P
[15:33] <Halvor> bitplane: I don't see flashplayer in the applications menu. Would a plugin even appear there?
[15:34] <Guest3724> thank you
[15:34] <Halvor> bitplane: I can try and remove it it Synaptic
[15:34] <bitplane> Halvor, the package installer/remover program, search in there
[15:35] <bitplane> or synaptic if it's not there (it's always best to avoid that if possible)
[15:35] <mun_> hi
[15:35] <mun_> does anyone know what ng means in names like aircrack-ng, initng?
[15:35] <urthmover> ng = no good?
[15:35] <erUSUL> mun_: usually new generation
[15:36] <mun_> i see.
[15:36] <mun_> thanks
[15:36] <erUSUL> mun_: as in is newer rewriten better
[15:36] <Halvor> bitplane: I just got the advise that synaptic was the preferrable tool for this type of work. Are you saying it should rather be avoided?
[15:36] <mun_> erUSUL, how is it conventionally pronounced? aircrack-'N''G' spelt out?
[15:37] <DexterF> in /etc/default/grub is not one sinlge entry mentioned. where are my debian, ubuntu, windows lines?
[15:37] <bitplane> Halvor, it's a bit more in-depth and you can work around things. I prefer to avoid it myself, but I'm no expert
[15:37] <erUSUL> mun_: dunno; sorry english is not even my native language
[15:37] <mun_> ah ok thanks

[15:38] <leissi> sup
[15:38] <leissi> back on ubuntu again :P
[15:38] <Halvor> bitplane: Well, I don't see that 'aptitude' utility which you mentioned.
[15:39] <oph3lia> Halvor, you can use aptitude instead of apt-get
[15:39] <oph3lia> if you so prefer
[15:39] <luist> hm... is it possible to install ubuntu in an external HD and boot from it?
[15:39] <Halvor> oph3lia: Now I have no idea what you are referring to. I'm not sure I have any of thos programs.
[15:40] <bitplane> Halvor, just use synaptic package manager. aptitude is the command line version
=== jmburges1 is now known as jmburgess
[15:40] <Halvor> bitplane: OK. Should I do 'Removal' or 'Complete removal'?
[15:41] <bitplane> I'm not sure of the difference, but try removal for starters
[15:41] <jakemills> When I installed the proprietary drivers for my modem on this laptop (never use it but just did it for completeness) the sound stopped working. Is this a known issue with modem drivers in ubuntu?

[15:45] <Halvor> bitplane: Can you advise on which version of Adobe flashplayer to select? There are a Linux version to choose from, specifically two for ubuntu (One for 8.0.4+ which I have and one for 9.0.4+)
[15:45] <Doonz> hey guys im having trouble getting a crontab job to run. i can run the script by just typing the script in terminal as the user. but when i wait for contrab to run it it never runs
