[19:41] <ikonia> but he'll have to make the modifications suggested
[19:42] <Ramtron> I suppose ubuntu has it set to off on default, there's an extension to enable backspace :D
[19:43] <root________> ikonia: I'm really hoping someone in an enterprise environment has an iso with exactly these modiciations that they can share a link to, to save me from fumbling around with tthe unfamiliar iso command and attempting to troubleshoot without a known-good iso.
[19:44] <Bsims> root________: what are you trying to do?
[19:44] <mhahe> i just played with display settings while i had an HDMI connected and i set my laptop display to off.. so now everytime i put in the HDMI the setting takes effect and only resets on restart... how do i get rid of this setting or restore to defaults?
[19:44] <ikonia> very doubtful
[19:45] <root________> Bsims: install ubuntu server on a completely headless system remotely over SSH
[19:45] <Ramtron> Sounds entirely too complicated
[19:45] <Bsims> root________: Ah you will wish to do server install... and most likely will need the bootstrap files for the install on the remote server
[19:47] <Bsims> root________: http://serverfault.com/questions/208128/how-to-remotely-install-linux-via-ssh
[19:49] <root________> Bsims: I already linked to the exact steps that need to be performed in my original question.  I just lack the comfort with the tools to be comfortable attempting to follow the guide myself, and to attempt to troubleshoot the system when I don't even know if the ISO is of known good quality
[19:49] <Bsims> Ah for that, just do a md5sum on the iso
[19:50] <root________> Bsims: can you type "/lastlog root________" and read my initial question again please?
[19:51] <Bsims> your inital question was after I had joined sorry, you will have to paste it again
[19:51] <Sheikhmak> hey kids, how can i turn this command into a /etc/fstab rule? mount -o proto=tcp,port=2049 grinder:/ /mnt/nfs/
[19:52] <ikonia> Sheikhmak: that looks like an NFS mount
=== carlos is now known as Guest3810
=== Guest3810 is now known as Ripper
[19:52] <ikonia> just add it like a normal fstab entry host:share and set the file system to nfs
[19:52] <root________> Bsims: Can anyone provide a ubuntu netinst iso that launches an openssh server after network config and then waits, by default?  Preferably from a corporate site, someone trustworthy?    there's a howto at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/NetworkConsole but I'm not comfortable preparing that ISO or USB drive.
[19:53] <Sheikhmak> ikonia, it is, i've mounted the drive, but I want to make sure, I write it right in fstab
[19:53] <ikonia> just treat it like a normal entry file system nfs, and the source device is host:device
[19:54] <Sheikhmak> yup that seem to work ikonia
[19:56] <DWSR> can I force a reinstall of a metapackage and ALL it's depends?
[19:57] <root________> DWSR: I've had that question a dozen times.
[19:59] <CQN> if i'm doing an full system rsync backup, should i backup the ~/.cache directory?

[20:10] <drecute> I will like to know, how do I make sure a host and guest vm have different ip addresses and are accessible from any external host, just like a physical box?
[20:11] <drecute> So far, I've done bridged networking but when I try to ssh from the host to the bridged interface ip address, I land on the host machine but not the guest vm
[20:11] <drecute> since i'm doing bridged networking, what IP address is the guest meant to have so it can be accessible just like a physical host
[20:12] <cheesecakes> umm i was running an uodate from 12.04 to 12.10 and its been running for more than an hour now
[20:12] <cheesecakes> how much longer will it take ?
[20:13] <drecute> everytime I ssh to the bridged interface ip, I land on the host
[20:13] <root________> drecute: okay, so you assign an IP address to the bridge device br0 for your local host, then the guest should have an IP address in the same subnet that's not used by another host.  Say you're using the 192.168.100.xx addresses, and your router is .1, your host is .2, and your desktops are above .100.  You might pick .3 for your VM, or anything else that's unused.
[20:13] <cheesecakes> anyone else updated ... can someone some time estimates ?
[20:13] <cheesecakes> s/some/give
[20:14] <drecute> root________: you mean i can go ahead and assign a static ip to the guest vm?
[20:14] <Pymous> I try to edit my rc.local, do I need some specifiq syntax ? Or I just copy/paste my command ? (like => mount /this/here /to/this/here)
[20:15] <Noskcaj> i cant replicate it :(
[20:15] <root________> drecute: if you would like to, yes.  Assign it to the eth0 device inside the VM though, not the vmnet0 device that is visible from the host.  You can also use DHCP to auto configure the guest if you prefer.
[20:15] <guntbert> drecute: do you have a DHCP sevrer in your network? Then let it assign an IP address to the guest
[20:17] <drecute> root________: thank you. It worked
[20:19] <fugitivecoast> Hi, I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out how to gain access to super user.  I am admin and the only account but when I type su and put in my password it tells me that the authentication failed.  I am trying to install a NVIDIA video driver.
[20:20] <memomemo> hi! how can i make my memo file atomatically open when i log in? for example in gedit.
[20:20] <drecute> guntbert: if a service is not running on a port, can that port be opened via iptables?
[20:21] <drecute> guntbert: I mean just some random port number I want to open up
[20:21] <cheesecakes> fugitivecoast: try using sudo -i
[20:21] <root________> drecute: you can "open" it in iptables, but with nothing listening there, it doesn't have any effect.
[20:21] <guntbert> drecute: a port is only regarded as "open" if some server is listening there
[20:21] <Cavisty> http://www.ustream.tv/channel/live-dnb-j-anderson
[20:22] <escott> memomemo, add it to gnome-session-properties
[20:22] <fugitivecoast> Cheesecakes: thank you I will give this a try
[20:22] <drecute> i can make a service listen there right?
[20:22] <drecute> like ssh ?
[20:23] <memomemo> escott: oh, ok, and the command is just "gedit /file/path/momo.txt ?
[20:23] <escott> memomemo, sure
[20:24] <guntbert> drecute: please start by telling us your goal
[20:24] <escott> memomemo, there are also various yellow stick pad type applications
[20:24] <root________> drecute: sure.  You can pretty much make any service listen anywhere you want.
[20:24] <drecute> guntbert: sorry. I just wanted to do something simple
[20:25] <fugitivecoast> I am root but now while trying to run the .run file I get this message:    ERROR: You appear to be running an X server; please exit X before
[20:25] <fugitivecoast>          installing.  For further details, please see the section INSTALLING

[20:25] <FloodBot1> fugitivecoast: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[20:25] <drecute> guntbert: I just want to make ssh listen on a different port so I can forward port a request to it on that non-standard port
[20:25] <memomemo> escott: thanks =) i tough it would be much harder, thanks! i don't like those yellow things, i have a small screen but thanks i'll see in the next start up if it works, thanks!

[20:26] <cheesecakes> fugitivecoast: then run sudo lightdm stop
[20:26] <guntbert> drecute: in that case tell ssh to listen on another port (in /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
[20:26] <cheesecakes> fugitivecoast: and then install your driver
[20:26] <guntbert> drecute: by default there is no firewall active
[20:27] <cheesecakes> fugitivecoast: once your driver installation is done, so a sudo lightdm start to get back the gui

[20:27] <ubottu> drecute: Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in.

[20:52] <TheLordOfTime> edoceo_, 12.10 (Quantal) is the latest release, but the latest LTS is 12.04.

[20:52] <TheLordOfTime> depending on what you're looking ;)
[20:52] <wouitmil> Hi every body !
[20:52] <TheLordOfTime> looking for *
[20:52] <edoceo_> quantal!  Ok, rhm,,, so `do-release-upgrade` is confused then, not pam_motd...
[20:53] <jackarg> soulz: yes?
[20:53] <guntbert> edoceo_: on server you probably only want LTS releases
[20:53] <schultza> i think i screwed up my installation. my date/time in the upper right has disappeared.. what are the packages i need to install to get it back?
[20:53] <edoceo_> `do-release-upgrade -c` doesn't even show 12.10;
[20:54] <k1l> edoceo_: can you put a "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" into a pastebin?
[20:54] <edoceo_> apt-get update has nothing do do, I've done that only a few minutes ago
[20:55] <edoceo_> dist-upgrade only show: linux-image-3.2.0-34-generic
[20:56] <edoceo_> If I do `do-release-upgrade -d` then it allow 12.10;
[20:57] <ikonia> no
[20:57] <ikonia> -d = development
[20:57] <ikonia> 12.10 is not development

[20:59] <ikonia> cardpuncher: right click the drive on the desktop and click unmount
[20:59] <ikonia> cardpuncher: (or do it in nautilus)
[20:59] <edoceo_> ikonia: well, motd says I need to upgrade, and `do-release-upgrade` says I'm on the latest version.  I'm on Precice and Quantal is the latest
[20:59] <cardpuncher> the option is grayed out apparently, the question is from bangarang
[20:59] <edoceo_> One of those two things is not working properly
[20:59] <k1l> edoceo_: what is your release-prompt?
[21:00] <bangarang> ikonia: only the unallocated is able to do parttition
[21:00] <bangarang> http://i.imgur.com/XjmZ3.png
[21:00] <ikonia> are you sure you set it to upgrade to non-lts ?
[21:00] <edoceo_> New release '12.10' available.  \n  Run 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.
[21:01] <k1l> edoceo_: and is this a server? or a pc? if a server: are that hoster-specific sources or theoriginal ubuntu. etc. etc.etc.
[21:01] <ikonia> bangarang: you're trying to restart a 1mb partition, there is no space
[21:01] <edoceo_> do-release-upgrade: No new release found

[21:01] <edoceo_> orignal ubuntu
[21:01] <bangarang> how can i check
[21:01] <bangarang> not sure
[21:01] <k1l> if you refuse to give information im not motivated to help you. :/

[21:02] <ikonia> it's later than the original ubuntu 12.10 version
[21:02] <k1l> edoceo_: oa, its a vps. so talk to your hoster for that problem
[21:02] <ikonia> that's not an ubuntu install
[21:02] <fugitivecoast> How do I disable the Noveau graphics driver?
[21:03] <ikonia> that's some bastardised thing

[21:03] <ikonia> edoceo_: no
[21:03] <ikonia> edoceo_: it's a vps,
[21:03] <edoceo_> dang
[21:03] <bangarang> ikonia:  the option is gray on the 450gb disk
[21:04] <ikonia> the option in the gry is 1.2MB as it says
[21:04] <ikonia> bangarang: you have an lvm physical volume assigned that is 465GB
[21:04] <ikonia> (the brown thing)
[21:04] <wN> lvm++
[21:04] <ikonia> that PV is inside an extended partition (the light blue thing)
[21:04] <bangarang> so what do I need to do? change to what
[21:05] <ikonia> bangarang: what do you want to change ?
[21:05] <edoceo_> So, perhaps I file bug with Linode that their mods make some inconsistencies show up up between motd & d-r-u
[21:05] <ikonia> no
[21:05] <bangarang> anything that allows me to make a new partition...
[21:06] <ikonia> it's a bastardised version
[21:06] <ikonia> bangarang: you need to remove the PV then create partition out of that
[21:06] <ikonia> bangarang: do you have any logical volumes assigned to that PV
[21:06] <edoceo_> bastards!
[21:06] <edoceo_> thanks!
[21:06] <ikonia> edoceo_: no need for that
[21:07] <k1l> edoceo_: a vps install is no real install. the guest (your vserver) shares alot with the host. so they have special installations. talk to you hoster for that
[21:08] <edoceo_> Hmm, in my shop my Gentoo bare metal running Ubuntu under KVM seems to be not so bastardized
[21:08] <bangarang> ikonia:  how do I remove the PV? and PV means...
[21:08] <edoceo_> I suppose, we build differently than Linode
[21:08] <ikonia> edoceo_: why would it be bastardised....unless you've done it
[21:08] <ikonia> edoceo_: what ?
[21:09] <ikonia> edoceo_: you've just a default install, linode use a custom distribution, why are you comparing the two things
[21:09] <edoceo_> Cause I'm as dumb as you think I am; thanks for making me feel welcome
[21:10] <bangarang> hello? ikonia
[21:10] <ikonia> bangarang: yes ?
[21:10] <guntbert> bangarang: you cannto remove a PV- its the base of LVM - and be patient please
[21:10] <guntbert> *cannot
[21:11] <qubit> guntbert: you can, as long as there's nothing on it
[21:12] <guntbert> qubit: correct :-) but I doubt that this is the case here
[21:12] <bangarang> so.. how do I make a partition out of this?
[21:12] <bangarang> http://i.imgur.com/44Rqd.png
[21:13] <ikonia> bangarang: you need to remove the PV

[21:13] <bangarang> fellow helpers are saying its not possible to remove it.. and how do I do that?
[21:14] <ikonia> bangarang: probably because you have logical volumes in i

[21:17] <bangarang> what if i change it to prep

[21:21] <bangarang> what are the implications? i just want to create a NFST
[21:21] <bangarang> NFTS partition
[21:21] <jure_> cant run compiz... help
[21:21] <sevenforall> Does anyone happen to know a tool that downloads subtitles for TV series and merges them with the file, all automatically?
[21:21] <ikonia> bangarang: the implications are any data on that partition/volumes under it will go
[21:22] <bangarang> damn...
[21:22] <jure_> any1?
[21:23] <bangarang> so there is no can Do.. ikonia
[21:23] <ikonia> bangarang: I've just told you the options
[21:25] <hysp> hola, soy nuevo. tengo dos preguntas, supongo que las podre hacer aquí... es posible hacer un acceso directo a una aplicacion que corre bajo wine, para que nada mas darle click se abra con wine y todo eso?
[21:26] <bradlee> Any experts in kernel buffer allocation here?
[21:26] <bekks> !es | hysp
[21:26] <Pici> !es | hysp
[21:26] <ubottu> hysp: En la mayoría de los canales de Ubuntu, se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español entre al canal #ubuntu-es; escriba "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y presione intro.
[21:26] <bangarang> ikonia: is it possible to play highend res games on virtualbox?
[21:26] <bekks> bangarang: Why?
[21:26] <ikonia> bangarang: not really
[21:26] <bangarang> bekks:  why? what?
[21:27] <ikonia> bangarang: but that's just my opinion - I don't think virtual machines should be used for that sort of thing
[21:27] <ikonia> especially on home hardware
[21:27] <bekks> bangarang: Sorry :) It was ment for bradlee

[21:53] <Frogzilla> Quick question, I have PPTPD VPN setup on my 12.04 Server, how can I monitor data being transfered?
[21:54] <Ogredude> Frogzilla: I don't know how to monitor it, but I do know that you'll only ever be able to tell how much data is going through that tunnel, not what the data is.
[21:54] <Frogzilla> Ogredude: So I won't be able to see what people are doing? How do I know if people are using the VPN to do illegal things?
[21:55] <Ogredude> Frogzilla: you can't.
[21:55] <Ogredude> a VPN tunnel is encrypted, unless you've got a supercomputer handy to do your decryption, there is no man-in-the-middle attack on a VPN
[21:55] <Frogzilla> Ogredude: So somebody could download 1 terabyte of pirated things, and I would have no idea? Ever?
[21:56] <Frogzilla> Ogredude: I host the VPN so even from server-side I can't see?
[21:56] <Ogredude> Frogzilla: you'd know they transferred a terrabyte of stuff, but you'd never be able to tell *what* stuff
[21:56] <Ogredude> the whole point of VPN is that it's a virtual *private* network
[21:56] <qubit> Frogzilla: yes, if you are the vpn endpoint, you can see what comes out of the vpn
[21:56] <Frogzilla> qubit: Any idea how?
[21:57] <qubit> Frogzilla: depends how you want to monitor, you can use something like `ntop` to get general info, or tcpdump to see data
[21:57] <RomulusDaniel> hello
[21:58] <Frogzilla> qubit: More like something to notice how much data is flowing, and if I see a huge spike, like a 4 gig file downloaded, I'd like to see where the data was transfered from, e.g. piratebay or isohunt
[21:58] <Ogredude> good old man-at-the-endpoint attack, eh?

[22:08] <ekhaat> RomulusDaniel: so you have ubuntu 12.10 installed?

[22:17] <salihk87> Hello guys, i have a serious problem but i don't know how to solve it. When i click shutdown ubuntu stucks. I am using 12.04 LTS
[22:18] <Pici> Nightwatch: don't use a * at the end. the space in your filename is confusing du
[22:19] <kloqq> is there anyway i can reinstall Ubuntu on a notebook from another cpu?
[22:19] <Nightwatch> Pici - now it just hangs
[22:19] <zykotick9> Pici: personally i use "du -sh *" on a regular basis...
[22:20] <Nightwatch> and du -sh * works on all other cases
[22:20] <zykotick9> kloqq: perhaps reask your question without using the work "cpu" (as that doesn't make any sense)
[22:21] <Nightwatch> ok, same result Pici - invalid argument
[22:21] <etfb> Is there a way to stop that overlaid command-line thing appearing whenever I press Alt?
[22:22] <kloqq> zykotick9:what do you mean? I meant can I re-install ubuntu on the notebook via another computer?
[22:22] <zykotick9> kloqq: sorry that was suppose to be word, not work...
[22:22] <ekhaat> Nightwatch: well, what is the argument? or rather the whole commandline you are typing
[22:22] <Pici> Nightwatch: hm... I've seen similar errors with unescaped spaces...
[22:22] <zykotick9> kloqq: not that i'm aware of, unless you take the HD out of one, and put it in the other
[22:22] <Nightwatch> ekhaat - I pasted
[22:22] <Nightwatch> nothing else
[22:22] <Nightwatch> think I have a file system issue
[22:23] <zykotick9> Nightwatch: can you just ignore the error?  "du -sh * 2>/dev/null" ?
[22:23] <ekhaat> Nightwatch: ok, sorry
[22:23] <kloqq> zykotick9:damn, because I can access the notebook via grub or whatever its called, but I have no idea how I'm to send over files etc to another computer
[22:24] <zykotick9> kloqq: network boot/installs are possible, but not something i've done before
[22:24] <kloqq> zykotick9:ah okay, if I'd download an installation unto a usb-stick?
[22:25] <zykotick9> kloqq: usb boot/install should be straight forward
[22:26] <kloqq> zykotick9:but then I'll loose all files I've got on it right? the notebook also has dual partitition with windows XP on it, but that only gives a blue screen

I normally recommend open source drivers, but in this case it's worth trying the STA driver.

[23:44] <mopeyennui> Hello. I have a problem with lubuntu. I need to kill a virtual monitor.. I only use one desktop.
[23:44] <dr_willis> I think however the default UBUNTU installer does do pae. Lubuntu and xubuntu does not.
[23:44] <mrojas6996> anyone know how to uninstall at least what the install of a. tar.bz2 installed?
[23:44] <RomulusDaniel> ok
[23:44] <dr_willis> mrojas6996:  it could be most anything, to anywhere. totally depends on what was in it.
[23:44] <RomulusDaniel> but i have low ram
[23:44] <RomulusDaniel> what should i install?
[23:45] <mrojas6996> is there any way to generate a script that uses the contents of that package to install or remove content that I install? as do. deb

[23:48] <mrojas6996> i can't open Alsamixer

[23:48] <mrojas6996> the privative driver has broken my ALSA
[23:48] <Jordan_U> RomulusDaniel: I believe that the Lubuntu installer uses a non-pae kernel by default. Have you tried that?

[23:52] <mrojas6996> I have sound in my PC, ALSA is broken, when I try to execute the command: alsamixer, it shows: can not open mixer: No such file or directory
[23:53] <mrojas6996> alsa is broken because I installed a driver that only supports the 3.0 kernel and 2.6 kernel
[23:53] <mrojas6996> and i have the 3.5 kernel
[23:54] <Jordan_U> mrojas6996: If you boot an Ubuntu 12.10 LiveCD/USB does sound work?
[23:54] <mrojas6996> when i follow the guides that says "How to reinstall ALSA" or something, install all the packages but no sound
[23:55] <mrojas6996> Yes, when I boot from my LiveUSB the sound work
[23:55] <daftykins> you need to reinstall the packages and force config defaults to return, not just check they're installed
[23:56] <Jordan_U> mrojas6996: What guides did you follow?
[23:56] <mrojas6996> even, the sound worked before of I install the privative driver

[01:28] <Tex_Nick> marianne : right ... if that doesn't help ask agani in here ... you'll probly find a better solution from someone else ... good luck
[01:28] <intelikey> sara you can try to execute it.   sh /path/to/filename.txt
[01:28] <tomreyn> Sara: either the filename extension is incorrect or, more likely, it's actually not an installer but a text file which explains how the installation process works.
[01:29] <escott> deper29, i guess check the permission on the server for those folders
[01:29] <zykotick9> deper29: if you are using NFS, perhaps only /mnt/user/Books is exported?
[01:29] <Sara> the file is on desktop so it is sh /Desktop?
[01:29] <deper29> zykotick9: if I pastebin my /etc/exports would that help?
[01:30] <Sara> hmm ok thanks :)
[01:30] <intelikey> sara i would look inside first to see if tomreyn's post applies.  and without the leading slash   Desktop/filename......
[01:30] <zykotick9> deper29: can you see what's exported?  is it /mnt/user or something else?
[01:30] <gharz> guys, i miss ubuntu. just so happened that my laptop has pre installed win8... anyone successfully installed ubuntu alongside with win8? please help. thanks!
[01:31] <deper29> zykotick9: if I ssh in, there is stuff in /mnt/user on the server
[01:31] <puppy_parade> tomreyn, " freetype spu text error: Breaking unbreakable line" is all that appears, and that is only for VLC
[01:31] <tomreyn> Sara: you can also install the 'file' package and run the 'file' command it provides on the file in question, this will give you a mostly reliable idea of what type of file it is.
[01:31] <zykotick9> deper29: stuff yes, but what's in /etc/exports?
[01:32] <gharz> anyone?

[01:34] <tomreyn> intelikey: i think it still ignores extensions and interprets magic bytes exlusively. but have not studied its source code.
[01:34] <zykotick9> deper29: ya, just exporting /mnt/user instead of individual directories would be a LOT easier...

[01:35] <jrib> Gwennifer: what are you doing exactly that requires you to do that so often?
[01:35] <deper29> zykotick9: the server is actually running unRAID, and so every time I make something in the web interface that is under /mnt/user it makes a new entry automatically

[01:40] <puppy_parade> It's maddenning.
[01:41] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: you can also try upgrading / downgrading drivers, and to try the open source ones (which can be a good option either in general or just to ensure it's indeed the driver that's at fault, not your hardware)
[01:42] <puppy_parade> I upgraded to 12.10 for the oss drivers

[01:45] <puppy_parade> I have a 7000 series card
[01:46] <puppy_parade> support for them is still very rough
=== msdaisy is now known as ms-daisy
[01:50] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: then you may want a newer kernel, too
[01:50] <kelvinella> very annoying, how come ubuntu wont do anything about it
=== _JKL1234-_ is now known as NetSplitLover
[01:51] <kelvinella> is there a way to disable screensaver while playing flash movie?
[01:51] <puppy_parade> This card has been out nearly a year
[01:52] <puppy_parade> I upraded to 12.10 for the newer kernel version, and it was still inadequate
[01:52] <puppy_parade> I've done post release kernels before, and it's a pain
[01:54] <jsbach> Are there any active mirrors for Ubuntu < 8.x?
[01:55] <zykotick9> !eol | jsbach
[01:55] <Flannel> jsbach: You realise those are all EOL and not supported (and many have major security holes) right?
[01:55] <jrib> jsbach: all those versions are EOL and no longer supported.  Why not use a current, supported version?

[01:55] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: have you tried searching the web for an answer providing your very model name and a concise description of the major issue? i find this offten helps.
[01:55] <jsbach> Flannel: Thanks for your input.
[01:55] <jsbach> jrib: I have reasons.
[01:55] <jsbach> ms-daisy: Thank you.
[01:56] <Flannel> jsbach: old-releases will work fine.  It has mirrors and isos.  You just need to be aware of that fact first.
[01:56] <jsbach> Flannel: Thanks again.
[01:56] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: and so can reporting bugs, since chances are soemeone else reported it before, your bug report will be tagged a duplicate of that, and the other bug report has a workaround or fix in it.. that's part of why i suggested you file a bug.
[01:56] <Ben64> jsbach: it also does not contain all the security fixes and could leave you vulnerable
[01:56] <Tex_Nick> kelvinella : if you're using VLC there is an option to disable screensaver during playback
[01:56] <Flannel> Ben64: He's aware, four times now.
[01:57] <ms-daisy> The old releases are great for practicing attacks if that's what he's doing Flannel jsbach

[01:57] <kelvinella> Tex_Nick, in ff or chrome
[01:57] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: ati, i would guess
[01:58] <kelvinella> Tex_Nick, and the option doesnt work in xubuntu
[01:58] <Flannel> ms-daisy: Sure, but it's irresponsible to just hand it out without ensuring they're aware theyre getting unsupported (and potentially dangerous) software.
[01:58] <raub> s/being run/running/
[01:58] <Tex_Nick> kelvinella : sorry i thought you were playing flv files
[01:58] <kelvinella> in xubuntu the screensaver just come on no matter what except i have to move the mouse once a while

[02:15] <tomreyn> in the philosophical or the carnivore sense?
[02:16] <blackshirt> is apparmor just for confine aplication ?
[02:16] <nibbler_> i have a hosted server, i installed 12.4 lts, the hoster (hetzner) has fast mirrors, but it seems he does not offer a Contents-amd64.gz or such, anyway apt-file update gives me: Ignoring source without Contents File:  http://mirror.hetzner.de/ubuntu/packages/dists/precise-backports/Contents-amd64.gz - any hint?
[02:16] <She153> does anyone know how to remove ubuntu ?
[02:16] <nibbler_> She153: just install whatever else you like
[02:17] <ms-daisy> remove it from what She153 ?
[02:17] <nibbler_> ...just don't want to switch everything to a new mirror.... makes sense to use the local one.

[02:22] <tomreyn> nibbler_: just tell them their mirror of this repository is incomplete

[02:23] <tomreyn> nibbler_: here's another mirror which shows this file should be there: http://mirrors.mit.edu/ubuntu/dists/precise-backports/
[02:23] <nibbler_> She153: answering the questions people ask you might be a good first step
[02:23] <nibbler_> tomreyn: thanks

[02:25] <She153> and that dont work nibbler
[02:25] <ms-daisy> wut? She153 you want to remove ubuntu from backtrack???
[02:25] <She153> backtrack is a distro of ubuntu
[02:26] <Sara> any idea how i can solve the error for http://www.mediafire.com/view/?12cycq00dflhc4c (vmware 7 on ubuntu 12.04)
[02:26] <Frankko> tomreyn: i asked so i will not bother ubuntu developers and users, and it is a complete hassle to make run on anything other than ubuntu. Someone might be helpful
[02:26] <She153> i want to put windows back on my pc
[02:26] <ms-daisy> Yes She153 , correct. So how could you possibly remove the os that backtrack is built upon?
[02:26] <Frankko> She153: noone is stopping you
[02:26] <ms-daisy> so you want to remove backtrack and replace it with windows She153 ?
[02:26] <She153> yes
[02:26] <Tex_Nick> marianne : out of curiosity try hitting the escape key ... does that help
[02:27] <She153> why do i keep getting smart ass answers ?

[02:27] <ubottu> Frankko, please see my private message
[02:27] <ms-daisy> She153, it's not smart-ass at all. The way you remove it is entirely dependent on how it was installed.
[02:27] <tomreyn> Frankko: and i apologize.
[02:27] <She153> i meant that for franko
[02:28] <ms-daisy> You can put windows on the machine by using the windows install CDs. That will completely remove everything currently on the computer and replace it with a new windows installation She153
[02:28] <She153> ok maybe i need to talk to someone who knows what backtrack is
[02:28] <marianne> Tex_Nick: let me try
[02:28] <She153> no it wont
[02:28] <ms-daisy> I know what backtrack is.
[02:28] <bazhang_> She153, its NOT supported here
[02:28] <bazhang_> She153, go to the backtrack channel for support.
[02:28] <Tex_Nick> marianne : You may have activated some accessibility options with a key-combination
[02:28] <bazhang_> #backtrack-linux She153
[02:28] <ms-daisy> to remove backtrack bazhang_ ?
[02:28] <She153> i have a windows live cd , and have changed the bios
[02:29] <She153> to boot from cd
[02:29] <ms-daisy> Perfect, you're on your way She153
[02:29] <nibbler_> She153: stop trolling
[02:29] <bazhang_> She153, how does this relate to ubuntu support.  ##windows for windows install help
[02:29] <She153> it keeps going back to backtrack
[02:30] <marianne> Tex_Nick: seems ok for now... I'll keep an eye on it... next problem is the title bar on the windows doesn't have the exit resize or expand buttons
[02:30] <bazhang_> She153, again, not an ubuntu issue.
[02:30] <ms-daisy> figure out what the bios setting is to boot from the CD. If it's not working then you don't have a bootable CD She153

[02:37] <marianne> Tex_Nick: yes, looking now
[02:37] <Sara> tomreyn   doesn't say anything about uninstall process
[02:38] <Tex_Nick> that will reset unity to default settings
[02:39] <tomreyn> stiltzkin: first of all, install all available system updates. you are behind, and chances are this issue was since fixed.
[02:39] <robertzaccour> hey yall
[02:39] <tomreyn> stiltzkin: oh and what bazhang asked
=== chiluk_away is now known as chiluk
[02:40] <stiltzkin> No, I am not running Mint. And I am fully up to date, except this is not the latest version of Ubuntu - I attempted to upgrade and it failed
[02:40] <robertzaccour> I was thinkin about somethin recently
[02:40] <intelikey> howto "minimize" a window in full screen mode ?
[02:40] <stiltzkin> All individual packages are updated however.
[02:40] <robertzaccour> Never could figure out why its so much harder to forgive myself than it is someone else.
[02:40] <tomreyn> stiltzkin: how did it fail? this would be something you should look into first of all.
[02:41] <IdleOne> robertzaccour: How is this ubuntu support related?
[02:42] <stiltzkin> If I remember correctly the updater itself crashed. It threw a lot of messages about conflicting packages (I apologize for not having specifics here, this was about a month ago) and having no way to recover the installation, I shut down the system. Now I'm just looking to see whether there's any way to get the GUI back or whether I just need to bite the bullet and reinstall.
[02:42] <bazhang> stiltzkin, is that elementary OS?
[02:43] <marianne_> Tex_Nick: can you resend the link please, my bird hit the power button and rebooted me
[02:43] <stiltzkin> bazhang, what are you talking about
[02:43] <bazhang> stiltzkin, the luna kernel
[02:43] <stiltzkin> no, luna is my hostname
[02:43] <tomreyn> luna would be the hostname, right
[02:44] <tomreyn> it's not like it's part of the kernel version
[02:44] <Tex_Nick> marianne : lol what happened to the bird ?
[02:44] <stiltzkin> I would not be asking a question here unless it was ubuntu related.
[02:44] <Tex_Nick> marianne_ : http://askubuntu.com/questions/134172/window-title-bars-missing-occasionally-in-unity
[02:45] <marianne_> Tex_Nick: nothing... he's just being a tool... I took the tv remote away cuz he was eating the buttons
[02:46] <tomreyn> stiltzkin: getting package conflicts fixed and installing the remaining updates can be a requirement to get your system back into a working state. you can use the "apt-get" command line utility to do it.
[02:46] <tomreyn> !apt-get > stiltzkin
[02:46] <ubottu> stiltzkin, please see my private message
[02:47] <stiltzkin> ...why are you telling me how to use apt-get?
[02:47] <tomreyn> stiltzkin: because i think you want to fix your package managemnet system and that you would probably have done so by now if you knew how to.
[02:48] <stiltzkin> There is no problem with my packages though...
[02:48] <stiltzkin> this is a driver proble
[02:48] <tomreyn> stiltzkin: for a matter of fact, your kernel version is a couple patch levels behind, so at least you don't have the latest patches. which could be a cause of the issues you're running into.
[02:49] <stiltzkin> Well yeah, it is...because as I said, the upgrade was not successful
[02:49] <stiltzkin> I mean this is not a critical issue or anything, I can always reinstall. I'm really more just curious as to what happened and if it's easier to fix than to reinstall
[02:50] <GMDynamics> Hello!
[02:50] <Tex_Nick> marianne_ : the only thing in the link i provided of importance is ... in terminal type unity --reset ... this will reset unity to default settings ... the link tells warns you that preferences will be reset also

[02:55] <stiltzkin> Yeah, the driver itself is segfaulting. I think it's reinstall time unfortunately.
[02:55] <GMDynamics> @Hajime i was that sarcasm ? :D
[02:55] <ms-daisy> GMDynamics, you can replace it with dpkg.
[02:56] <marianne_> Tex_Nick: thank you again...
[02:56] <zykotick9> GMDynamics: i assume you want apt back?  do you know if anything else was removed with it?  download the DEB for apt and use dpkg to install it... hopefully that works.
[02:56] <DaemonicApathy> GMDynamics, did you want to know how to reinstall apt?
[02:56] <GMDynamics> dpkg is failing for some weird reason
