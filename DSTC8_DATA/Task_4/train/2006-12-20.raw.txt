[04:19] <arrenlex> cymuHep: You were answered.
[04:19] <noelferreira> did you see the pastebin arrenlex? it was working fine. but now i installed new ati drivers and a got that error
[04:19] <arrenlex> noelferreira: Why did you do this if it was working fine? =P
[04:19] <cld2> I need help with /etc/init.d/bluetooth I cant seem to get hidd started. if I do hidd --server hidd -search from the cli it works but wont hold that config after a reboot. ideas?
[04:19] <LineOf7s> cld2:  If there's an OSS alternative that works just as well (or near-as-dammit), I'll go with that and be happy about it.  If not, I'll use whatever I need to in order to get the functionality I'm used to and/or need.  I might personally love .oggs with a passion, but no-one else I know has heard of them.  mp3 is a necessary evil (in a very loose usage of the term 'necessary').
[04:19] <arrenlex> jeffm515: Does this work? http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger/menu.html?f=test.mpg
[04:20] <noelferreira> because there where new drivers. so i thought it were better
[04:20] <lupine_85> .mp3 is patented, but that doesn't make it evil :p

[04:33] <arrenlex> cld2: Yes, I remember !fglrx-ing him earlier as well.
[04:33] <the_rick> The only solution I have found is to give the root user a password and I'm trying to buy into this whole sudo thing
[04:33] <jeffm515> arrenlex:  okay, so mplayer ls /usr/lib/win32/ | wc -l  -?
[04:33] <arrenlex> seamus7: uninstall -386. -generic is newer.
[04:33] <arrenlex> jeffm515: No.
[04:33] <cld2> arrenlex: I need some hand holding for the gui ish things like bluetooth and such but I at least try to read what im being told. ;)
[04:33] <arrenlex> jeffm515: Use the mplayer command on your .wmv file. i.e. "mplayer <file.wmv>". Pastebin all output.
[04:33] <seamus7> arrenlex: ok thx ... so i should then install the generic version of the linux-restricted-modules?
[04:34] <cld2> seamus7: there is really no need to uninstall old kernels. you can only use one at a time.

[04:50] <maebmij> Hi, I'm getting a problem where my root partition occasionally gets remounted as read-only. When I try to put it back, I'm told it's "write-protected". Is there a way to tell the OS that it isn't in fact writeprotected? Or is that something the hardware is enforcing for some reason? (this is on vmware)

[04:51] <thedoors> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=luxi+sans&btnG=Google+Search
[04:51] <arrenlex> maebmij: root partition has the switch "on errors, remount read-only". If it is remounting read-only, I assume it is because you are getting errors.
[04:51] <newbuntu> no matter what .sh file i try to install

[04:56] <zspada15_> arrenlex: what is a segmentation fault?
[04:56] <arrenlex> bruenig: It's fantastic when you don't want anything to work!
[04:56] <newbuntu> now im worried
[04:56] <AfterDeath> a segmentation fault is when a program has a major error
[04:56] <arrenlex> zspada15_: It's when you try to access memory in an illegal manner.
[04:56] <mebaran151> a segfault is a program error
[04:56] <AfterDeath> such that the OS kills it
[04:56] <lupine_85> zspada15_: where memory tries to access a memory segment it shouldn't
[04:56] <newbuntu> .sh files used to be easy to install wah wah
[04:56] <zspada15_> newbuntu: is this a new machine?
[04:56] <lupine_85> a stupid coder, essentially
[04:56] <javiolo> some help with NFS this is my /etc/exports   -> /home/javier/shared 192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0(rw,async,insecure,all_squash,anonuid =1000,anongid=1000)    I get syntax error
[04:56] <newbuntu> newish install
[04:56] <mebaran151> do we still use memory management with segments?
[04:56] <arrenlex> zspada15_: For example: int i; i = "Hello"; <--- segfault
[04:56] <mebaran151> I thought that was an antiquated idea
[04:56] <lupine_85> mebaran151: virtual segments
[04:56] <arrenlex> zspada15_: Another way to cause it is to try to write to read-only memory.
[04:56] <zspada15_> neil_edgy: the hardware?
[04:56] <mebaran151> ah
[04:56] <newbuntu> yes 1 to 2 year old machine
[04:56] <zspada15_> arrenlex: like kernel memory?
[04:56] <lupine_85> each program has a "segment" of memory it can access
[04:57] <arrenlex> mebaran151: It's old terminology that has stuck around despite not applying anymore.
[04:57] <lupine_85> but the kernel doesn't have to load pages, etc

[05:03] <bruenig> levander, it is best that you install it separately. When I did use it, I installed it separately. There are just too many permission issues because azureus likes to write and add stuff to its installed directory instead of putting it all in a home configuration directory. I found that to be a  big issue

[05:07] <bruenig> levander, not that hard to set up. Well not for me, I am pretty used to it by now having installed it on 3-4 different installs

[05:07] <bsamson_> I'm a kde dork bso maybe i'm biased toward ktorrest but its the closest to azuereus in functionality that ive seen thats not terribly slow
[05:07] <LineOf7s> EdLin:  Verizon - the "can't differentiate between cents and dollars" company.  :o)
[05:07] <arrenlex> linuxeatswindows: Not gui. I want you to run the command line version. "mplayer <file>"

[05:08] <newbuntu> I think the best thing if you want to play windblows games is to have a dual boot and thats just what im going to do
[05:09] <linuxeatswindows> it works from commandline, but not from gui

[05:09] <linuxeatswindows> arrenlex, it works from command line but not from gui
[05:09] <newbuntu> edlin yah but thats what im trying unsucesfully install and it cost money anyways
[05:09] <arrenlex> linuxeatswindows: Then go to the GUI and change the settings to reflect what you saw it use in the command line.

[06:10] <llindy> crashed
[06:10] <Akuma_> i downloaded some security updates yesterday night, and now gnome wont boot anymore. did anybody hear about problems with the latest updates?
[06:10] <hlds> yea i know how but i had windows vista.
[06:10] <Tonren> n2diy, when you go into hibernate, it writes memory into the swap partition.  right?  Then, when you boot up, it reads from the swap partition.
[06:10] <hlds> and den installed Xp on another HD
[06:10] <llindy> ah, uh hu

[06:11] <BrianSteffens> jerimiah40 no you can use either 32 bit or 64 bit versions. 32 bit will not use all of your processing power but 64 bit is less compatible with different softwares
[06:12] <Jerimiah40> Music_Shuffle - is it like Windows in that the x64 version has almost zero compatability?

[06:13] <BrianSteffens> jerimiah40 if you have a 32 bit version of windows dual-booting with ubuntu, i would go with the 64 bit version of ubuntu and use windows as your 'compatibility os'

[06:13] <hlds> ill format again i guess.

[06:13] <hlds> for ubuntu just use Vmware dont dualboot.

[06:14] <Jerimiah40> Now, this leads to the next question, how much of a pain in the ass is it to dual boot?  From what I've read it's rather difficult
[06:14] <hlds> its easy.
[06:14] <lupine_85> Jerimiah40: verr easy
[06:14] <Jerimiah40> okay
[06:14] <hlds> install ubuntu first den xp and there u go.

[06:14] <lupine_85> XP is not linux-aware. Linux is windows-aware.
