[11:59] <amitprakash> MonkeyDust, right.. so how do I change whats there.. to something that works with udev
[12:02] <MonkeyDust> amitprakash  havent needed or tried it mayself

[12:05] <jrib> koskoz: I'm not saying it's wrong of you to ask here.  I'm saying, #vbox is more likely to know

[12:10] <rnk_> does anyone know where xrandr gets its default maximum resolution from?
[12:10] <Sh0rtWave> So I'm trying to run update manager
[12:10] <Sh0rtWave> and I'm getting this "Requires installation of untrusted pacikages" dialog
[12:11] <Sh0rtWave> that doesn't give me the option to say "Shut up, just install untrusted stuff"
[12:11] <Sh0rtWave> Instead it just has CLOSE
[12:11] <Sh0rtWave> How unuseful is that?
[12:11] <Sh0rtWave> Anyone got any ideas on how to work around that?
[12:12] <ariana> Sh0rtWave, U should switch off untrusted channels in settings
[12:12] <chris______> run 'sudo apt-get update | grep NO_PUBKEY'
[12:12] <Sh0rtWave> ariana: Considering that I NEED the packages in the untrusted channels, that's not really a useful option for me.
[12:13] <Sh0rtWave> Is there no setting here I can use to override that lunacy?
[12:13] <chris______> then do sudo apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com {the number after nopubkey}
[12:13] <chris______> Sh0rtWave, run 'sudo apt-get update | grep NO_PUBKEY' and tell be the output

[12:13] <Sh0rtWave> arrrgh
[12:14] <Sh0rtWave> That would be a fail.
[12:14] <chris______> Sh0rtWave, we are going to make it trusted
[12:15] <Sh0rtWave> I know, I know...it's just irritating that I have to ALWAYS drop into a terminal to do anything remotely serious in Ubuntu

[12:16] <Sh0rtWave> I've been using Linux for 20 years.
[12:16] <Sh0rtWave> but the intended use for this machine...is for someone who's not like me.
[12:16] <MonkeyDust> Sh0rtWave  the you should be familiar with the terminal
[12:16] <Sh0rtWave> I think you're completely missing the point.
[12:16] <Sh0rtWave> I don't want to have to support this machine once it's built.

[12:19] <GearSecondo> chris______: I did. After that I have a Directory...and now?
[12:19] <chris______> GearSecondo, open up a terminal cd to the directory that the folder is in. Do you know how to do this?
[12:19] <GearSecondo> I read I have to run ./configure, in that folder now, but like I said I get an error
[12:20] <Sh0rtWave> what's the error?

[12:20] <chris______> whats the error
[12:20] <GearSecondo> no such file or directory
[12:20] <Sh0rtWave> Are you actually in that folder?

[13:46] <clark> Problem #1: my audio sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. can someone give me a hand at trouble shooting this problem? I'm not sure on all my hardware and software, and do not know how to determine what i have.
[13:46] <Sh0rtWave> lspci would be the first step
[13:46] <Sh0rtWave> having a look at dmesg output would be another step
[13:46] <Sh0rtWave> like
[13:46] <Sh0rtWave> Say you've got USb devices, you could do
[13:47] <Sh0rtWave> dmesg | grep usb to see what's there
[13:47] <Sh0rtWave> lspci will enumerate PCI devices
[13:47] <clark> alright, i pulled up both of those commands
=== scp1 is now known as fortplanteringst
[13:48] <Sh0rtWave> lspci should give a fairly comprehensive list of what's in the machine.
[13:48] <Dr_willis_> canon has very poor linux support with a lot of their hardware
[13:52] <clark> i think the problem is somewhere between my tv/monitor and my graphics card (vizio and radeon hd 6450) because sometimes I'll have something playing on my computer and switch over to a different input on my tv; but when i switch back to my computer, i have no sound (sometimes i still will have sound)
[13:52] <clark> Pulse audio will still show that something is playing, but i won't get any sonud
[13:52] <clark> sound*
[13:55] <clark> any thoughts? or is this definately not an ubuntu problem?
[13:57] <Sh0rtWave> clark: Smells like your TV, actually. I find that with my television, if the FIOS channel changes from 480 to 720, then sometimes the sound won't catch up correctly and I have to switch inputs to component back to HDMI before it starts working.
[13:58] <Sh0rtWave> clark: I really doubt that an audio stream on a PC, once working, will magically stop because you changed an input.
[13:58] <clark> I'll surely buy that, because i was thinking the same thing

[15:26] <MCl0vin> i7c, not sure what is that ?
[15:26] <Eagleman> solved
[15:26] <i7c> MCl0vin: pulseaudio is a "sound server". it is like a virtual audio device which manages the sound output for all applications.
[15:27] <zykotick9> Eagleman: use useradd (NOT adduser) without the -m
[15:27] <MCl0vin> i7c, how do i check if i am using it please
[15:27] <i7c> MCl0vin: which player are you using? can you check in the settings what audio device is used?
[15:27] <ChesterX> hey guys, how can i add an .iso as a source to the ubuntu software center?

[15:27] <MCl0vin> mplayer i7c
[15:28] <i7c> mhm ok. i think mplayer uses pulseaudio by default, but not sure. you can install pavucontrol.  open a terminal and type   sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
[15:29] <i7c> MCl0vin: mhm or wait a second.
[15:30] <MCl0vin> i7c, pavucontrol is already the newest version.
[15:30] <i7c> MCl0vin: i think pavucontrol won't help. go to terminal and type alsamixer
[15:30] <MCl0vin> i7c, but shouldn;t it detect when i plug my earpeice
[15:30] <kinglet> any idea?
[15:31] <i7c> MCl0vin: with F6 you can choose your sound card and you can turn off speakers.
[15:31] <i7c> MCl0vin: yes it should, i dont know why it does not work, sorry.

[15:42] <MobileXMan> my mouse doesn't always work in ubuntu 11.10 for some reason
[15:42] <scottamunga> Hi everyone.  I had a question about Precise.  I'm using the 64-bit edition, and when I log in to Unity 3d, I have graphical glitches.
[15:43] <MobileXMan> i have an alienware m17x R3 laptop, and my touchpad doens't always work right
[15:43] <scottamunga> I upgraded from Oneiric.  I had used Ubuntu Tweak to make certain features transparent (such as window titlebars) that aren't officially supported (I guess?) I was wondering if that could've caused this, and if I need to do a fresh install of Precise.
[15:43] <MCl0vin> When I connecting my headphones to laptop, the speakers is still working. Where is the problem?
[15:43] <b17ChX> lol
[15:43] <scottamunga> MC10vin, what version? At least for me, that issue stopped on my Compaq presario cq60 after Maverick.
[15:44] <MCl0vin> scottamunga, 12.04
[15:44] <scottamunga> Mc10vin, oh sorry
[15:44] <MCl0vin> scottamunga, HP dv7
[15:45] <OY1R> 361635
[15:45] <scottamunga> Mc10vin, I haven't read through this, but I did a quick google search for "HP dv7 headphone jack sense Ubuntu" and this bug report on Launchpad came up: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/433683
[15:45] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 433683 in linux (Ubuntu) "HP Pavilion dv7 2108 doesn't mute speakers & switch output to headphones when they are plugged in" [Wishlist,Fix released]
[15:48] <scottamunga> although, it seems to be from 2009.  I wonder why in the world it's still affecting you. :(
[15:48] <scottamunga> Just wondering if anyone had any idea about my issue.
[15:48] <scottamunga> I upgraded from Oneiric.  I had used Ubuntu Tweak to make certain features transparent (such as window titlebars) that aren't officially supported (I guess?) I was wondering if that could've caused this, and if I need to do a fresh install of Precise.
[15:49] <scottamunga> There are graphical glitches when booting into Unity 3d (but not Unity 2d)
[15:49] <scottamunga> MCl0vin, if I find anything I'll let you know
[15:50] <scottamunga> also, random question, but does anybody use Jupiter in Precise?  Notice any power savings?
[15:52] <MobileXMan> Hi everyone. I have issue with power adapter in ubuntu 11.10, on alienware m17xR3 laptop. when it is plugged in when the OS loads to the desktop, there is no issue. However, after the OS has loaded, if I unplug the adapter and then replug it in, the power icon on the desktop stills shows it on battery power and the battery discharging, and I cannot get it to see the power adapter plugged in.
[15:52] <User_007> Hello guys, i got some problems with my wireless card, and i need to change it from n to g mode in order to get it working with my router. How can i do that?
[15:53] <scottamunga> MobileXMan, does the battery still drain, or charge? Maybe as a workaround, you could set the battery indicator to only show up when charging/discharging?
[15:54] <scottamunga> I've noticed graphical glitches when logging into Unity 3d.  I upgraded from Oneiric.  I had used Ubuntu Tweak to make certain features transparent (such as window titlebars) that aren't officially supported (I guess?) I was wondering if that could've caused this, and if I need to do a fresh install of Precise.
[15:54] <MobileXMan> scottamunga, i am not sure if the battery actually discharges or not when the adapter is plugged in, but ubuntu thinks it is discharging, so when it reaches a point to where its close to being drained (in Ubuntu's mind), it will try to hibernate.
[15:54] <htorque> hi everyone! what's a good way to use a web proxy in ubuntu that requires authentication? i don't really like to add the user/pass in plain text to 'System Settings <unconvertable> Network <unconvertable> Network proxy'.
[15:54] <scottamunga> The Ubuntu Tweak settings are no longer there
[15:55] <ASMODEUS_> What's a good and easy to configure HTTP proxy?

[15:56] <scottamunga> MobileXMan, I'm by no means an expert, but let me search for your problem and see what comes up
[15:56] <ASMODEUS_> Thanks
[15:56] <scottamunga> what's the computer model again?
[15:56] <MobileXMan> scottamung, its an alienware m17xR3 laptop
[15:56] <scottamunga> alright, brb
[15:57] <piremerd> test. hello
[15:57] <LoRez> is there a way to get ubuntu 11.10/12.04 to not capture Alt-~?
[15:58] <b17ChX> I'm having sound problems with Rakarrack.
[15:59] <scottamunga> MobileXMan, here's something about the m17xR2 laptop.  It mentioned problems with the BIOS.  Have you upgraded your BIOS?
[15:59] <scottamunga> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1506490
[16:00] <ASMODEUS_> Anybody ever install Ubuntu on a Dell Precision M4300?
[16:00] <MobileXMan> scottamunga. No, I have not upgraded my BIOS since I bought it. i have the A09 BIOS version.
[16:00] <scottamunga> oh ok, so this is info isn't even relevant
[16:00] <scottamunga> It did mention something about disabling Hybrid
[16:00] <obakfahad> Hello  guys !!!
[16:00] <scottamunga> Idk what this, because I've never owned an Alienware computer
[16:01] <scottamunga> does that have to do with power management in the gfx card?
[16:01] <obakfahad> Long live 12.04
[16:01] <scottamunga> hi obakfahad
[16:01]  * MCl0vin hates 12.04
[16:01] <pats_Toms> Hi, Is there someone who can help me to get libncursesw.so.5?
[16:01] <obakfahad> Hello scottamunga
[16:01] <scottamunga> hey MCl0vin, also, did you have problems with ubuntu on your laptop before 12.04?
[16:01] <obakfahad> What are you using scottamunga ?
[16:02] <scottamunga> I've had graphical issues myself (obviously)
[16:02] <scottamunga> obakfahad, I'm using 12.04 on a compaq presario cq60
[16:02] <david> I agree 12.04 is my favourite ubuntu version so far
[16:02] <obakfahad> I am in 12.04 32 bit...in acer aspire 4738z . scottamunga
[16:02] <scottamunga> agreed david.  I feel it's much more polished, although I wish I had fewer problems with it
[16:03] <ASMODEUS_> Does anyone use Unity?
[16:03] <obakfahad> Very very good release
[16:03] <MCl0vin> scottamunga, don't recall if i did or no with this specific issue!! but since i have installed 12.04 it is giving me hell every f**king time
[16:03] <scottamunga> ASMODEUS_, I do.  I used to hate it (I liked gnome 2 with docky.) but I've grown accustomed to it.
[16:04] <scottamunga> I also am having issues running certain windows software for my work and a steam game, so I still have to use windows a bit.
[16:04] <MonkeyDust> MCl0vin  mind your language and don't use ubuntu if you don't like it
[16:04] <MCl0vin> 12.04 is like 2014 Lexus with a 79 honda engine to me
[16:04] <ASMODEUS_> Same but now since I started using it, I tend to drag my cursor into the top left corner of my screen when I use Windows.
[16:05] <scottamunga> I've noticed graphical glitches when logging into Unity 3d.  I upgraded from Oneiric.  I had used Ubuntu Tweak to make certain features transparent (such as window titlebars) that aren't officially supported (I guess?) I was wondering if that could've caused this, and if I need to do a fresh install of Precise.
[16:05] <MobileXMan> scottamung, idk, but i'm using the 2GB GDDR5 NVIDIA <unconvertable> GeForce <unconvertable> GTX 675M card
[16:05] <ASMODEUS_> Does anybody get garbled text with libcairo2 and Nouveau (nvidia drivers)?
[16:05] <MCl0vin> MonkeyDust, or else what?
[16:05] <scottamunga> do you know if you're using the latest nvidia drivers (under Additional Drivers)
[16:06] <cyf3r> Hi! I've got a question... This morning ubuntu says my screen is a screen of a laptop. And I only can select resolutions for a laptop screen... and there isn't an option to say it isn't a laptop screen
[16:07] <MobileXMan> yes, i have installed the nvdia additional drivers which fixed an issue having to use the "nomodeset" option in the grub entry when booting ubuntu
[16:07] <daze> cyf3r: my PC screen also thinks it's a laptop :)
[16:07] <scottamunga> ok.  As I said, I'm by no means an expert, just trying to go through everything I can think of.
[16:07] <losthorizons> hi guys - I have a question.  I was going to install Ubuntu via the wubi installer.  I was wondering, how can I choose to boot either between Ubuntu or Windows once I have everything installed?
[16:07] <daze> but I don't really see a problem with that
[16:08] <cyf3r> its a problem cause I can't select the correct resolution
[16:08] <scottamunga> but it sounds like you've done everything you can at this point.  I'd just keep searching the web for answers, and also, hopefully someone will come in who knows a bit about this.
[16:09] <scottamunga> 1 more thing MobileXMan: have you tried askubuntu.com?  I think the devs answer questions there.
[16:09] <cyf3r> nvmd... It's fixed now :/
[16:09] <daze> cyf3r: strange. I suppose there's a config file you can add your preferred resolution to. aren't you using a lcd?
[16:09] <MCl0vin> another question i have, how can i make konsole my default terminal in 12.04
[16:10] <MobileXMan> scottamunga, not yet. i will try that next.
[16:10] <MobileXMan> and then also the ubuntu forums
[16:10] <cyf3r> daze: It works fine now.... its just that sometimes ubuntu switches the resolution when I restart my pc
[16:10] <MobileXMan> but thanks for the help.
[16:11] <MCl0vin> how can i make konsole my default terminal in 12.04 please
[16:11] <scottamunga> MobileXMan, sorry I couldn't help more.  I know it's frustrating when you have an issue and can't find a solution.
[16:11] <cyf3r> has anybody compiled the LibSS7 library with cgg? I keep getting tons of error messages while compiling it :s
[16:11] <MCl0vin> i turn to like it better than the default
[16:13] <losthorizons> hi guys - I have a question.  I was going to install Ubuntu via the wubi installer.  I was wondering, how can I choose to boot either between Ubuntu or Windows once I have everything installed?

[16:18] <Sontogo> Hi, I'm a linux newbie, installing ubuntu for the first time, and I'm some problems
[16:19] <cromag> sharky1: a question - otherwise no one answers :D
[16:19] <cromag> Sontogo*
[16:19] <cromag> baah..
[16:19] <Sontogo> At first I was getting a black screen after selecting 'install', so I did some web research, and found some people needed to select 'nomodeset' to make it work. I tried that and the installation worked
[16:19] <wilee-nilee> Sontogo, give us a outline.
[16:19] <Sontogo> after the installation, the system said I needed to reboot, so I did, but again I got the black screen
[16:19] <Sontogo> I read on the web that I need to make the 'nomodeset' permanent so that upon boot, it works, but I don't know how to do that
[16:20] <bgamari> For those of you in console-based IRC clients, does anyone see this character () rendered with single-cell width?
[16:20] <bgamari> For me it is rendered in two cells
[16:20] <odinsbane> 3 cells for me
[16:20] <wilee-nilee> !nomodeset | Sontogo you need to enter it again in the kernel, update when you are in and check additional drivers
[16:20] <ubottu> Sontogo you need to enter it again in the kernel, update when you are in and check additional drivers: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[16:20] <bgamari> odinsbane: Strange
[16:20] <bgamari> This appears to happen in both xterm and gnome-terminal
[16:20] <MonkeyDust> bgamari  irssi here, 2 cells
[16:21] <odinsbane> bgamari: plus there are two parenthesis around the characters.
[16:21] <bgamari> I really don't know where in the stack this is; I don't think xterm depends on pango
[16:21] <Sontogo> this is a stupid question, but how do I access the kernel?
[16:21] <bgamari> odinsbane: Yes, that was typed
[16:21] <bgamari> Sontogo: What do you mean?
[16:21] <wilee-nilee> Sontogo, check the link full instructions there.
[16:21] <MonkeyDust> Sontogo  if you don't know how, you shouldnt
[16:22] <odinsbane> MonkeyDust: then he cannot boot.
[16:22] <wilee-nilee> Sontogo, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132
[16:22] <Sontogo> I read that, it says "To set kernel boot options, you must edit your grub configuration. You can do this temporarily for a single boot by entering the grub menu. If you do not get to see the grub boot menu after the bios automatically, you may have to press SHIFT key after the bios logo to get in to grub:"
[16:22] <wilee-nilee> Sontogo, correct
[16:23] <Sontogo> I tried getting into the grub menu, but wasn't able to. I'm not sure what the grub menu is
[16:23] <odinsbane> Sontogo: it is the boot menu when you load up it gives you a choice of OS's to use.
[16:23] <MonkeyDust> Sontogo  the grub menu is where you can choose ubuntu or windows (mostly)
[16:23] <Sontogo> I don't get menu what I boot up
[16:23] <Sontogo> I only have ubuntu on the machine
[16:24] <Sontogo> *I don't get that menu..
[16:24] <odinsbane> Sontogo: did you press shift right after the bios stuff.
[16:24] <Sontogo> yea tried that
[16:24] <Sontogo> will try again thogh
[16:24] <wilee-nilee> Sontogo, tap the shift at powering on hit e fro edit at the menu
[16:24] <wilee-nilee> tap repeatedly or hold down as soon as you power on. Sontogo
[16:24] <Sontogo> ok I will restart the machine now and try that
[16:25] <Sontogo> I'm running ubuntu off of the USB right now
[16:25] <wilee-nilee> Sontogo, is this 12.04
[16:25] <Sontogo> yes
[16:25] <wilee-nilee> Sontogo, cool it is shift then
[16:25] <Sontogo> actually let me go on my laptop so I can continue this chat while it's booting up
[16:25] <wilee-nilee> sure
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[16:28] <Sontogo_> when I press shift upon booting up, it takes me to a screen with a purple background, and language options
[16:28] <Sontogo_> is that the Grub menu?
[16:28] <tuxgeek> no
[16:29] <Sontogo_> I have five menu options: 'Try Ubuntu without installing', 'Install Ubuntu', 'Check disc for defects', 'Test memory', and 'Boot from first hard disk'

[16:36] <odinsbane> Can I format a usb drive to ext2 and boot from that?
[16:36] <Somelauw> Also the tabs in firefox are displayed in huge letters.
[16:37] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, boot what?
[16:37] <odinsbane> wilee-nilee: ubuntu
[16:37] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, not unless it is a full install
[16:38] <bobo123> i try to connect my laptop directly to the WAN port but somehow i can't get an IP address from the router, how can i solve this problem? i tried this on windows i somehow get an IP address from the router
[16:39] <bobo123> the DHCP server on the router is started
[16:39] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, you trying to set up ubuntu to be seen by windows?
[16:40] <Somelauw> Sorry, but upgrading to ubuntu 11.10 is the worst thing I ever did. Nothing works anymore.
[16:40] <odinsbane> wilee-nilee, no I am trying to setup a usb disk so I can use ubuntu at work.
[16:40] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, you can't boot a fat there?
[16:40] <smerz> bobo123, ubuntu behaves like windows in this regard. you connect the cable, and then it will try to get an IP via dhcp
[16:41] <odinsbane> wilee-nilee: fat is fine.
[16:41] <odinsbane> wilee-nilee: There are some issues about sim links when using fat.
[16:41] <bobo123> smerz: i tried that but i don't get an IP address from the router, and in windows my laptop gets an IP address, that's the problem
[16:41] <smerz> bobo123, are you sure the network port you're using will receive a dhcp response. and did you configure eth0 (lan) to use dhcp (or perhaps a static config)
[16:41] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, when you say ubuntu disc you mean a full install, or a live cd disc
[16:41] <smerz> bobo123, it's not configure to use some sort of static configuration?
[16:42] <bobo123> smerz from the NetworkManager it is per default Automatic DHCP
[16:42] <smerz> yup
[16:42] <dethos> Hello, how can i install the package oxygen-gtk in my ubuntu? i can't find it in official repos
[16:42] <odinsbane> wilee-nilee: I want something that has additional packages to the default install.
[16:42] <bobo123> smerz: in windows i see that the router has gave me an IP address
[16:42] <odinsbane> wilee-nilee: it will be a live usb but I need some added functionality.
[16:43] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, use a flash and persistent, just don't update it, and untick the cd in softwrae sources, run a update to get the repos synced but only install your pckgs
[16:43] <smerz> bobo123, can you run ifconfig. and private message me (or use nopaste) the data for eth0 ?
[16:44] <Somelauw> Is there a way to recover ubuntu as much as possible if a dist upgrade made the system unresponsive?
[16:44] <nagarjuna> hi all,  is there any GUI tool for sharing others desktop like team viewer in windows
[16:44] <odinsbane> wilee-nilee: what do you mean use a flash?
[16:44] <neglesaks> ubuntu one notes sync is still down.
[16:44] <smerz> bobo123, this is the ifconfig data, that my wireless has right now (for example) http://nopaste.info/f858e0d19c.html
[16:44] <odinsbane> wilee-nilee: do you mean flashdrive?
[16:44] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, don't install the updates, just run it to get the repos synced for your installs, after unticking the cd
[16:44] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, yes a flash drive.
[16:45] <bobo123> smerz, just a sec
[16:45] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, you know what a persistent is?
[16:45] <ska> odinsbane: no its a desktop system.
[16:45] <odinsbane> wilee-nilee: I am not clear on what a persistent is.
[16:46] <nagarjuna>  is there any GUI tool for sharing others desktop like team viewer in windows
[16:46] <david> Hi all. I've set up Ubuntu Server 12.04 and am attempting to configure network shares using Samba (currently testing over home network using Windows 7). I have a read-only share that is working fine, but when I attempt to write to the non-read-only share using the Windows client, I'm getting an access denied / you need permission error. Any advice? :)
[16:46] <odinsbane> I have an iso, I used Unetbootin to create a flash drive with 1gig persistent data. It ran out of room. I tried to use 4gigs persistent and unetbootin froze.
[16:46] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, usb installers like unetbootin and the installer in ubuntu have a persitent option so the usb flash has a memory of your installs,
[16:46] <wilee-nilee> persistent*
[16:47] <odinsbane> (the drive is is a 4gig memory stick)
[16:47] <thx1138> hello
[16:47] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, you probably want at the least a 4 gig usb
[16:47] <halfmt> I have a screen brightness issue, been crawling the forums and nothing's working! Its not a simple key/software issue but more likely driver/device problem.  I can catch you up on what all I've tried if anyone's interested/has any suggestions?
[16:47] <thx1138> could someone help me with a cryptography question?
[16:48] <wilee-nilee> odinsbane, a usb load has limited use as it is reading the ISO, so installing updates will fill it up and possibly installing a kernel update will break it.
[16:48] <bobo123> smerz: i can't copy the ifconfig result because i can't manage now to get internet on the laptop, but i don't have an "inet4 addr" line in the result, there is only "inet6 addr" in the result with an MAC address after it

[16:51] <Somelauw> Why is it that all text is displayed in a very huge caption when using a window manager other than unity?
[16:51] <smerz> bobo123, also maybe try "sudo dhclient -r"   (it's supposed to check for dhcp). it that doesn't work try "sudo /etc/init.d/network restart"
[16:51] <odinsbane> Okay so I have a 4gig memory stick, and unetbootin. I'm not sure how much persistent data I can allocate. When I said 4gigs it unetbootin froze.
[16:52] <Somelauw> Is there some way to fix it?
[16:52] <odinsbane> Somelauw: what wm?
[16:52] <smerz> bobo123, and you doo see your network interface in the ifconfig list right? i.e. the kernel did detect and install your network card right? ;-)
[16:52] <Somelauw> odinsbane: wmii
[16:53] <Somelauw> odinsbane: It never had that problem before. I suspect the login manager is messing with it temporarily.
[16:53] <odinsbane> Somelauw: what was the previous login manager?
[16:54] <Somelauw> odinsbane: Just gnome-login-manager and now the ubuntu 11.10-thing.

[16:55] <david> Hi all. I've set up Ubuntu Server 12.04 and am attempting to configure network shares using Samba (currently testing over home network using Windows 7). I have a read-only share that is working fine, but when I attempt to write to the non-read-only share using the Windows client, I'm getting an access denied / you need permission error. I *think* I've added the relevant options in Samba, but would appreciate assistance! :)

[16:59] <escott> !vnc | nagarjuna
[16:59] <ubottu> nagarjuna: VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[16:59] <sulaiman> nagarjuna, I use rdesktop sometimes to remotely access my windows machine on my network
[17:00] <nagarjuna> ok i will with those tools. thx guys :)
[17:00] <smerz> nagarjuna, for personal use i recommend nxserver & nxclient.  they're faster than the other tools i've seen. comes close to citrix in windows ;-)
[17:00] <Eagleman> I cant find this folder for openvpn: /usr/share/openvpn/plugin/lib/openvpn-auth-pam.so

[17:02] <odinsbane> who scored for england?
[17:02] <smerz> nagarjuna, ahh you want to connect to windows "remote desktop" ?
[17:02] <odinsbane> ... woops
[17:02] <smerz> nx client & nx server is to make a nice "linux remote desktop". disregard my comments then hehe
[17:02] <nagarjuna> smerz: yes i want to connect windows desktop using ubuntu
[17:02] <smerz> google linux RDP viewer
[17:02] <smerz> you
[17:03] <smerz> you'll find a client. i think there is one in ubuntu repository. easy to install
[17:03] <smerz> in fact it's already installed on mine
[17:03] <smerz> open dash board type "remote"
[17:03] <smerz> and you should have the remote desktop client in the list
[17:04] <gmachine_24> My wireless connection starts up and then after about 10 or 15 seconds it disconnects. Ubuntu 11.04 has been installed for whatever a year and I've never had problems before. Switched routers and it still happens. Other laptops it's not an issue. It's a BCM4312 wireless controller.
[17:04] <smerz> i got "remote desktop viewer" and "remina remote desktop client". can't tell you which one is better. but both of these appear to come with ubuntu ouf of the box ;-)
[17:04] <nagarjuna> smerz: i hav desktop sharing in my ubuntu
[17:05] <smerz> no client ?
[17:05] <smerz> then go into the ubuntu software manager and look for either of the 2 i named
[17:05] <nagarjuna> will it work for  windows. Ya there is remmina remote desktop clint is there
[17:05] <smerz> yes they will work. they're made to connect to windows "remote desktop" yes
[17:05] <BlackZatara> alg pode me ajudar
[17:06] <smerz> "remote desktop viewer" i'm sure it works

[17:13] <BlackZatara> um min
[17:13] <smerz> gmachine_24, which channel are you on, and which are your neighbours on?
[17:13] <smerz> because like channel 1,2,3 they all overlap. you really want to be 4-5 chans away from the mass. other than that I got no further ideas sorry :(

[18:47] <cypher-neo> Silivrenion, You upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04?
[18:47] <Silivrenion> Yes
[18:48] <deffrag> escott: No, I don't see USB hub in lshw
[18:48] <cypher-neo> Silivrenion, See if you can access the boot menu by holding down Shift while it boots.
[18:48] <Silivrenion> One sec
[18:49] <cypher-neo> Silivrenion, There should be additional options in there. And if you have left-over linux images that haven't been deleted you could try booting from an older one and see if it completes the boot.
[18:49] <Silivrenion> Im in grub
[18:50] <cypher-neo> Silivrenion, Otherwise just hold for now... I'm gonna look something up.
[18:50] <Silivrenion> Ok

[18:50] <ubottu> Eagleman: You can identify automatically by using your NickServ password as the server password in your IRC client. When identifying manually, do NOT send the command from a channel's tab, or a typo may give away your password. If that happened, type <unconvertable> /msg NickServ set password <new-password> <unconvertable> in the server tab as soon as possible.
[18:50] <cknox> Eagleman: /msg nickserv help

[18:51] <oCean> martinphone: a little sed and cut will filter the links from that content
[18:51] <cypher-neo> Silivrenion, Looks like it could be a graphics issue.
