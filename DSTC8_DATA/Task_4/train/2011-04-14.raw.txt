[23:09] <ActionParsnip> Proxypoke: use:   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates
[23:09] <pupy> yes it does, ah ok, let me find it
[23:09] <bonhoffer> is there a simple way to see if it is fat32 or osx-file system
[23:09] <ActionParsnip> Proxypoke: read the whole page
[23:09] <bonhoffer> my macbook wasn't picking it up
[23:09] <bonhoffer> it is mounted
[23:09] <ActionParsnip> pupy: ok then use network manager to connect to a network
[23:10] <Proxypoke> the first screenshots gave the impression of a gui guide
[23:10] <pupy> yes I got it, is that icon on the top bar, thanks
[23:10] <Proxypoke> my bad
[23:10] <ooxi> ActionParsnip, did compile the download, didn't work eigther :-(
[23:11] <ActionParsnip> Proxypoke: cli is much quicker rather than having to mess with software centre
[23:11] <Proxypoke> yeah
[23:11] <ActionParsnip> ooxi: dang, you can always use ndiswrapper + windows driver
[23:11] <ooxi> hmm
[23:11] <Proxypoke> besides that, it's kinda difficult to use USC or synaptic while stuck in CLI mode ;p
[23:11] <Paddy_NI> Hi people, I am trying to turn my netbook into a wireless access point and I have absolutely no idea what I am doing... can anyone help ?
[23:12] <ActionParsnip> !ics
[23:12] <ubottu> If you want to share the internet connection of your Ubuntu machine with other machines in the network see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetConnectionSharing - You may also use !firestarter: http://www.fs-security.com/docs/connection-sharing.php
[23:12] <kdub> nyan cat
[23:13] <ActionParsnip> Proxypoke: cli ftw :D
[23:13] <Paddy_NI> ActionParsnip: That is ICS it is not turning my laptop into a wireless access point :)
[23:13] <Paddy_NI> s/laptop/netbook
[23:14] <ActionParsnip> Paddy_NI: sure it is
[23:14] <Paddy_NI> hmm
[23:14] <Paddy_NI> ActionParsnip: Umm.. aint there steps to see if my netbook wifi can actually broadcast an AP
[23:14] <ActionParsnip> Paddy_NI: "Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) provides the ability for one computer to share its Internet connection with another computer. To do this, a computer with an Internet connection must be configured to function as an Internet gateway"
[23:14] <Paddy_NI> Yes
[23:15] <Paddy_NI> but that is not precisely the same thing
[23:15] <ActionParsnip> Paddy_NI: I COPIED that from the first link...
[23:15] <Paddy_NI> read that page already mate
[23:15] <Paddy_NI> one of the first things I did
[23:15] <ActionParsnip> Paddy_NI: it tells you how to setup the system essentially as a wireless router
[23:15] <Hoptimist> Paddy_NI, You just want you comp to act as a wireless router? or?
[23:16] <Paddy_NI> I want my laptop which is connected to the internet via usb dongle to share its internet with my phone or whatever
[23:16] <Paddy_NI> Will my card even be able to do that
[23:16] <Paddy_NI> like reverse tethering
[23:16] <linuxthefish> Can someone tell me how to quit a frozen application on ubuntu server?
[23:17] <linuxthefish> anyone?
[23:17] <zcat[1]> trying to forward a port using iptables, but the server it's forwarded to sees the connection as coming from the firewall not the outside 'real' ip.. what am I doing wrong?
[23:17] <linuxthefish> fuck you!!
[23:17] <ActionParsnip> linuxthefish: ps -ef  | grep something    then run:   sudo kill -9 PID
[23:18] <jmwpc> if he had only waited
[23:18] <MK`> Is there a chatroom for X windows in general on this network I can be pointed to?
[23:18] <ActionParsnip> jmwpc: the smartest nes have the most patience
[23:18] <ActionParsnip> Paddy_NI: ah so the phone gets the web via your system
[23:18] <pupy> sorry guys, one more thing, I want to install moodle, so I do sudo apt-get install moodle
[23:18] <Hoptimist> Paddy_NI, I'm not sure about using the wireless card, but if you have bluetooth connection then its doable
[23:18] <Paddy_NI> ActionParsnip: Yep :)
[23:19] <Paddy_NI> Hoptimist: My phone has wifi my laptop has wifi
=== secoif_ is now known as secoif
[23:19] <Paddy_NI> basically the phone should connect to a wifi network.. correct
[23:19] <pupy> but i says it can't find the package, again, some app to use? or do I have to populate apt.list (or something like that) and run apt-get update?
[23:19] <Paddy_NI> also my mate is bringing his mac over to do some work
[23:20] <william__> can anyone help me with split command .. split -l 10 file.txt newfile  : puts splits into named file but with no extension.. I would like the file extensions to be .txt ???
[23:20] <kdub> william__: just rename it to have .txt at the end. linux doesnt treat file extensions any differently
[23:20] <jmwpc> ActionParsnip: I'm a noob still, but I have learned so much just leaving this channel open during the work day. It's a great resource... if you can be a little patient that is :)
[23:20] <ActionParsnip> Paddy_NI: so your phone and your friends mac want to use the laptop as a wireless ateway to the web
[23:20] <Paddy_NI> ActionParsnip: Yeah
[23:21] <ActionParsnip> Paddy_NI: then thats EXACTLY what the iCS page details
[23:21] <Paddy_NI> lol
[23:21] <sysop3> hi if I plug the same firewire drive into two ubuntu machines at the same time will both computer be able to access the drive??
[23:21] <william__> kdub i did that but then the extension was file.atxt file.btxt etc
[23:21] <Paddy_NI> ActionParsnip: I am an idiot
[23:21] <ActionParsnip> Paddy_NI: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router
[23:22] <Catarthes> hey people! hope I can share with you a software I'm doing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9IOxd3H4AM
[23:22] <Catarthes> it's no joke
[23:22] <Paddy_NI> ActionParsnip: Will it matter that I am using a usb dongle to access the internet?
[23:22] <Khisanth> software on youtube ...
[23:22] <kdub> william__: the file extension does not matter. the system knows its a text file regardless of what its named. just do 'mv file.atxt filea.txt
[23:22] <Paddy_NI> !ics > Paddy_NI
[23:22] <ubottu> Paddy_NI, please see my private message
[23:22] <ActionParsnip> Paddy_NI: it doesn't matter as long as there is an interface name you can do it
[23:22] <Catarthes> I began in windows and now made a ubuntu version, I'm looking for help with development
[23:22] <brightspark> How can I remove old keyboard layouts from the menu that shows up when I click my picture at the login screen?
[23:23] <P05TMAN> Can I upgrade to beta 2 form update manager?
[23:23] <Paddy_NI> ActionParsnip: yeah ppp0
[23:23] <Catarthes> yes Khisanth, software in youtube
[23:23] <Catarthes> the official page: www.simnation.info
[23:23] <ActionParsnip> Paddy_NI: then its fine you are good to go :)
[23:23] <Paddy_NI> ActionParsnip: :)
[23:24] <william__> kbud i need to do this with thousands of files what do you recomend so that the files are 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt and so on and not manual file naming ?
[23:24] <ActionParsnip> Catarthes: doesn't google eart do that stuff?
[23:25] <Catarthes> google earth show pictures, I show classes of vegetation
[23:25] <Catarthes> is more didatic
[23:25] <Catarthes> as for deforestation
[23:25] <maheanuu> I am trying to set up an external hd media player to format the drive and allow my  sis in law to store her videos on it, we deal in all the junk of the world here in the south pacific and have all the TV formats etc along with windoze and the other weird stuff
[23:25] <ubuntuguy> Why does the ubuntu battery icon ever show me how much battery my laptop has left, it just says estimating
[23:25] <ubuntuguy> Anyway to finx this?
[23:25] <MK`> Ubuntuguy: when it's plugged in or all the time?
[23:25] <ubuntuguy> All the time
[23:26] <MK`> Hm, I do not know, sorry. Mine does that when it is plugged in but when it is discharging it works properly
[23:26] <ubuntuguy> k
[23:27] <Khisanth> william__: the rename command can do mass renames :)
[23:27] <ActionParsnip> Catarthes: ahh i see
[23:27] <ActionParsnip> ubuntuguy: which release are you using?
[23:28] <kdub> william__: make new folder. run split within that folder. you'll get thousands of files. then you can do ' for i in `ls`; do mv ${i} ${i}.txt; done
[23:28] <ubuntuguy> 10.10
[23:28] <ActionParsnip> ubuntuguy: and what model and make system?
[23:28] <brightspark> Catarthes, the ibus one isn't in any of the menus
[23:28] <ubuntuguy> hp mini 110, 10.10
[23:28] <ubuntuguy> but it's also happening in 11.04
[23:29] <maheanuu> I cannot get it to change the partition or do a format, I have unmounted the drive, but it tells me that it is busy and is awaiting a job....
[23:29] <Catarthes> brightspark, you'll have to install it from Ubuntu Software Center
[23:30] <william__> ok .. thanks guys .. thanks a HEAP .. I got something to work with now.. where I was lost before.. thank you again for helping me as I did not know where to look
[23:30] <Catarthes> ActionParsnip what I'm trying to achieve is a economical-ecological simulator
[23:30] <ActionParsnip> ubuntuguy: are you currently running natty?
[23:31] <ubuntuguy> Yes I am
[23:31] <brightspark> oh I see it is called keyboard input methods
[23:31] <Catarthes> I think I'll have more control over it in c++ than if I build it above Google Earth
[23:31] <ActionParsnip> ubuntuguy: then your support is in #ubuntu+1
[23:31] <ubuntuguy> I'm also using 10.10 mind you
[23:31] <wavedigit> Catarthes, unix is built on C
[23:31] <ubuntuguy> I want help for 10.10
[23:31] <Catarthes> wavedigit, it would take longer for me to do my app in c, who knows someday?
[23:32] <ActionParsnip> ubuntuguy: I suggest you ask in the other chanel but aso try  the boot option: acpi=vendor     may help
[23:32] <faryshta> Thunar and nautilus doesn't load thumbnails on videos. What should I do?
[23:32] <ubuntuguy> k
[23:32] <Catarthes> but it's working faster than in windows, even with c++
[23:32] <maheanuu> Oh, I should have mentioned that I am running 10.10 and it was just upgraded 2 days ago
[23:32] <wavedigit> Catarthes, depends on the app, but if you are going to be OS (unix) specific... go with C
[23:32] <Catarthes> no, I want to distribute in linux, windows and mac
[23:32] <maheanuu> I do NOT have a machine that runs windows available so I cannot use the manual that came with this Media player
[23:33] <gnosis> Catarthes: what was your question?
[23:33] <ActionParsnip> Catarthes: make a project on launchpad and announce it on the forums and people may join
[23:33] <wavedigit> Catarthes, if portability is an issue, I would suggest Java
[23:33] <kdub> wavedigit: i'm a c fan too, but c and c++ are both pretty fast, and well supported in linux. i can code faster in C than c++,  but maybe Catarthes is faster with c++
[23:33] <Catarthes> actually I'm looking for help from concerned developers
[23:33] <Catarthes> launchpad? thanks ActionP
[23:33] <wavedigit> it alll depends
[23:33] <wavedigit> on where you want to go
[23:33] <wavedigit> and how
[23:34] <Catarthes> wavedigit, java is too heavy for 3d environments, I think (and the ammounts of data I'll load)
[23:34] <wavedigit> minecraft pulled it off though...
[23:34] <ActionParsnip> and runescape
[23:35] <Catarthes> they're equivalents of sourceforge?
[23:35] <d0lph1n> hi all, it's this server up?? irc.gimp.org
[23:35] <faryshta> Thunar and nautilus doesn't load thumbnails on videos. What should I do?
[23:35] <cfedde> d0lph1n: it seems to be.
[23:35] <ActionParsnip> d0lph1n: it pings dead slow, but does reply
[23:35] <Catarthes> is it an advantage to have the same project in two hosts?
[23:36] <cfedde> telnet irc.gimp.org 6666
[23:36] <s33kr1> exit
[23:37] <ActionParsnip> faryshta: try closing all nautiluses and run:  mv ~/.thumbnails ~/.thumbnails_old
[23:38] <d0lph1n> cfedde, ActionParsnip  can you join to irc?
[23:38] <ActionParsnip> faryshta: then rerun nautilus
[23:38] <d0lph1n> I cant
[23:38] <ActionParsnip> d0lph1n: didn't try
[23:38] <faryshta> ActionParsnip, SIR, YES SIR!
[23:38] <alosa> how can I close the 7175 port I don't have a postgresql...
[23:38] <gnosis> alosa: what's using it?
[23:39] <ActionParsnip> cfedde: irc uses port 6667 usually...
[23:39] <alosa> nessus
[23:39] <gnosis> alosa: try sudo /etc/init.d/nessusd stop
[23:40] <MaRk-I> d0lph1n: Connecting to irc.us.gimp.org (130.239.18.157) port 6667
[23:40] <MaRk-I> connected
[23:40] <d0lph1n> MaRk-I, thanks
[23:40] <MaRk-I> d0lph1n: yw
[23:40] <ActionParsnip> d0lph1n: yes, i'm on
[23:41] <maheanuu> Could someone point me to the Ubuntu  newbie channels here in freenode?
[23:41] <alosa> gnosi: sudo: /etc/init.d/nessusd: command not found
[23:41] <kdub> maheanuu: you've found it!@
[23:41] <alosa> I dont have nessus now
[23:41] <ActionParsnip> maheanuu: here is a good place, ask your questions and we'll try to help
[23:41] <faryshta> ActionParsnip, didn't worked :(
[23:42] <maheanuu> already did and no answer for the past 3 times I have been here
[23:42] <ActionParsnip> faryshta: do the images have thumbs though?
[23:42] <swatto> Anyone know of a remote control app for ubuntu
[23:42] <ActionParsnip> swatto: in what sense?
[23:42] <swatto> ActionParsnip: for android
[23:42] <faryshta> the images does, the videos doesn't.
[23:42] <swatto> ActionParsnip: so i can control my desktop from my phone
[23:42] <ActionParsnip> swatto: ok and what do you want to control?
[23:42] <gnosis> alosa: then how is nessus using that port?
[23:43] <faryshta> ActionParsnip, the images does, the videos doesn't.
[23:43] <rww> maheanuu: #ubuntu-beginners. There are fewer people there than here though, so good luck with that.
[23:43] <ActionParsnip> faryshta: ok then delete the backup folder we made, it'll save you space
[23:43] <maheanuu> I was working on a sound prob, and finally just went on my own for 2 days and repaired it, now am working on an external drive/media player for my sis in law who doesn't have a puter and the family only uses windoze..  I am not at the end of the world I am over it
[23:43] <faryshta> ActionParsnip, done.
[23:43] <ActionParsnip> swatto: there are apps which can control individual apps (transdroid can talk to transmission very nicely)
[23:44] <ActionParsnip> faryshta: let me hunt around
[23:44] <kdub> swatto's question is still vague
[23:44] <ActionParsnip> swatto: there are also vnc clients for android too
[23:44] <gnosis> maheanuu: what was your questions?
=== Craig_Dem_ is now known as Craig_Dem
[23:44] <Paddy_NI> gah
[23:44] <alosa> gnosis: I dont know
[23:44] <Paddy_NI> ActionParsnip: I am at a loss I did this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing?action=show&redirect=InternetConnectionSharing#Wireless Ad-Hoc connection sharing scenario and it does not show up to connect to on my phones wifi
[23:44] <Paddy_NI> ActionParsnip: I still don't think anything is broadcasting
[23:44] <ActionParsnip> faryshta: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=432529
[23:45] <maheanuu> At present I am trying to partition an old hd of mine to allow my sis in law to copy movies from the family and as I am not a doze pers, I have no access to anything other than Linux and am having probs
[23:45] <gnosis> alosa: how did you get that it was being used be nessus?
[23:45] <ActionParsnip> faryshta: seems you also need to run: sudo apt-get install libxine1-ffmpeg
[23:45] <swatto> ActionParsnip: Is VNC what Remote Desktop works off?
[23:45] <gnosis> maheanuu: what kind of probs?
[23:46] <ActionParsnip> swatto: yes, its really awkward on the screen, what apps do you want to run when you connect?
[23:46] <jojo_> Hello what would be the steps to identify what is causing my computer to freeze?
[23:46] <MK`> My laptop keyboard seems to lag when I press modifier keys like shift and ctrl. Is this usually a keyboard problem or a software problem?
[23:46] <swatto> just control the desktop  really
[23:46] <ActionParsnip> swatto: vlc can be controled amazingly if you enable the http interface in settings
[23:46] <jojo_> it seems that it happens randomly
[23:46] <maheanuu> gnosis, I have unmounted the external usb drive and now want to set it up as either a FAT drive or NTFS drive so that she can use it to store videos on from the family, I live on the outer islands in Tahiti and things are a liittle difficult here to say the least
[23:46] <alosa> I had a nessus installed from deb package but I removed by manager
[23:47] <ActionParsnip> swatto: if you are specific you will get better help, vnc is godawful on phones, its awkward and slow
[23:47] <faryshta> ActionParsnip, let me install it.
[23:47] <maheanuu> I keep getting an error msg that sez the drive is busy and awaiting a job????
[23:47] <ActionParsnip> faryshta: also check the nautilus setting mentioned
[23:47] <faryshta> ActionParsnip, "libxine1-ffmeg is already installed".
[23:47] <Localhost666> hi there
[23:47] <maheanuu> I cannot partition it or format it from this machine of mine, I am running 10.10
[23:47] <gnosis> maheanuu: what are you using to format it?
[23:48] <Localhost666> how can i solve the problem of flash?
[23:48] <ActionParsnip> maheanuu: if its mounted then you cannot manipulate it
[23:48] <ActionParsnip> Localhost666: what is the issues?
[23:48] <goose> Hi. Whenever I run ubuntu, either my CPU or GPU runs very hot, and it worries me.
[23:48] <maheanuu> I ave been trying to use disk manager, and it is unmounted
[23:48] <gnosis> alosa: sudo netstat -atp | grep 7175
[23:48] <Localhost666> it's just impossible to play youtube videos etc
[23:48] <ooxi> ok next problem: my graphic card only works in vesa mode. it's a firemv 2270. the binary driver tells me xorg not detected (ubuntu 10.10). and if i do sudo apt-get install ati (or radeon) it tells me package not found
[23:48] <gnosis> maheanuu: try gparted
[23:48] <ooxi> do i have to activate some special repository?
[23:49] <Localhost666> ActionParsnip...
[23:49] <ActionParsnip> Localhost666: ok can you use http://pastie.org to give the output of:  lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf
[23:49] <kdub> maheanuu: gparted is the easiest way to manage partitions
[23:49] <swatto> ActionParsnip: would be good to control VLC media player though, might try that
[23:49] <ActionParsnip> Localhost666: give me chance child
[23:49] <Localhost666> ok..
[23:49] <gnosis> alosa: that should show you what process is using port 7175
[23:50] <d0lph1n> MaRk-I, ActionParsnip is 130.239.18.157 (irc.us.gimp.org) only for US??
[23:50] <swatto> so if i enable it in VLC settings - for http interface i can just go to a web-browser and access it?
[23:50] <maheanuu> gnosis, I am going to have to learn gparted...  I saw it but have never used it...     I am not afraid to learn, as I am in my 70's and a ret. USN Chief and a Univac Field engineer, I do know enough to be damn dangerous <grin>
[23:50] <faryshta> ActionParsnip, tried everything on the forum except for installing totem. I will check if that works.
[23:50] <d0lph1n> mi Xchat client try to connect to 67.215.65.132
[23:50] <ActionParsnip> swatto: enable the http interface in prefs then install vlc remote beta by peter baldwin, works a treat here
[23:50] <MaRk-I> d0lph1n: no idea, in xchat i just typed /server irc.gimp.org
[23:50] <Localhost666> ActionParsnip: wait a sec
[23:50] <maheanuu> I will find a how to file on gparted
[23:50] <ActionParsnip> d0lph1n: same ip
[23:51] <Localhost666> i'm uploading the output :P
[23:51] <dziadu> hi

[23:51] <gnosis> maheanuu: gparted makes it all pretty easy.  and thank you for your service btw
[23:51] <faryshta> ActionParsnip, nop, nothing worked.
[23:51] <dziadu> why does natty install glibc and othere very important syslibs into /lib/i386-linux-gnu? is there some reason for this?
[23:52] <thewall> I know I'm missing something but how do I change the splash screen piccy?
[23:52] <gnosis> alosa: postgres is using that port then
[23:52] <bastidrazor> ooxi: normally, a special repository has a website that explains in detail how to use it
[23:52] <d0lph1n> omg, MaRk-I  this command connect :)
[23:52] <d0lph1n> thanks
[23:52] <Braber01> Hey I want to track Packets from a blogtv show, how do I use tcpdump for this?
[23:52] <ActionParsnip> Localhost666: you can run: sudo apt-get Instal pastebinit:    lsb_release -a > ~/t.txt; uname -a >> ~/t.txt; dpkg -l | grep flash  >> ~/t.txt; dpkg -l | grep gnash  >> ~/t.txt; dpkg -l | grep swf  >> ~/t.txt; pastebinit ~/t.txt; rm ~/txt
[23:52] <MK`> Ah, nvm, seems like hardware lag...
[23:53] <MaRk-I> d0lph1n: ;^)
[23:53] <maheanuu> Installing gparted now
[23:53] <zcat[1]> -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp -i ! -s 192.168.0.96 --dport 25 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.96:25   -- this is supposed to forward conenctions to our mail server but connections appear to originate from the machine doing the forwarding (inside the lan) not the external address... can anyone tell my how I have it wrong?
[23:53] <ActionParsnip> Localhost666: actually that is rubbish, don't bother
[23:53] <ooxi> bastidrazor, but the ubuntu wiki tells me to just do ,,apt-get install ati''
[23:53] <ooxi> but that package does not exist
[23:53] <ooxi> (and according to packages.ubuntu.com has never existed)
[23:54] <Localhost666> ActionParsnip: http://pastebin.com/pAjrAyea
[23:54] <faryshta> ActionParsnip, I had to "reboot" nautilus using "killall -9 nautilus" and thumbnails works now.
[23:54] <bastidrazor> ooxi: that would mean your 'special repository' was not added correctly.. since your initial statement was about adding a repositry

[23:55] <cp> I had a power failure and X/kdm isn't coming up.  I tried reinstalling the kernel, which rebuilt the nvidia module, but no help.  How can I invoke kdm startup to give me a better clue what package might be corrupted?
[23:55] <Localhost666> ActionParsnip: running..
[23:55] <Localhost666> do you want the output?
[23:56] <Localhost666> everything was successfully installed..
[23:56] <ActionParsnip> Localhost666: nar, just close all browsers then rerun to load the plugin
[23:56] <maheanuu> I did the apt-get install and it installed gparted now I am trying to find where it stay

[23:57] <Localhost666> or just execute the browsers?
[23:57] <bastidrazor> ooxi: are you using synaptic or apt-get?
[23:57] <ActionParsnip> close all browsers after the last command I ran finished, then rerun one
[23:57] <Localhost666> ActionParsnip: ok, ill do it
[23:58] <gnosis> maheanuu: systems>administration>
[23:58] <alosa> gnosis: what can I do more ?
[23:58] <Localhost666> ok.. i executed chromium again
[23:58] <ooxi> bastidrazor, apt-get. but i solved the problem: the packages is named xserver-xorg-video-ati not ati
[23:58] <Localhost666> it should work fine now?
[23:58] <ooxi> wiki is not accurate

[23:59] <bastidrazor> ooxi: good deal. correct package names is a must.
[23:59] <bcessa> hi there, hope someone can help me out with this, how can I obtain a SHA1 or MD5 checksum of a directory and/or of it's contents recursively ?
[23:59] <gnosis> alosa: do you have postgres running for a reason?
[23:59] <Braber01> !tcpdump
[00:00] <alosa> gnosis: no reason
[00:00] <gnosis> bcessa: i don't believe you can pass a directory to sha1sum
[00:00] <Localhost666> ActionParsnip: it seems to work fine :)
[00:00] <Localhost666> thanks dude :P
[00:00] <ActionParsnip> Localhost666: np man
[00:00] <gnosis> bcessa: you could make a tar and then then find its sha1
[00:01] <Braber01> um guys, can ANYBODY tell me how to run tcpdump on a blogtv chat room?
[00:02] <Jeruvy> Braber01: that doesn't make much sense, what are you trying to accomplish?
[00:02] <Braber01> I'm trying to track ip's of usernames in a chatroom on blogtv
[00:02] <swatto> where is the remote http in vlc please?
[00:03] <bcessa> gnosis: ok, thnx
[00:04] <swatto> How do you enable HTTP interface in VLC? cant seem to find it, downloaded the android app
[00:04] <Jeruvy> Braber01: tcpdump  will do that, but it won't provide a decent way to dissect what you want.  If you are familar with BPF's you could create one for your needs and use it with tcpdump.
[00:05] <Braber01> I'm not familar with either of those.

[00:14] <rww> (Debian)
[00:14] <phux> you guys suck :D
[00:15] <maheanuu> Thanx I just finished partitioning and formatting a 320 gig ext drive and now will try to see if I can install a couple of movies from my pute on it then send it to another neice and let her do a dump from her puter
[00:15] <gnosis> alosa: are you running metasploit?
[00:15] <fanta> nas
[00:15] <phux> rww, ohelig : so you mean "try to dig as deep as possible" is the correct answer?
[00:15] <CobZo> phux: if you don't mind something that's not linux: freebsd
[00:16] <gnosis> maheanuu: mind if I pm?
[00:16] <ohelig> random rant, I don't like using XChat to get on freenode, but apparently KVIrc is vulnerable to remote attacks and I need to update, but there are no updates available :|
[00:16] <maheanuu> Not at all
[00:16] <maheanuu> Please do
[00:16] <CobZo> phux: I'm currently using freebsd even on my desktop
[00:17] <alosa> gnosis: no, I'm shure
[00:17] <phux> CobZo: i dont mind, i want to learn about unix. but freebsd... didnt consider that. is there a special reason for mentioning that?
[00:17] <Khisanth> ohelig: not even as a source patch?
[00:17] <alosa> CobZo: how flash in fbsd ?
[00:17] <ohelig> I didn't check :s
[00:18] <kdub> phux: the best way to learn is to walk through a linux-from-scratch install, in my humble opinion
[00:18] <acicula> phux: lfs is a usefull way of learning how a linux os is fit together, but its not practical for an everyday os, just fire up some VMs and try a few distros
[00:19] <abstrakt> phux, kdub, LFS does nothing for newbs, far better to lean basic programming and stuff like bash (and programming bash) if you want to "learn linux"
[00:19] <CobZo> alosa: there is no native flash for freebsd but linux flash works fine with the linux emulation layer
[00:19] <abstrakt> learn C and bash
[00:19] <matsur> so im running an HTTP server on a high port number so I dont have to screw with drop privs etc, but want it listening on port 80. i have iptables setup to use nat/PREROUTING to forward reqs on 80 to 9999, and accept rules for 80 and 9999. how can i not expose 9999 to the outside world and just allow connections iptables is forwarding?
=== Lenin_Cat is now known as SirLenin
[00:19] <kdub> abstrakt: yeah, but it really helps to understand the linkers, kernel, all the stuff things run on. forces you out of the newbie sandbox
[00:20] <alosa> CobZo: fuck adobe
[00:20] <acicula> matsur: use the REDIRECT target and let the http server listen on the local loopback interface
[00:20] <gnosis> alosa: you definitely have metasploit installed.  just kill the postgres process
[00:20] <abstrakt> kdub, learning C forces you out of the newbie sandbox, what's your point?
[00:21] <CobZo> phux: if you want to learn unix then I really recommend you *BSD over linux. they are far more unix-like than any linux distro I've used
[00:21] <mister2> would it be a good idea to copy a home folder from 10.10 to a fresh installation of 10.10, or the 11.04 beta?
[00:21] <abstrakt> lol, who even still uses actual unix anymore?
[00:22] <acicula> mister2: there shouldnt be a problem with that
[00:22] <abstrakt> i mean, i'm sure there are some probably, but really?
[00:22] <c33dog> mac users do abstrakt =)
[00:22] <kdub> abstrakt: the point is its important to learn C, but its also important to learn the command line, autotools, revision control systems, etc if you're going to do any meaningful contributions
[00:22] <acicula> abstrakt: there are a few around still
[00:22] <ohelig> You would probably have a bunch of broken shortcuts, but there shouldn't be any major issues
[00:22] <phux> kdub: acicula: yes, im looking for an os keeping the balance between usability and learning
[00:22] <abstrakt> c33dog, um, not they use a bastardized version of BSD
[00:22] <abstrakt> hard to call that unix
[00:22] <Localhost666> Man
[00:22] <mister2> k cool
[00:22] <abstrakt> s/not/no/
[00:22] <mister2> thanks
[00:22] <Localhost666> i followed some tips to solve my problem with flash running slow..
[00:22] <abstrakt> kdub, um, that's the point? um... yes, in fact now you are agreeing with my original point, thank you
[00:22] <Localhost666> but the problem continues
[00:23] <Localhost666> can someone give another tip?
[00:23] <itaylor57> phux: solarix x86
[00:23] <abstrakt> learn bash and C
[00:23] <matsur> @acicula iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 9999 how would i change this to redirect to loopback?
[00:23] <acicula> matsur: read the man page on what the redirect tag does
[00:23] <kdub> yeah, but phux wants to learn about how the whole system works together, and putting the system together is a good way to learn about all that
[00:23] <Localhost666> someone..?

[00:25] <abstrakt> phux, do as you like, putting random pieces together means relatively little... learning to program is quite useful - you're better off reading The FreeBSD Handbook than doing LFS
[00:25] <acicula> matsur: oh i see what you mean, ehm, sec
[00:25] <abstrakt> phux, or, as I already said, learning C

=== SirLenin is now known as ProLenin
[00:27] <Ben64> scott__: what says 75-99?
[00:27] <acicula> matsur: may run into some routing issues when you connect from local network machines though
[00:27] <scott__> Ben64: The CPU monitor in Docky.
[00:28] <kdub> scott__: on a quad core system, what is reported in top is 100% per core...
[00:28] <Localhost666> ben64:
[00:28] <Ben64> the extra %'s might be iowait or something
[00:28] <Localhost666> can u help me?
[00:28] <phux> alright, thank you guys. i'll stick with ubuntu as main OS (and for learning C/Bash), and give LFS a shot on a little partition till it runs "perfectly" and i feel ready for the switch. think its the best solution :)
[00:28] <Ben64> Localhost666: not if i don't know the problem
[00:28] <acicula> in what world is LFS a solution :/
=== ProLenin is now known as Lenin_Cat

=== ubuntu is now known as pfifo
[00:30] <phux> abstrakt told me to learn, i think because the system is programmed in C?

[00:30] <CobZo> alosa: I don't know but I'm running 9-CURRENT on my desktop and it's pretty solid already
[00:30] <eedeep>  I just up upgraded xubuntu from 10.04 to 10.10 and now my keyboard shortcuts won't work...most importantly the run program dialog! I've been googling but to no avail...anyone seen this before?
[00:30] <Localhost666> Ben64: i saw in the internet that ppl with great fast computers have the same problem..
[00:30] <abstrakt> phux, yeah it's a decent idea to keep 3 partitions (not including swap which would make 4)
[00:31] <abstrakt> phux, one for system, one for alternate system and one for files
[00:31] <abstrakt> phux, then you don't have to worry about A) upgrades or B) recovery
[00:31] <pfifo> abstrakt: why not just have 3 harddrives and one for swap to make 4
[00:31] <CobZo> alosa: it has full dtrace support and zfs v28
[00:31] <phux> abstrakt: as im the careful guy its actually my setup :)
[00:32] <acicula> matsur: can you try the REDIRECT tag and see if that works
[00:32] <abstrakt> pfifo, probably because I personally, have a laptop :)
[00:32] <swatto> Anyone know how to setup VLC for remote control...ive enabled it but i cant seem to get to it in the browser
[00:32] <phux> pfifo: cause i have only 1 laptop
[00:32] <Localhost666> Ben64: is gnash an alternative..?
[00:32] <abstrakt> phux, yeah i love that setup actually, not just for recovery purposes for which it's a real life saver, but for testing too
[00:32] <CobZo> alosa: those are the main reasons why I love it and use it over linux even on my desktop
[00:32] <Khisanth> and 2TB of swap would be very silly :p
[00:32] <pfifo> 3 laptops with ...
[00:32] <abstrakt> phux, lets you play around with multiple distros
[00:32] <scott__> 2 TB of swap???
[00:32] <Ben64> Localhost666: no, the adobe one works fine
[00:32] <scott__> lol
[00:32] <matsur> acicula iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 9999 works fine, it just requires that i ACCEPT on 9999 as well as 80
[00:33] <Localhost666> Ben64: no it doesnt lol
[00:33] <matsur> I'd rath not expose 9999
[00:33] <Ben64> Localhost666: yes it does lol
[00:33] <phux> pfifo: im a f*cking broke student :)
[00:33] <gnosis> phux: if you're looking to do systems programming, then yeah C is good
[00:33] <acicula> matsur: does it redirect the packets to localhost though?
[00:33] <Localhost666> if i try to play youtube videos it just lags my pc
[00:33] <matsur> acicula: 1 sec
[00:33] <Localhost666> i tried to install flash 9 instead of 10 version
[00:33] <bastidrazor> phux: you also have poor english skills. language is to be family friendly
[00:33] <gnosis> phux: but it's not always the most useful day to day
[00:33] <Ben64> Localhost666: you still haven't answered my question

[00:33] <Paddy_NI> Hey I am trying to use my netbook as a wireless access point, so far I am here http://tinyurl.com/6xzces4 at the broadcom section and I have no idea what to do next
[00:33] <kdub> just to be clear, i was never advising phux against learning C :)
[00:34] <matsur> phux look at golang
[00:34] <phux> bastidrazor: dont think that depends on my skills
[00:34] <faryshta> !ogre
[00:34] <matsur> nice and systemy/highlevel cross
[00:34] <pfifo> phux: im just messing around i alwayys do 4 partitions too, if i had 3 harddrives it would still only be seen as 1 ;)
[00:34] <faryshta> !voxel
[00:35] <Localhost666> what do u want to know ben64?
[00:35] <scott__> So Ben64, even though my Docky CPU monitor is saying about 64% cpu use when I'm doing nothing, and gnome-system-monitor is saying I'm only using about %40 at most, which number should I go by? :)
[00:35] <phux> gnosis: yeah, im actually learning RoR and Java
[00:35] <matsur> acicula: it does not, redirects to eth0 9999
[00:36] <acicula> pfifo: that reads as you have to rebuild the kernel driver? => apt-get source your current kernel source tree and make it?
[00:36] <acicula> matsur: eh weird
[00:36] <Ben64> scott__: run 'htop' in the terminal, it will tell you the truth
[00:36] <Ben64> Localhost666: computer specs? gpu, cpu, ram?
[00:36] <scott__> thx
[00:36] <pfifo> acicula: what?
[00:37] <Localhost666> AMD Turion(tm) 64 Mobile Technology MK-36

[00:37] <Omen_20> Could someone explain this stupidity that is adding a printer? It sees My printer plugged in, and its name. I click to use to it, it searches for drivers. Finds them, says they are now in use, all green, looks perfect. Then I press forward again and it pops up another page saying pick out drivers.... why? It just said it found them and put them in use....
[00:37] <acicula> matsur: err wait thats not correct either
[00:37] <v_v> scott__: maybe every time your docky monitor trys to get the cpu usage, itself makes the usage a little more.
[00:38] <Localhost666> ill upload all the info
[00:38] <Localhost666> wait
[00:38] <scott__> Ben64: Ok, Docky's right.  I'm using almost 100% right now, but none of the values below it add up to 100%.
[00:38] <Ben64> scott__: htop says 100% too?
[00:38] <acicula> matsur: http://wiki.debian.org/Firewalls-local-port-redirection this goes through it, but i dont see how that rule is correct
[00:38] <scott__> Ben64: it does

[00:44] <Localhost666> scott_: I just program a lot
[00:44] <pfifo> fisix: 99.9% not a chance
[00:44] <G_Val> i have a problem with boot
[00:44] <hiexpo> !lxde
[00:44] <Localhost666> does it have all the tools i need etc?
[00:45] <Milossh> hello. How can I share folders via commandline
[00:45] <Milossh> ?
[00:45] <acicula> fisix: yes, the password is vulnerable to an offline dictionary attack
[00:45] <scott__> sorry, I guess I didn't read far enough back :)
[00:45] <abstrakt> phux, yes unfortunately many universities have gone java these days
[00:45] <G_Val> i restored a partition/table after accidentally deleted it
[00:45] <abstrakt> phux, really if you wanna learn to program you should read something like this http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/
[00:45] <acicula> fisix: the solution for that is to pick a proper password
[00:45] <gnosis> Milossh: that's not a very detailed question
[00:45] <alosa> CobZo: the zfs v28 is production edition ?
[00:45] <fisix> pfifo, why is that? if somebody has physical access to the comp, can't they just retrieve the hash and crack it?
[00:45] <icarus> heya
[00:45] <Milossh> gnosis: I have ubuntu server in vbox, and I want to acces some of its files. How'd I do that
[00:45] <G_Val> and i tried to boot linux after that, but it freeze on the plymouth
[00:46] <Localhost666> scott_: what are the differences between ubuntu and lubuntu? :x
[00:46] <G_Val> so i updated grub, reistalled driver for video card
[00:46] <G_Val> but nothing changed
[00:46] <icarus> what up ppls..i just installed compsat via the backport package on ubuntu..
[00:46] <icarus> i got a intel adnavnced-n 6200 wireless card
[00:46] <G_Val> I thought maybe it happened because of file system and i check it with gparted on my usb drive
[00:46] <hiexpo> fisix, if you pick a passwork of lengyh of 10 or more and use a small case an upper case  a _ and a number you will be fine
[00:47] <scott__> Localhost666: ubuntu uses the GNOME desktop environment, and Lubuntu uses the LXDE desktop environment.  In Lubuntu, the default browser is chromium, and I believe Claws Mail is the default mail client.  If you used a lighter DE, you'd have more memory for programming. :D
[00:47] <gnosis> abstrakt: nothing wrong with java for learning OOP.  it shouldn't be a first language imo though
[00:47] <icarus> that needs iwlagn
[00:47] <pfifo> fisix: it takes a long time to crack a hash like that, you password wont be much use to the hackerst great grand son when the crack finally finishes
[00:47] <G_Val> it gives me an error while trying to restore the file system
[00:47] <tab1293> where can you read ubuntus install log
[00:47] <G_Val> if you guys need i can give you an fdisk log
[00:47] <Localhost666> scott_: you think i won't notice any difference?
[00:48] <fisix> pfifo, icic. why isn't there a rainbow table attack as with ophcrack->windows?
[00:48] <scott__> Localhost666: I don't know, would you? :)
[00:48] <Tarek> hey
[00:48] <phux> abstrakt: thank you very much, i've been searching a long time for something like that
[00:48] <Localhost666> meh
[00:48] <Localhost666> lol
[00:49] <kdub> abstrakt: i'm with you on that java sentiment
[00:49] <gnosis> Milossh: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/SharedFolders that may or may not help
[00:49] <G_Val> http://paste.ubuntu.com/594267/ hat should i do _ i don-t want to format my hd cause i have another os on it
[00:49] <abstrakt> phux, really, the better universities are going to teach scheme/lisp as a first language... decent universities probably python, run of the mill ones, Java
[00:49] <Tarek> there are ninja or monk in last co or noo ??
[00:49] <hiexpo> fisix, there is but don'tworry about it
[00:49] <G_Val> *what should i do
[00:49] <gnosis> abstrakt: <3 scheme
[00:50] <abstrakt> phux, as mark twain liked to say "I never let my schooling get in the way of my education"
[00:50] <scott__> Ben64: according to htop, my cpu usage has hovered around 100% in at least one of my cores for the last few minutes continuously.  Any more ideas?
[00:50] <fisix> hiexpo, oh i'm worried alright ;). and i guess people can always just change my pass, no? http://www.metacafe.com/watch/738169/linux_local_root_password_hacking/
[00:50] <scott__> I've been googling for a solution and found nothing yet.
[00:50] <pfifo> fisix: i have no idea what ophcrack is but if such a crack was possible, there would be servers getting rooted quite often.
[00:50] <phux> abstrakt: ,gnosis: my first language was opal, a functional language. java is a mercy compared to opal!!!!!
[00:50] <G_Val> scott__: did u read what i wrote ?
[00:51] <gnosis> phux: never heard of that
[00:51] <G_Val> gnosis: did u read what i wrote ?
[00:51] <G_Val> fisix: did u read what i wrote ?
[00:51] <G_Val> any suggestion ?
[00:51] <gnosis> but it looks like shit in the wikipedia article
[00:51] <acicula> fisix: its trivial to change a password if you get physical access, but that wont give you acces to the encrypted data.
[00:51] <pfifo> time to reboot
[00:51] <Localhost666> scott__: is it possible to install lubuntu from my pen drive just like i do with ubuntu?
[00:51] <phux> gnosis: no wonder, my professor developed it himself, it's not used for any program in the world. (my prof stated that himself)
[00:51] <abstrakt> phux, the linux kernel is written in C, much of the linux software available is written in C
[00:52] <gnosis> G_Val: sorry i didn't
[00:52] <fisix> acicula, gotcha that's what i needed to know (:
[00:52] <aeon-ltd> Localhost666: yes, thats possible with 99% of distros
[00:52] <hiexpo> fisix, i am a pen-tester /hacker   so make the password long and use differant tables and you will be fine i would suggest if you are worried 16 or better
[00:52] <abstrakt> phux, linux is really a programmer's OS, if you want to learn linux, learn C (and all the stuff about the tools that help you write it, like gcc and make and automake and autoconf)
[00:52] <kdub> phux: i'd be asking for my money back if i went to that school....
[00:52] <CobZo> alosa: freebsd 8.2 and 8-STABLE are at zfs v15 and 9-CURRENT is at v28, so no
[00:52] <scott__> G_Val, no.  What did you say again?
[00:52] <G_Val> the strange thing is that fdisk can recognize my partition but gparted and live cd partition utility cannot
[00:52] <phux> kdub: i'm from germany, i dont pay for university :)
[00:53] <scott__> Localhost666: I believe so
[00:53] <phux> abstrakt: as i said: thank you, its on my list now :)
[00:53] <s33kr> hi all
[00:53] <CobZo> alosa: but v28 will be backported to 8-STABLE and will probably appear in freebsd 8.3
[00:53] <kdub> phux: oktoberfest!
[00:53] <abstrakt> phux, cool
[00:53] <aeon-ltd> phux: whaaaaat!!! i'm movin now!
[00:53] <abstrakt> phux, you know about rvm right?
[00:53] <gnosis> phux: haha, i hate when profs do shit like that
[00:53] <aeon-ltd> phux: whats the catch? of no uni fees
[00:54] <gnosis> my freshman cs courses taught scheme, ocaml, and java
[00:54] <G_Val> scott__: i have a problem with boot linux os, this happen only after i restored a table-partition which was accidentally deleted with testdisk !
[00:54] <gnosis> ocaml is shit, absolute shit
[00:54] <phux> kdub: im not into that, i come from the other side (north) of germany...we dont like bavarians...
[00:55] <G_Val> scott__: i tried all, grub, reinstall drivers but nothing happen, so i used gparted from livecd and i tried to restore my file system ! but it gives me an error
[00:55] <kdub> aeon-ltd: high income tax is the catch (at least in bavaria)
[00:55] <G_Val> scott__:fdisk recognize my partition as you can see here -> http://paste.ubuntu.com/594267/ but gparted and utility for creating partition integrated in live cd doesn't work
[00:55] <phux> abstrakt: no, excepting you mean revisioning control management (like git)
[00:56] <aeon-ltd> kdub: work in france... :)
[00:56] <phux> aeon-ltd: no catch...
[00:56] <acicula> its full of french :/
[00:56] <abstrakt> phux, http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ use it, enjoy, rinse, repeat
[00:56] <edbian> G_Val: What do you mean it 'doesn't work'  does the partition even show up?
[00:56] <G_Val> scott__: i don't want format my hd cause i have an additional OS !
[00:57] <G_Val> exactly i cannot see partition
[00:57] <G_Val> edbian: i cannot see them, and i can't reinstall only linux os
[00:57] <aeon-ltd> phux: best country ever.
[00:57] <phux> aeon-ltd: well, you gotta pay 300$ per semester but you're getting a metro ticket for that, too
[00:58] <aeon-ltd> phux: thats still good, learn some german, get a degree, lifestyle change. meh esp with high amount of places to rent :)
[00:58] <G_Val> edbian: so i tried to restore file system but it gives me an error
[00:58] <edbian> G_Val: In the upper right hand corner is a hard drive selector thingy.  Are you looking at the right hdd ?
[00:58] <G_Val> edbian: yes man as you can see i have only 2 hd
[00:59] <G_Val> edbian: sda is ehre my linnux and win os are located
[00:59] <edbian> G_Val: screen shot me what gparted sees on the harddrive you're trying to edit.  Can you do that?
[00:59] <G_Val> edbian: is where*
[00:59] <edbian> G_Val: I see that.
[00:59] <G_Val> sure but is quite easy ! it says unallocated space xD
[01:00] <G_Val> edbian: sure but is quite easy ! it says unallocated space xD
[01:00] <edbian> G_Val: no picture then.  What does the other drive show in gparted?
[01:00] <gnosis> phux: *jealousy*  college is fucking expensive in the US
[01:00] <phux> aeon-ltd: what would you say if i tell you that you also get up to 700$ each month(depending on your parents' income) and you gotta pay back at most the half? :P
[01:01] <G_Val> edbian: the secnd one could be recognized and works greatly
[01:02] <G_Val> edbian: only  the first one cannot be seen idk why
[01:02] <edbian> G_Val: I think the partition table is messed up.  I'm not really sure.  You should use dd to make a backup or something right now
[01:02] <edbian> G_Val: wait
[01:02] <gnosis> phux: my ex-g/f has >$100k in school loans
[01:02] <phux> gnosis: yeah, i think it's not the best idea to reserve the education for the better earning families
[01:02] <aeon-ltd> phux: ok there is something seriously wrong with all the other countries in the world, except netherlands & germany
[01:02] <edbian> !ot
[01:02] <ubottu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[01:03] <aeon-ltd> edbian: sorry i'll go there now
[01:03] <edbian> aeon-ltd: no worries! :)
[01:03] <s33kr> any server for random help about linux?
[01:03] <edbian> I just wanna talk about Ubuntu
[01:03] <edbian> s33kr: There is a linux channel on this server I believe
[01:03] <Paddy_NI> s33kr: ##linux perhaps
[01:03] <G_Val> edbian: man i check my data on the first HD and there is no issue with that ! Maybe if i can reinstall only the os i am so happy, or i can back up my data from old partition and "paste" on the new one ! A secure backup is appreciated also
[01:04] <phux> abstrakt: yes, but as im still in a single "development" environment, ill put it at the bottom of my list
[01:04] <Technicus> Hello . . . how do I find the title of a window?  I am trying to embed konsole on a Gnome desktop.  This is the tutirial I am following: [ http://www.webupd8.org/2009/05/ubuntu-embed-terminal-into-you-desktop.html ].  For it to work I need to know the title of the konsole window that opens.
[01:04] <edbian> G_Val: I think if you partition again with gparted there will be no issue (besides your data being erased).  What initially caused this problem?
[01:04] <KINGOFSWORDS> hi
[01:04] <edbian> Technicus: The 'title' is what shows up in the title bar (next to the x + and -)
[01:05] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: hello :)
[01:05] <KINGOFSWORDS> i have no titlebar on my windwows....is there anyway of sorting this out without restarting compiz?
[01:05] <KINGOFSWORDS> hi edbian
[01:05] <G_Val> edbian: i accidentally deleted original patition-table with testdisk...but i immediately restored it
[01:05] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: go to tty1, run this: compiz --replace&, switch back to graphics
[01:05] <KINGOFSWORDS> is ttyl a cmd or program?
[01:05] <edbian> G_Val: That is probably what gparted is freaking about.  Perhaps it isn't restored or it isn't restored correctly
[01:06] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: press ctrl + alt + F1 to switch to it.  It's a virtual terminal.
[01:06] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: you can switch back by ctrl + alt + F7  (graphical)
[01:06] <G_Val> !time
[01:06] <matsur> acicula: got it! iptables -I INPUT 3 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 9999 --sport 80 -j ACCEPT just needed to add the sport
[01:06] <ubottu> Information about using and setting your computer's clock on Ubuntu can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime - See https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/NTP.html for information on usage of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
[01:07] <G_Val> edbian: so should i reinstall all ?
[01:07] <acicula> matsur: using DNAT or REDIRECT?
[01:07] <edbian> G_Val: If you can.  I"m in over my head now
[01:07] <matsur> REDIRECT
[01:07] <KINGOFSWORDS> ctrl alt F1 just goes to black screen
[01:07] <jzacsh_> anyone know how to get (or what its called ) smjs (or the spidermonkey javascript shell) in ubuntu?
[01:07] <jzacsh_> http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/smjs.1.html
[01:07] <G_Val> edbian: how long are u here ?
[01:07] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: press enter on that screen. There should be a thing to log in.
[01:07] <edbian> G_Val: what do you mean?
[01:07] <KINGOFSWORDS> nah theres nothing there ...just a bit of static at top of screen
[01:08] <G_Val> edbian: is there a way to not reinstall all programs after formatting ? something to restore all from old partition's data
[01:08] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: Can you press alt + F2 to launch a command window thingy
[01:08] <matsur> acicula: a little odd... everything i can find online seems to suggest redirect puts stuff onto loopback, but i have a catch all accept everything on lo rule as rule 1 in INPUT and it was not working
[01:08] <G_Val> edbian: i mean today
[01:08] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: I'm betting since you don't have borders that you can't just open a terminal or we'd use that
[01:08] <hiexpo> command window thingy     hehe
[01:09] <KINGOFSWORDS> ctrl alt f2 is messed up too
[01:09] <KINGOFSWORDS> but normal terminal is okk
[01:09] <edbian> G_Val: You can use dd to copy from the entire partition to a folder or another partition. (make a backup)  Then partition the disk and put the copies into those partitions.
[01:09] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: ok great.  Can you type in the normal terminal?
[01:09] <mr0wl> Is GNOME 3 available on Natty?
[01:09] <edbian> hiexpo: :)
[01:09] <KINGOFSWORDS> edbiian just ran ur cmd in normal terminal and worked great ty
[01:10] <acicula> matsur: yeah, all this does is a more precise match, so dunno
[01:10] <edbian> mr0wl: natty is going to use unity instead of gnome3  (but they are similar)
[01:10] <G_Val> edbian: ok but what about my win os ?
[01:10] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: glad I could help
[01:10] <KINGOFSWORDS> is ctrl alt f1 or f2 the terminal outside of the gui?
[01:10] <edbian> G_Val: You can do the same thing
[01:10] <acicula> mr0wl: nope, there are ppa's though
[01:10] <KINGOFSWORDS> is it a problem that it doesnt work? maybe a graphics driver issue
[01:10] <G_Val> edbian: so many data
[01:10] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: Yes.  There should be 6 virtual terminals on F1 through F6 (F7 is graphical)
[01:10] <G_Val> edbian: soo *
[01:10] <KINGOFSWORDS> would update sort that out?
[01:11] <G_Val> edbian: soo i have to reinstall all O__O
[01:11] <mr0wl> The PPAs are for Natty only?
[01:11] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: Sometimes the graphics driver chops it off though.  Try using the auto -thingy on the monitor
[01:11] <matsur> acicula: this does a more precise match on 9999 input... previously 9999 was open and connectable, now it appears closed. thats all i was going for, the redirect worked fine before
[01:11] <edbian> G_Val: I know.  That's the problem
[01:11] <acicula> mr0wl: no
[01:11] <edbian> G_Val: You don't have to reinstall.  YOu just have to partition
[01:11] <KINGOFSWORDS> auto thingy?
[01:11] <G_Val> edbian: i cannot restore only windows partition table and install onoly linux ? i mean from testdisk
[01:11] <KINGOFSWORDS> oh its laptop
[01:11] <acicula> matsur: ah ok
[01:11] <mr0wl> K gonna try it out.
[01:11] <KINGOFSWORDS> no auto tune
[01:11] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: Oh, then nevermind the laptop monitor probably doesn't have the auto-thingy
[01:11] <mr0wl> Thanks
[01:11] <KINGOFSWORDS> yeh
[01:12] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: I'm not sure why TTY1 isn't working
[01:12] <hiexpo> you needto open that thingy and type out that thangy     omg
[01:12] <KNUBBIG> Hi, I booted back into the live cd and tried cfdisk which doesnt work and gparted which again tells me wrong partitions. Any ideas
[01:12] <edbian> haha
[01:12] <acicula> mr0wl: best follow up in #ubuntu+1, its meant for natty. Also make sure you know how to undo the changes you make as you may runinto some problems
[01:12] <edbian> words words words
[01:12] <KINGOFSWORDS> ive been in the non gui b4 but think it was on karmic
[01:12] <swatto> Anyone know how to map the windows key to open terminal? Tried adding through keyboard shortcuts but it wont let me use it?
[01:12] <mr0wl> Ok, will do.
[01:12] <G_Val> edbian: did u understand what i mean ?
[01:13] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: All versions should have it.  Strange that it isn't working
[01:13] <edbian> G_Val: no, rephrase it please
[01:13] <G_Val> edbian: i cannot restore only windows partition table and install onoly linux ? i mean from testdisk
[01:13] <KINGOFSWORDS> i had real bad problems installing graphics driver so think that has coused a comflict or s'thing
[01:13] <hiexpo> KINGOFSWORDS, is becoming aregular customer here   :)
[01:13] <KINGOFSWORDS> btw is it possible to downgrade wine?
[01:14] <hiexpo> !downgrade
[01:14] <ubottu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported and may break your system.
[01:14] <KINGOFSWORDS> lol true...this is my linux school =)
=== torjehoa is now known as cybrhuman
[01:14] <edbian> G_Val: Not exactly re-phrased but.  There is 1 partition table for each harddrive.  Not for each partition or each OS.  It sounds to me like the partition table for that harddrive is messed up or wrong which is why gparted can't see the partitions but fdisk can
[01:14] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: That is very likely to have caused the problem yes
[01:14] <alosa> CobZo http://mfsbsd.vx.sk/
[01:14] <Ben64> KINGOFSWORDS: open synaptic, find wine, and it will let you choose version
[01:14] <KINGOFSWORDS> no not downgraded wine yet....
[01:15] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: uninstall wine.  Then use synaptic to force install an old version
[01:15] <KNUBBIG> G_Val, what is your prob? Sounds similar to mine
[01:15] <edbian> (it is possible)
[01:15] <KINGOFSWORDS> yeh i stupdily dled wine 1.3
[01:15] <G_Val> edbian: yes maybe i can restore the partition table by deleting linux from that
[01:15] <KINGOFSWORDS> or the newest ver
[01:15] <Ben64> KINGOFSWORDS: whats wrong with 1.3?
[01:15] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: You shouldn't be downloading anything.  use the wine that is in the repos
[01:15] <hiexpo> or compile it yourself is better
[01:15] <G_Val> KNUBBIG: which one ? i can open a blog called "the issues of ubuntu"
[01:15] <KINGOFSWORDS> will i lose my programs thou if i uninstall or downgrade?
[01:15] <edbian> G_Val: IDK man.  You can try.  I don't know how to manually edit the partition table of a hdd
[01:15] <KNUBBIG> G_Val, ;d, the one with the partitions
[01:15] <KINGOFSWORDS> sorry yeh i used synaptic to dl
[01:16] <KINGOFSWORDS> Ben64 isnt 1.3 a beta/testing ver
[01:16] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: I am pretty sure you can remove wine.  You shouldn't lose the programs because they aren't part of hte package
[01:16] <G_Val> KNUBBIG: uhm i cannot boot linux os cause i accidentally deleted a partition-table but i restored immediately
[01:16] <Ben64> KINGOFSWORDS: its development yeah, but it works fine
[01:16] <G_Val> KNUBBIG: Strangest thing never happen : windows os works great linux doesn't
[01:16] <maguey_> What shall modif in my ~/.screenrc in order to be able to open X apps
[01:16] <KINGOFSWORDS> wine 1.3 kinda hangs and the GUI messes up s'times
[01:17] <swatto> I have added a program to the Startup Applications list but i do not have an autorun directory in my home folder?
[01:17] <G_Val> edbian: i will try in this way i cannot delete windows data i have no enough space
[01:17] <KINGOFSWORDS> it might be the same in a lower ver thou
[01:17] <KNUBBIG> G_Val, okay, my windows also detects partitions correctly and Ubuntu doesnt
[01:17] <edbian> G_Val: ok?
[01:17] <KINGOFSWORDS> gta san andreas plays great in it thou..so shouldnt complain
[01:17] <G_Val> KNUBBIG: only fdisk recognize them
[01:18] <KNUBBIG> G_Val, my fdisk partly recognises them, but not completely correct
[01:18] <G_Val> edbian: ok ehat man sorry ? i am in over my head also
[01:18] <KNUBBIG> I cant even install Ubuntu :(
[01:18] <G_Val> edbian: i am trying t find solution by 4 days
[01:18] <edbian> G_Val: yeah.  I can't offer advice about what to do :(
[01:18] <edbian> G_Val: ouch.  Sorry to hear that
[01:18] <hiexpo> dev is always better i think but one reason ubuntu don't use dev's is cause the chance of problems and support and ubuntu is aimed at helpingnew users from microft to llinux
[01:19] <G_Val> KNUBBIG:  yes but before worked great
[01:19] <edbian> KNUBBIG: what is stopping you?
[01:19] <G_Val> edbian: don't worry is normal for teenagers xD
[01:19] <KINGOFSWORDS> edbian ; got this in terminal after ur cmd [1] 2061

[01:19] <ssmmdd> Hi, I can't get Ubuntu to start from CD or Install onto my system as it can't seem to find or connect to my SATA RAID Array. Is there anything I can do? Asus Motherboard with an Nvidia Chipset.
[01:20] <KNUBBIG> edbian, neither fdisk nor gparted detect the right partitions, Im running a fake raid and somehow Ubuntu tries to detect the partitions on the first member disk of the array which is kinda stupid
[01:20] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: On the top and bottom of the cube are pictures.  There is a setting to point to what file to use for that picture.  The error is saying that that file does not exist.
[01:20] <edbian> KNUBBIG: Mmmm, Ubuntu with raids.  I have no experience with that :(
[01:20] <terje_> q/bye
[01:20] <KINGOFSWORDS> ah ..so its just because i changed the picture then moved/deleted png?
[01:21] <KNUBBIG> edbian, :( I thought I had, had the same setup with a similar onboard controller running on my old comp :(
[01:21] <edbian> KNUBBIG: :(
[01:21] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: yes probably
[01:21] <KINGOFSWORDS> cool thank you very much
[01:21] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, is there any error message?
[01:22] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: because you ran compiz in the terminal you will see all sorts of errors.  Most of them can probably be ignored.
[01:22] <G_Val> edbian: what is DD ?
=== alien_ is now known as Guest4023
[01:22] <edbian> G_Val: It's a command in the terminal.  It converts and copies things.  look at man dd
[01:23] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: Running from CD: No, it just freezes. When trying to install, it asks if SATA RAID should be activated, I say yes, but then shows no partitions. I should mention it's RAID 5 and NTFS.
[01:23] <G_Val> edbian: ok i will thanks anyway man !
[01:23] <KINGOFSWORDS> yeh i seen the same one the other day...remember getting a logo or s'thing on top of cube
[01:23] <MK`> I want to connect to a "Microsoft XPS Document Writer", which printer driver do I select? Generic?
[01:24] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: And Windows is already Installed (but don't want to use the Windows Install Version.
[01:24] <a3Deb> Where's the trash
[01:24] <s33kr> hi
[01:24] <oscargot>  a3Deb: The trash bin?
[01:24] <a3Deb> ya
[01:25] <a3Deb> i think it's goine
[01:25] <a3Deb> gone*
[01:25] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, okay so Ive got no idea, sorry, I also cant get Ubuntu to detect my correct disk layout on my RAID
[01:25] <oscargot> a3Deb: are you in Ubuntu? Did you change anythin/
[01:25] <PW-toXic> hi, my samba server doesnt work anymore.. can someone give me a hint how i can debug it?
[01:25] <a3Deb> i'm on backtrack
[01:25] <a3Deb> which is like ubuntu
[01:25] <ssmmdd> Hmmm, bugger. No one from Ubuntu support atm?
[01:25] <ssmmdd> + around
[01:26] <edbian> ssmmdd: we're here
[01:26] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: What Motherboard, what Chipset?
[01:26] <edbian> a3Deb: Then we can't help :(
[01:26] <ssmmdd> Ah, okay edbian. :)
[01:26] <edbian> a3Deb: This is Ubuntu support
[01:26] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, ASUS P8P67  Pro, Intel Controller
[01:26] <a3Deb> backtrack is ubuntu
[01:27] <Ben64> no, ubuntu is ubuntu
[01:27] <genii-around> !backtrack
[01:27] <ubottu> There are some Ubuntu derivatives that we cannot provide support for due to repository and software changes. Please consult their websites for more information. Examples: gNewSense (support in #gnewsense), Linux Mint (see !mint), LinuxMCE (support in #linuxmce), CrunchBang (support in #crunchbang), BackTrack (support in #backtrack-linux), Ultimate Edition
[01:27] <edbian> a3Deb: They are similar but not the same
[01:27] <ssmmdd> Hmmmm, Ubuntu must not like 3rd party RAID Controllers, do you know if yours is Hardware or Software RAID?
[01:27] <a3Deb> well this sucks...
[01:27] <xiamx> Is there anyway to control the bandwidth and speed of a openvpn client?
[01:27] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, software afaik
[01:27] <edbian> a3Deb: Go to the backtrack channel
[01:27] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: Hmmmm, Ubuntu must not like 3rd party RAID Controllers, do you know if yours is Hardware or Software RAID?
[01:27] <KINGOFSWORDS> any1 heard of plymouth for ubuntu?
[01:27] <a3Deb> i thought backtrack was ubuntu except with "hacker" files
[01:28] <ssmmdd> Hmmmm, mine's Hardware.
[01:28] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: I've heard of it.  Make splash screens during boot
[01:28] <ssmmdd> What RAID, KNUBBIG? 0? 1?
[01:28] <edbian> a3Deb: I'm not sure of the exact differences.  They are similar though
[01:28] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, 1
[01:28] <a3Deb> so join #backtrack
[01:28] <ssmmdd> I can never remember if that's Backup or Speed...
[01:28] <KINGOFSWORDS> oh ok i thought it says it will sort out my virtual terminal and glx problem
[01:28] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, speed
[01:28] <ssmmdd> Ah. Ta. :)
[01:28] <a3Deb> thanks guys
[01:28] <ssmmdd> 5 is both.
[01:29] <ssmmdd> But you need 3+ HDDs.
[01:29] <KNUBBIG> np :), yup but
[01:29] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: Not that I know of but possibly
[01:29] <KNUBBIG> yes :D
[01:29] <ssmmdd> Expense ++
[01:29] <ssmmdd> Anyway, hopefully someone can help us soon. :)
[01:29] <arch_is_awesome> Hello, I was wondering: If I get the 11.04 beta will it upgrade to stable once it comes out?
[01:30] <arch_is_awesome> Or will it be a mess?
[01:30] <KNUBBIG> I hope so, the last idea I got was to remake all partitions so the partition table might be fixed, but thats not guaranteed
[01:30] <edbian> arch_is_awesome: yes
[01:30] <edbian> arch_is_awesome: (it might be a mess)
[01:31] <KINGOFSWORDS> is it ok 2 update grub?
[01:31] <arch_is_awesome> Okay, thanks. edbian: Do you have nightlies?
[01:31] <yock> Should I be able to upgrade to the Natty beta from Maverick in the Update Manager?
[01:31] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: Nah, I was assuming it would see the partitions and you could just install it next to Windows.
[01:31] <KINGOFSWORDS> will it affect anything
[01:31] <edbian> arch_is_awesome: Do I have nightlies?
[01:31] <arch_is_awesome> Does ubuntu?
[01:31] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, that was true for my old PC, but somehow it isnt for the new one
[01:31] <edbian> yock: not unless you do update-manager -d in the term
[01:31] <edbian> arch_is_awesome: I don't know...
[01:31] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: You have Windows Intalled?
[01:31] <arch_is_awesome> Nightly builds..
[01:31] <edbian> arch_is_awesome: Ubuntu is not arch ;)
[01:31] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, zes
[01:31] <arch_is_awesome> haha
[01:31] <KNUBBIG> yes, damn kb layout
[01:32] <arch_is_awesome> Okay then bye
[01:32] <edbian> hahaha
[01:32] <ssmmdd> Version? HDD Formatting type?
[01:32] <edbian> arch_is_awesome should just use arch!
[01:32] <MK`> I want to connect to a "Microsoft XPS Document Writer" on my network, which printer driver do I select? Generic?
[01:32] <patr> hi on ubuntu 10.10 2006 comp
[01:32] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, Win 7, what do you mean with formatting type?
[01:32] <yock> edbian: Thanks!
[01:32] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: FAT32? NTFS?
[01:32] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, NTFS
[01:32] <patr> idk
[01:32] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: 32 or 64 bit?
[01:33] <edbian> yock: no problem  (it worked ?)
[01:33] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, 64
[01:33] <ssmmdd> Hmmm.
[01:33] <yock> edbian: Yep. Updating now.
[01:33] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: Wonder if it's something to do with Win 64 bit / NTFS?
[01:33] <patr> try virtual box have a win7 cd right?
[01:33] <edbian> yock: Hope you like it!!!
[01:33] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, dont think so, had that on my old pc, too
[01:33] <ssmmdd> Ah, okay.
[01:34] <diego_> #tupa
[01:34] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: Must simply be that it doesn't like our RAID Controllers without special Drivers.
[01:34] <patr> if your runing 32 bit  you cant run 64bit
[01:34] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, true :)
[01:34] <patr> win 7-vista only can take ntfs
[01:34] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: I know Windows has a mode so you can pre-load specially needed Drivers during Install.
[01:34] <arch_is_awesome> edibuntu: Ubuntu calls them daily instead of nightly.
[01:34] <edbian> patr: but Ubuntu can read ntfs
[01:34] <arch_is_awesome> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/
[01:34] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: Not sure if Ubuntu does it too.
[01:34] <patr> xp or win2k  cna take fat 32
[01:34] <edbian> patr: but Ubuntu can read/write* ntfs
[01:35] <edbian> arch_is_awesome: there ya go
[01:35] <arch_is_awesome> Thanks
[01:35] <edbian> arch_is_awesome: You should just use arch :)
[01:35] <arch_is_awesome> Arch is messy
[01:35] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, mh, no idea too, but it detects _some_ partitions on my RAID, but not all ...
[01:35] <patr> i know just saying
[01:35] <ssmmdd> edbian: Any idea with mine & KNUBBIG's problem?
[01:35] <edbian> ssmmdd: no clue
[01:35] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: Lucky, I get none at all.
[01:35] <edbian> ssmmdd: :(
[01:35] <edbian> arch_is_awesome: arch is awesome
[01:35] <patr> what is a rsid card?
[01:36] <patr> raid card
[01:36] <ssmmdd> edbian: Okay, no problem, should I post the problem on a forum or does Ubuntu have some sort of support centre?
[01:36] <arch_is_awesome> I actually like arch! Yet, Ubuntu is good. I am not a fanboy of any distro: quadruple booting Arch, Chakra, Ubuntu, and Fedora
[01:36] <bruenig> arch is not messy, it is super clean
[01:36] <patr> what is a raid card?
[01:36] <edbian> patr: raid lets you connect multiple hdds into cool configurations like automatic backup or striping to improve performance
[01:36] <arch_is_awesome> Two are arch based!
[01:36] <ssmmdd> eddyarif: Christ you type fast!
[01:36] <edbian> ssmmdd: You're in the support center.  A forum post is a great idea.
[01:36] <ssmmdd> edbian *
[01:37] <edbian> ssmmdd: but first search google
[01:37] <ssmmdd> Good idea.
[01:37]  * ssmmdd slaps Google.
[01:37] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: If I find anything, I'll poke you.
[01:37] <edbian> arch_is_awesome: what is chakra  ?
[01:37] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, thanks
[01:37] <diego_> #tupa
[01:37] <patr> wow how can a pc have a raid do it need to be a server like desktop
[01:37] <edbian> ssmmdd: I type fast?
[01:37] <arch_is_awesome> An arch-based live usb/cd with KDE
[01:37] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: Am I okay to PM? This Channel's pretty busy.
[01:37] <arch_is_awesome> chakra-project.org
[01:37] <ssmmdd> edbian: You seem to, yes.
[01:37] <KINGOFSWORDS> how do i creade a file?
[01:37] <bruenig> arch and chakra are the same thing
[01:38] <edbian> patr: It needs to either have a card (hardware raid) or support in the motherboard or the OS can do it.
[01:38] <edbian> ssmmdd: Thanks :)
[01:38] <diego_> \join #tupa
[01:38] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: what type of file?
[01:38] <KNUBBIG> ssmmdd, of course, thanks
[01:38] <arch_is_awesome> http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=chakra
[01:38] <KINGOFSWORDS> dunno it just says create one for /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-fix.conf:
[01:38] <arch_is_awesome> well bye
[01:38] <edbian> patr: If the OS does it I believe it's called a software raid.  I"m not sure.  There may be another type of software raid.
[01:38] <arch_is_awesome> \quit
[01:38] <arch_is_awesome> oops
[01:38] <ssmmdd> KNUBBIG: Okay, I'll give Google a good kicking.
[01:38] <patr> macpro has that option how many drives can it support think 4
[01:39] <KINGOFSWORDS> oh guess conf file then:s
[01:39] <KNUBBIG> thanks
[01:39] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: that's a text file.  gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-fix.conf
[01:39] <patr> installing wifi drivers lol
[01:39] <edbian> patr: That's a software raid
[01:39] <KINGOFSWORDS> great thx
[01:39] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: no problem
[01:39] <patr> get ati its better
[01:40] <patr> nivida is for intel wawa
[01:40] <edbian> patr: nvidia is owned by intel
[01:40] <patr> sdd support in linux 10.10
[01:41] <CCNY> howdy guys, I'm working on a 'buntu meerkat server, I'm trying to setup a server that will handle both linux and windows logins, but the server has to get its accounts from a network-wide windows domain controller... any ideas?
[01:41] <patr> what!
[01:41] <HyperShock> edbian: What?! Since when did that happen?
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[01:41] <patr> how can ati interfer with intel boards
[01:41] <PW-toXic_> Can someone tell me how i can make samba listen to all interfaces?
[01:41] <Eighteens> Ok, this ip comes back to amazon.com why would they be trying to hack into my box, `Apr 14 13:47:35 ubuntudesktop kernel: [22256.409617] [UFW BLOCK] IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=00:14:2a:c9:c9:39:00:22:3f:c6:68:f5:08:00 SRC=72.21.206.84`
[01:42] <edbian> HyperShock: Ohh maybe I'm wrong?  AMD owns ATI
[01:42] <brightspark> How can I remove old keyboard layouts from the menu that shows up when I click my picture at the login screen?
[01:42] <HyperShock> PW-toXic_: goto chan #samba
[01:42] <CCNY> AMD does own ATI
[01:42] <HyperShock> edbian: yes, amd owns ati, but nvidia is still their own cool rocking selves. :)
[01:42] <edbian> HyperShock: Thanks for calling me out!
[01:42] <gnosis> Eighteens: why do you think they're trying to hack you?
[01:43]  * HyperShock gives edbian a cookie and a correct time out.
[01:43] <Eighteens> all these wierd things in kern.log
[01:43] <edbian> Eighteens: That's called a script kiddy.  The IP is probably spoofed
[01:43] <patr> CCNY: yeah thats right
[01:43] <qbex> O q e isso?
[01:43] <patr> amd rools
[01:43] <gnosis> Eighteens: amazon rents out servers
[01:43] <KNUBBIG> why the hell would apt-get install mdadm install postfix, wtf
[01:44] <Eighteens> edbian: gnosis: ok, thank you for the info
[01:44] <patr> wow you two type fast!
[01:44] <HyperShock> KNUBBIG: have you got some nonstandard repos enabled? that would explain it.
[01:44] <KNUBBIG> HyperShock, no, booting from live cd
[01:44] <edbian> I don't type that fast!!! :(
[01:45] <patr> got to reboot
[01:45] <oscargot> If I have a discrete ATI graphics card and I've activated the use of proprietary drivers, do I get updates for the graphics card automatically or should I download them manually in order to stay up to date?
[01:45] <patr> oem disconecting
[01:46] <HyperShock> KNUBBIG: which live cd?
[01:46] <PW-toXic_> HyperShock, this channel seems to be quite inaktive ;)
[01:46] <rcconf> where is located crontab file?
[01:46] <edbian> oscargot: You got automatic updates.  A version of the proprietary driver is maintained in the fglrx package
[01:46] <CCNY> oscargot: should update by itself
[01:46] <brightspark> I wish I did, but it's my first week on dvorak and sadly I'm not up to speed yet.
[01:46] <Ben64> oscargot: the package will update automatically when necessary, if you do it manually you can break it
[01:47] <oscargot> mmm so many replies >: )
[01:47] <oscargot> CCNY: edbian: Ben64: Thx guys
[01:47] <CCNY> yup.
[01:47] <edbian> oscargot: sure
[01:47] <Ben64> oscargot: np
[01:48] <gnosis> rcconf: under /etc
[01:48] <KNUBBIG> HyperShock, sorry, currently 1104
[01:48] <KNUBBIG> HyperShock, but nvm Ill try another thing to get Ubuntu to install :p brb
[01:49] <rcconf> gnosis: thanks but it doesnt contain my crontab settings
[01:50] <KINGOFSWORDS> do i need to update in update mgr? will it effect my setup?
[01:50] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: how else would you update?
[01:51] <KINGOFSWORDS> yeh i keep reading on forums thread where ppl keep getting problems and bugs after updates
[01:51] <rcconf> How do I find an old .deb package
[01:51] <rcconf> http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/amd64/ettercap-common/download
[01:51] <rcconf> I dont want the latest version
[01:51] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: people think they cause bugs but I don't think they do as often as people think.  generally updating is a good idea
[01:51] <gnosis> rcconf: sorry, they're actually in /var/spool/cron/crontabs
[01:51] <KINGOFSWORDS> will update sort out conflicts and dodgy things ive dome to my os
[01:52] <gnosis> but you shouldn't edit them directly
[01:52] <rcconf> gnosis: i just want to copy
[01:52] <rcconf> :)
[01:52] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: likely they won't make any difference.
[01:52] <KINGOFSWORDS> yeh true alot of time its human error and paranoia that causes problems
[01:52] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: updating is a good idea :)
[01:53] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: It's one of the best features of linux!
[01:53] <KINGOFSWORDS> ur advice has been good so far so ill do it...
[01:53] <gnosis> KINGOFSWORDS: at minimum do the security updates
[01:53] <gnosis> no reason to leave your box vulnerable
[01:53] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: haha.  Thanks.  I've never seen anybody not want to update before!
[01:54] <KINGOFSWORDS> i had issue with kernel obstructing internet connection so was fearful of updating it and grub
[01:54] <edbian> KINGOFSWORDS: kernels updates are rare.  Plus the old versions are left in the grub menu so you can still use them after an update
[01:55] <KINGOFSWORDS> ok
[01:55] <brightspark> How can I remove old keyboard layouts from the menu that shows up when I click my picture at the login screen?
[01:55] <KINGOFSWORDS> hopefully sort my virtual KB issue
[01:56] <Jetpack> Hey, I'm looking for a new laptop that will work well on Ubuntu, but also have decent graphics support, for under $1000, anyone have any suggestions?
[01:56] <rogerio> hi
[01:56] <edbian> Jetpack: any of them?  hahaha
[01:56] <rogerio> is Ubuntu 10.10 LSB compliant?
[01:57] <CCNY> jetpack: I've had a lot of luck with HP, but don't go with their bargain-bin computers
[01:57] <rcconf> gnosis: /media/XXX/var/spool/crob/crontabs/USER ;)
[01:57] <rcconf> using root
[01:57] <Jetpack> edbian: I just got a laptop, but it had nVidia Optimus.  Apparently there is no support for it, and most new laptops come with it.
[01:57] <CCNY> I have a nice HP tablet PC that runs nicely
[01:57] <edbian> Jetpack: ahh, I'm not up to date on that.
[01:58] <Jetpack> I meant to include a decent graphics card
[01:58] <rogerio> someone can say me if Ubuntu current stable version 10.10 is LSB compliant?
[01:58] <pfifo> xubuntu 10.10 looks exactly the same as gnome
[01:58] <gnosis> rcconf: ?
[01:59] <rcconf> gnosis: crontab thing.
[01:59] <edbian> pfifo: It uses the same toolkit to draw the gui (gtk)
[01:59] <ziltoid83> hallo
[02:00] <ziltoid83> i has question
[02:00] <pfifo> ok i have a question, I cant sudo, i am in both the sudo and admin and root groups, i have uncommented lines in sudoers, using visudo, done this over 9000 time but this time I cant get it to work.
[02:00] <edbian> pfifo: log out and back in
[02:00] <ziltoid83> can ubuntu's startup disk creator make a bootable usb of puppy linux from an iso?
[02:01] <pfifo> edbian, i did thrice, set a valid hostname, setup a hosts file, natty, i mean notta
[02:01] <edbian> pfifo: Can you pastebin /etc/sudoers for me?
[02:01] <pfifo> yes
[02:01] <gnosis> pfifo: what happens when you try to sudo?
[02:02] <brightspark> rogerio, no.  it uses debs instead of rpms
[02:02] <pfifo> gnosis, it says "pfifo is not in the sudoers file, this incident will be reported'
[02:03] <pfifo> ROOT can use sudo no problem
[02:03] <rogerio> just for this reason?
[02:03] <Ben64> pfifo: root doesn't need to use sudo
[02:03] <rogerio> ok. thanks for answer
[02:03] <pfifo> edbian, http://pastebin.com/Kraq1p7F
[02:04] <pfifo> Ben64, of course, but root cn still run the command, and it works as expected
[02:04] <Ben64> root can run anything with full permissions
[02:04] <rogerio> so Debian, is not LSB compliant too...
[02:04] <Ben64> pfifo: anyway, you need to make sure your user is part of the 'admin' group
[02:04] <edbian> pfifo: is admin a group or a user?
[02:05] <FloatingGoat> yo ubuntu people, where is the unity channel? :D
[02:05] <pfifo> root@pfifo-laptop:/home/pfifo# groups pfifo
[02:05] <pfifo> pfifo : pfifo root sudo audio video admin gdm
[02:05] <brightspark> rogerio, there may be others.  and you are correct about debian
[02:05] <edbian> pfifo: if admin is a group then in /etc/sudoers you need %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
[02:05] <edbian> a percent sign is needed for groups
[02:06] <Ben64> edbian: nice catch, i didn't notice the missing %
[02:06] <edbian> Ben64: :)
[02:06] <edbian> thanks
[02:06] <pfifo> ahh a % edbian i haven't tried it butknow thats it, good catch
[02:06] <brightspark> How can I remove old keyboard layouts from the menu that shows up when I click my picture at the login screen?
[02:06] <rcconf> I am trying to download ettercap-common_0.7.3-2ubuntu1_amd64.deb
[02:07] <edbian> pfifo: thanks :)
[02:07] <rcconf> but version before
[02:07] <edbian> glad I could help

[02:07] <rcconf> How can I download the version before of ettercap-common_0.7.3-2ubuntu1_amd64.deb
[02:07] <pfifo> edbian, confirmed working, thanks
[02:07] <edbian> pfifo: awesome
[02:08] <pfifo> I have another question, how do i disable the root account after enabling it
[02:08] <edbian> pfifo: ummm, remove it's password I believe
[02:09] <edbian> pfifo: Why did you create a root?  Why did you take pseudo away from yourself?
[02:09] <Ben64> change password to ! in the shadow file
[02:09] <pfifo> edbian, due to the sudo problem, i setup root password for maintence
[02:10] <edbian> pfifo: How did you loose sudo for yourself?
[02:10] <AegisX> Hi guys; I'm looking to make my Ubuntu laptop and Windows 7 desktop work together. This would include synching certain folders, ability to control my Windows box from Linux (is this SSH? I'm not too familiar with networking) and so on. Does anyone have any pointers?
[02:10] <pfifo> edbian, i installed via debootstrap, cause i wanted xubuntu and only have the ubuntu iso on my memory stik
[02:11] <pfifo> edbian, so the never was sudo or pfifo or anything
[02:11] <KM0201> AegisX, syncing folders should be easy, SSH should work your needs, but if you want a "easy" way to do that.. look up "Teamviewer" it has a Linux and Windows version, and will make controlling either desktop from the other, very easy
[02:11] <Ben64> pfifo: make root's line in /etc/shadow similar to mine "root:!:13818:0:99999:7:::"
[02:11] <edbian> pfifo: I see!  fixed now :)
[02:12] <edbian> AegisX: You can set up ssh server on windows but because windows is a GUI based OS it is generally easier to use something like rdesktop
[02:12] <gnosis> AegisX: ssh and samba
[02:12] <MK`> How do I get the Network section to "Refresh"?
=== peregrinator_six is now known as synaptic_siX
[02:13] <pfifo> Ben64, im afarid to edit /etc/shadow, are you sure?
[02:14] <Ben64> pfifo: yeah it's fine
[02:15] <pupy> hello
[02:15] <AegisX> Ah, thanks guys; thats a lot of good info. I'll go do some research!
[02:15] <pupy> what's the file used in ubuntu in replacement of boot/grub/menu.lst?
[02:15] <rww> !grub2
[02:15] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
[02:15] <pupy> I've got the problem that the windows partition doesn't boot from the menu
[02:16] <CCNY> Hello all, I have a ubuntu server that handles logins for a linux/unix lab.. my campus is moving towards a windows active directory based single-sign-on... is there a way I can get my server to ask the windows servers about user authentication, while still keeping control of the clients?
[02:16] <Oqm> why is wubi installing lucid desktop? O.o
[02:17] <brightspark> How can I remove old keyboard layouts from the menu that shows up when I click my picture at the login screen?
[02:18] <gnosis> CCNY: http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/40983 that may or may not help
[02:18] <AegisX> Oh, also; I can only connect to my Windows shared files by Alt + F2 then typing in the IP address of that machine. Is there any way to make the process easier? Automatically mount it, or anything like that?
[02:19] <oracle_vm> I'm running this command "dd if=/dev/sda |cpipe -vt| dd of=/dev/sdg" it shows the progress of the transfer.. I'm copying to a external usb drive and the speeds seems to be at 8-9MBps ... how can I get faster speeds since I'm copying 250Gb's?
[02:21] <mickster04> AegisX: places>network> ?
[02:21] <AegisX> mickster04: Doesn't work for me unless I do the Alt + F2 thing first
[02:21] <symptom> hello where is syndaemon start up located?
[02:21] <mickster04> oracle_vm: which usb is it? 1.1? 2? 3?
[02:21] <mickster04> AegisX: error messages?
[02:22] <gnosis> AegisX: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/configure-a-system-to-automount-a-samba-share-with-etcfstab/ may or may not help
[02:22] <mickster04> AegisX: you could add a startup script that does it?
[02:22] <AegisX> mickster04: Actually, scratch that. It doesn't work at all. Damn, I didn't read the error message.
[02:22] <swatto> ubuntu is screwed :( please help - my startup apps do not run and I cant start VLC - get socket_bind_error (permission denied) and no suitable interface
[02:22] <symptom> !syndaemon
[02:22] <mickster04> swatto: start up apps? and what about a different program?
[02:22] <AegisX> gnosis: Thanks, I'll try that.
[02:23] <AegisX> mickster04: I'm a complete newbie, really, so I'll take a look at scripting too. Thanks for the tip
[02:23] <Oqm> can the regular cd installation be installed for dual boot with windows as well or just the "windows install"
[02:23] <symptom> hello where is syndaemon start up located?
[02:23] <oracle_vm> mickster04: 2.0 1.5TB extrenal usb drive
[02:23] <CCNY> thanks everyone, have a good night
[02:23] <edbian> Oqm: regular install CDs can set up dual boot. Windows install is installing inside windows filesystem (wihtout partitioning)
[02:24] <swatto> mickster84: yep my startup apps dont run, i want Xchat to start on boot but it doesnt it just dont load and neither does any of my other user defined programs..bluetooth etc all load fine though? Other apps work, VLC did work but now it doesnt for some reason
[02:24] <Oqm> cheers edbian
[02:24] <mickster04> oracle_vm: what speeds are you expecting?
[02:24] <mickster04> swatto: curious, no idea, can you m anually start x-chat? what have you changed recently?
[02:26] <swatto> mickster84: yep i can manually start it - i havent changed anything as far as im aware, ive tried resetting the startup applications back to defaults but has made no difference, im wondering if it is a profile issue?
[02:26] <mickster04> !@tab | swatto
[02:26] <ubottu> swatto: You can use your <tab> key for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[02:27] <brightspark> How can I remove old keyboard layouts from the menu that shows up when I click my picture at the login screen?
[02:27] <mickster04> swatto: yeah i dunno...keep asking though...
[02:27] <swatto> ill make a new user and group to see if that solves it
[02:28] <oracle_vm> mickster04: 15-19MBps
[02:29] <mickster04> oracle_vm: is your port 2.0
[02:30] <oracle_vm> mickster04: yes
[02:30] <mickster04> oracle_vm: thee are several things that could be causing it.
[02:30] <mickster04> oracle_vm: an i dunno how to find out what might be the problem
[02:31] <gnosis> oracle_vm: are you transferring lots of small files?
[02:31] <obengdako> oracle_vm, i also believe the pipe is long so just use simple dd though you wont have the progress
[02:31] <oracle_vm> mickster04: somebody just told me it may be becuase it's a sector to sector copy of a drive that it's slower
[02:31] <obengdako> you can monitor file size
[02:31] <oracle_vm> gnosis: no
[02:32] <gnosis> ah, i just looked back at your orig command, nm
[02:32] <obengdako> yes that also account it is a raw copy
[02:32] <mickster04> oracle_vm: oh yeah, so it'll probably be doing lots of checks or whatever which won't help speed much
[02:32] <oracle_vm> obengdako: so raw copies are inherently slower?.. i wouldn;t have thought so for some reason
[02:33] <obengdako> nope they aren't because they are raw but i also was thinking your pipe | made the process too long
[02:34] <firered365> hello
[02:34] <lwizardl> how do i make it so I can compress iso disc images via right click menu ?
[02:34] <oracle_vm> obengdako: I've done dd with much smaller transfer like less than 10Gb ,, I would be antsy about anything larger without any indication of it's prgress
[02:35] <firered365> I need help installing linux on windows Me
[02:35] <obengdako> just a simple dd if=/dev of=/ would do but the piping for progress might slow it down
[02:35] <lwizardl> firered365, umm format the hdd to remove that horrible OS and then start the installer
[02:35] <gnosis> firered365: you're shitting me
[02:36] <firered365> Ok, How do I format the hdd
[02:36] <pfifo> Ben64, editing /etc/shadow created problems
[02:36] <lwizardl> firered365, can your computer boot from cd?
[02:36] <gnosis> firered365: do you seriously have windows ME?
[02:36] <firered365> I tried nothing.
[02:36] <lwizardl> or do you need a boot floppy
[02:37] <obengdako> oracle_vm, do you want to mainttain the file structure? is that why you are dd ing or just want to copy contents
[02:37] <firered365> It has a cd drive
[02:37] <lwizardl> firered365, ok put the cd in and reboot the computer does it boot the cd or go back into windows
[02:37] <aroman> hey, I'm in the laptop market and I'm wondering how Ubuntu/Linux handles systems with dual-graphics systems (i.e Intel HD 3000 and an AMD card in the same laptop). Thanks :)
[02:37] <disorient> i'm trying to launch pureftp with arguments, sudo service pure-ftp --trustedgid 1005 start, what is the right way to do this?
[02:37] <mickster04> firered365: first you go to ubuntu.com and read the instructions
[02:38] <gnosis> firered365: have you downloaded an ubuntu iso?
[02:38] <mickster04> firered365: have you turned your computer on?
[02:38] <firered365> it goes back to windows and yes
[02:38] <oracle_vm> obengdako: a windows hardrive I had messed up 2 years ago so I'm finally getting around to fixing/recovering the damaged partition.. I want to image it first
[02:38] <test> mickster04: Its swatto - im on a test account and its working fine now - can start VLC too
[02:38] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: if you stay away from nvidia you may be fine
[02:38] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: what do you mean?
[02:38] <mickster04> test: so your profiloe is kaput?
[02:38] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: for ati cards there may be a solution with open drivers (same with nvidia if you re lucky)
[02:38] <pfifo> how do i disable notifications, in fact how do i disable EVERYTHING that wants to automatically do anything without my explicitly typing a command on the command line
[02:38] <gnosis> firered365: have you backed up any files you want to keep?
[02:38] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: oh you mean opensource drivers, as opposed to using proprietary ones?
[02:38] <obengdako> okay okay then i guess you have to do the slow dd for 250GB oracle_vm  sorry
[02:39] <test> mickster04: yep looks like it, must have messed about so much thats something is screwed
[02:39] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: I was under the impression they offered inferior performance.
[02:39] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: you may want to have a read at "optimus" technology for nvidia and "switchable graphics" for ati
[02:39] <webroasters> hey guys. how can i get onto a mailing list that sends me an email every time a new release of ubuntu comes out? I've been looking all over for that
[02:39] <test> mickster04: at least its not an OS reinstall
[02:39] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: they may offer inferior performance but they re the only that let you switch
[02:39] <mickster04> aroman: then the easiest solution is to create a new user with admin privalidges and remove the old one imo
[02:39] <webroasters> i know 11.04 is coming soon, and I wanted to get an email when it was ready
[02:39] <firered365> Dont want to back up any files
[02:39] <oracle_vm> obengdako: next time i'll go for internal sata
[02:39] <aroman> mickster04: I think that was a misdirected ping :)
[02:39] <mickster04> webroasters: well just set an email to email you on the 28th?
[02:39] <SP_0taku> Hello I'm having an issue after updating from server 9.04 to 9.10 and have put the problem @ http://paste.ubuntu.com/594299/ thanks ahead for helping out :)
[02:40] <mickster04> aroman: yes ineed
[02:40] <webroasters> lol. funny
[02:40] <mickster04> aroman: i saw your nick and typed it :p
[02:40] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: dual card = integrated card for low demanding stuff, discrete card for high demanding
[02:40] <Ben64> webroasters: the schedule is very consistent
[02:40] <mickster04> test then the easiest solution is to create a new user with admin privalidges and remove the old one imo
[02:40] <gnosis> firered365: go into bios and set cd drive as first boot device
[02:40] <obengdako> oracle_vm, hehehe
[02:40] <webroasters> right i know
[02:40] <firered365> How do i do that
[02:40] <webroasters> but a newsletter or something would be nice
[02:40] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: The switching/optimus system lets the OS decide which card is best for the task at hand, right?
[02:40] <test> mickster04: I need to get some stuff from Home directory though
[02:40] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: like per-application, I thought.
[02:40] <mickster04> webroasters: a newsletter saying what?
[02:40] <gnosis> firered365: reboot, it should say how to go into setup, usually F1 or delete
[02:41] <SP_0taku> issue is with booting.
[02:41] <webroasters> nevermind
[02:41] <mickster04> test: copy /home/user /home/newuser
[02:41] <webroasters> thanks guys
[02:41] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: nvidia offers NO support for linux (only open drivers do)  ati offers open drivers which may in a future (not a far one i suppose) work with linux , if you buy a so called dual card equipped laptop it will have that technology and if you have a nvidia you will only use the intel/amd integrated card (not sure amd has a gma-like product)
[02:41] <firered365> it doesnt say
[02:41] <gnosis> firered365: without knowing your bios i can't give exact instructions, but look for boot menu, boot order, soemthing like that
[02:41] <firered365> Ok what is BIOS
[02:41] <milind> i am trying to change the primary display in ubuntu 10.10 to my external gateway 23 inch monitor. I have a ati radeon hd 6250 graphics card and the ati catalyst does not have an option to choose which display to put as my primary display. What should i do?
[02:41] <test> mickster04: how can i create the swatto account again
[02:42] <pupy> can somebody help me? why wouldn't ubuntu boot windows xp in /dev/sda1?
[02:42] <gnosis> firered365: are you doing this on another comp right now?
[02:42] <firered365> yes
[02:42] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: simple example, you boot up your windows system and open paint, here you re using the integrated card, then you get bored and wanna play lets say crysis? it automatically turns on the discrete one, on linux this isnt widely supported yet, and won't be (seems so) from nvidia anyways
[02:42] <pupy> all I get is a cursor blinking
[02:42] <oracle_vm> obengdako: I just checked the chart on wikipedia for usb,sata and thunderbolt transfer speeds.. i for one can;t wait for thunderbolt in everything..
[02:42] <pupy> well ubuntu...grub2
[02:42] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: In that situation, is there any dual combo that would work with Linux?
[02:43] <gnosis> firered365: when you turn on the computer, before getting to windows, it should show something like "press F1 to enter setup"
[02:43] <milind> i am trying to change the primary display in ubuntu 10.10 to my external gateway 23 inch monitor. I have a ati radeon hd 6250 graphics card and the ati catalyst does not have an option to choose which display to put as my primary display. What should i do?
[02:43] <aroman> Like I'm browsing the web, and then I want to play Nexuiz or something.
[02:43] <firered365> it doesnt say
[02:43] <obengdako> oracle_vm, really i got to check this thunderbolt out myself
[02:43] <firered365> press F1 to start
[02:43] <oracle_vm> obengdako: thunderbolt is 1,250MBps transfer speed..
[02:43] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: nexuiz should work with gma i think, in the last years i been using only those lol
[02:43] <gnosis> firered365: try just continually pressing F1, F2, and delete while it's booting then
[02:43] <oracle_vm> obengdako: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA#Comparison_to_other_buses
[02:43] <gnosis> it should go into a very old looking menu screen
[02:43] <firered365> Ok thanks
[02:44] <obengdako> oracle_vm, gosh that is quite fast i mean really fast
[02:44] <l3aked4uftw> aroman:  i dont get your first statement, are you buying a laptop or you sell them?
[02:44] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: I'm buying :)
[02:45] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: in that case may i ask you what you want to do with it?
[02:45] <aroman> and I only have use for Linux, so I want to make sure the hardware works as cleanly as possible with it.
[02:45] <milind> i am trying to change the primary display in ubuntu 10.10 to my external gateway 23 inch monitor. I have a ati radeon hd 6250 graphics card and the ati catalyst does not have an option to choose which display to put as my primary display. What should i do?
[02:45] <mickster04> gnosis: you have patience :D
[02:45] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: coding and schoolwork.
[02:46] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: most gma (except 950 or 500 i forgot which one, but very old one) work out of the box with latest versions of ubuntu, nothing required
[02:46] <pfifo> how can I spin down my SSD drive to save power?
[02:46] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: that means no heavy gaming or uber-hd video in flash or some cpu killer plugin?
[02:46] <aroman> pfifo: LOL
[02:46] <pfifo> aroman, S.M.A.R.T. is trolling me
[02:46] <gnosis> mickster04: i'm in shock.  can't believe someone still has a computer with winME
[02:46] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: I'm sure i'll be using Flash, and I'd like to be able to play 1080p video and stuff
[02:47] <aroman> i"m not looking to do video editing or playing serious games on it
[02:47] <dotblank> One time I was like.. WinME is so old.. it will run so fast on my computer...
[02:47] <mickster04> pfifo: you're funny :D
[02:47] <aroman> pfifo: haha
[02:47] <dotblank> couldn't be more wrong
[02:47] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: if you like i may hint you with something, like model what to search and so on
[02:47] <mickster04> gnosis: i wonder how he heard of ubuntu? telegram?
[02:47] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: sure

[02:48] <Jetpack> Hey, I'm looking for a new laptop that will work well on Ubuntu, but also have a decent graphics card, for under $1000, anyone have any suggestions?
[02:49] <dotblank> Jetpack, I think ubuntu keeps a list of certified hardware

[02:49] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: I'd really like it to be no more expensive than $1000. I don't particularly care about brands so long as it's reliable and trustworthy.
[02:49] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: you live in the usa?
[02:49] <aroman> yes
[02:50] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: dell is supposed to be the only that sells you their repair guy , want to start with them?

[02:51] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: sure I guess
[02:51] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: i said that because you said "reliable and trustworthy" lol

[02:53] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: differences      "enterprise" the tech will even kiss ur feet     "home" he'll go "you re a home user u suck" but will fix ur pc
[02:53] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: okie dokie on it
[02:53] <pfifo> hi Dr_Willis nice to see you again
[02:54] <ShapeShifter499> mickster04, oh ok
[02:55] <Dr_Willis> Jetpack:  http://www.notebookcheck.net
[02:55] <Dr_Willis> Jetpack:  to be honest with you - I dont see the point for most people tio get a 1000$ laptop. Unless you need a 'gaming laptop'
[02:55] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: omg in the usa configuration is different, give me a minute please :D
[02:56] <Jetpack> Dr_Willis: I was mainly just specifying a price range, I'll take nearly anything that's not an integrated card
[02:56] <a3Deb> how do i make a script that will link to a directory?
[02:56] <Dr_Willis> Jetpack:  i got the laptop thta had the highest class nvidia card, that just happened to be in my range. on sale :)
[02:57] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: ok i highly suggest we go for arrandale processors (old gen) which are supposed to be working rather than sandy bridge which may be fairly new and untested, is that fine?
[02:57] <a3Deb> i want it to double click and bam, there's the directory
[02:57] <SP_0taku> My issue was most likely the Grub.conf not matching the new kernel
[02:57] <Dr_Willis> Jetpack:  http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GT-335M.24060.0.html    See tje 'class 1' list at the right side. I just looked at that list when shopping.
[02:57] <SP_0taku> Bye Bye ^_^
[02:58] <ShapeShifter499> mickster04, nietoyface omg yay... I just tried to mount via live cd and it mounted
[02:58] <mickster04> ShapeShifter499: copy and paste :D
[02:58] <Dr_Willis> Jetpack:  one Nice feature about the laptop i got was it had 2 Hard drives. :) One for Linux, one for windows.
[02:58] <Dr_Willis> bbl ya all.
[02:58] <a3Deb> anyone know how to make scripts/
[02:58] <gnosis> a3Deb: that's not very clear.  can you explain what you want it to do?
[02:59] <a3Deb> i want it to open a window to a director
[02:59] <camelot> yeah ubottu i did exactly to the T what wine help section on fallout 3 told me to do, and nothing! it keeps saying no cdrom found.
[02:59] <Jetpack> Dr_Willis, thanks. :D
[02:59] <a3Deb> directory*
[02:59] <ShapeShifter499> mickster04, hey if I can mount... why can't I boot into it??
[02:59] <mickster04> camelot: ubottu is a bot,
[02:59] <mickster04> ShapeShifter499: you broke the mbr
[02:59] <gnosis> a3Deb: so you just want a shortcut to a directory?
[02:59] <a3Deb> yeah
[03:00] <mickster04> ShapeShifter499: you can try and fix it using a recorevy
[03:00] <ShapeShifter499> mickster04, no I still run grub
[03:00] <a3Deb> shortcut with a custom icon
[03:00] <camelot> oh
[03:00] <mickster04> ShapeShifter499: well maybe the kernel is broken
[03:00] <camelot> jokes on me
[03:00] <gnosis> a3Deb: right click, make link
[03:00] <mickster04> ShapeShifter499: it could be many thing
[03:00] <mickster04> s
[03:00] <camelot> nyways
[03:00] <mickster04> ShapeShifter499: eitherway back up then try to boot again
[03:00] <mickster04> then try a fix
[03:00] <ShapeShifter499> mickster04, I was resizing the affected patition when the live cd crashed before grub did its thing
[03:00] <ShapeShifter499> ok
[03:01] <mickster04> ShapeShifter499: oh well, you can try doing the fix grub thing in !grub
[03:01] <mickster04> !grub | ShapeShifter499
[03:01] <ubottu> ShapeShifter499: grub is the default boot manager for Ubuntu releases before 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - GRUB how-tos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto - See !grub2 for Karmic onwards.
[03:01] <mickster04> ShapeShifter499: that restoregrub link is the one you want
[03:01] <ShapeShifter499> mickster04, sorry ment to say gparted *facepalm*
[03:01] <UbuntuN00b> anyone have some time to help a n00b with a grub problem
[03:01] <camelot> i give in...windows it is. thx! blah!
[03:02] <l3aked4uftw> UbuntuN00b: what kind of problem?
[03:02] <MK`> How do I get the Network section to "Refresh"? It's not updating after I changed stuff on computers on the network, even though direct connection works
[03:02] <like> hi
[03:02] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: hey, sorry about that
[03:02] <UbuntuN00b> installed windows xp (internal harddrive) install ubuntu (netbook remix) (on SD) grub didn't load after install went strait to windows
[03:03] <gnosis> MK`: what's not showing up?
[03:03] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: errrrrrrr i closed the page gotta reopen now lol
[03:03] <l3aked4uftw> UbuntuN00b: i think you have to install grub on hd too, better wait for someone more experienced than me
[03:03] <MK`> gnosis: When I click on the network, the computers do not show up. The printer connected to one of the computers works fine from here, though
[03:03] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: you there?
[03:03] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: haha sorry
[03:04] <gnosis> UbuntuN00b: try switching boot order in bios?
[03:04] <UbuntuN00b> can't acer aspire doesn't find sd card (as its pci internally not usb)
[03:04] <l3aked4uftw> gnosis: lol, judging the time here and my brain's conditions i would have NEVER thought of that, good one :)
[03:04] <mickster04> UbuntuN00b: then you have to install grub on the first hdd
[03:05] <gnosis> UbuntuN00b: ohhh, i thought you meant you had an ssd
[03:05] <gnosis> UbuntuN00b: you have a card reader or something?
[03:05] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: you know what turbo boost is?
[03:06] <mickster04> UbuntuN00b: the manual will say if you can boot from the SD card?
[03:06] <UbuntuN00b> i bought a usb one... didn't come up in bios (waster of $12)
[03:06] <mickster04> UbuntuN00b: what boot ptions do you get in the bios
[03:06] <UbuntuN00b> can't book from SD card  from bios....but with grub your suppose to be able to
[03:06] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: yep
[03:06] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: you have it as a priority?
[03:07] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: not really
[03:07] <gnosis> l3aked4uftw: turbo boost: http://cultoupop.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/GilletteMach3TurboCartridges.jpg
[03:07] <mickster04> UbuntuN00b: it is nothing to do with grub, if your bios won't let you you can't? alternatively try installing grub on the main hdd, it should work fine
[03:07] <UbuntuN00b> ok is their a native windows install, or do i have to make a bootable usb?
[03:07] <l3aked4uftw> gnosis: i know what it is i was helping aroman pick up a notebook lol
[03:07] <l3aked4uftw> gnosis: thanks though
[03:07] <teage> where would the menu settings be saved? I have it set up the way i like and would like to be able to save my settings case something goes wrong.

[03:09] <mickster04> teage: they well be in hidden folders etc?
[03:09] <aroman> l3aked4uftw: yeah let's see it ;)
[03:09] <l3aked4uftw> aroman: omfg this connection is slow brb
[03:10] <l3aked4uftw> ops sorry for the rudeness
[03:10] <gnosis> aroman: looking for a laptop?
[03:10] <Technicus> Hello . . . is it possible to display blinking text with Gnome Terminal?
[03:11] <aroman> gnosis: yep
[03:11] <mickster04> teage: for why?
[03:11] <mickster04> Technicus: for why?
[03:11] <mickster04> Technicus: sorry
[03:11] <mickster04> teage: sorry
[03:11] <teage> mickster04 , would it be in .local do you think. im not sure what exactly im looking for
[03:11] <mickster04> -_-
[03:11] <FloodBot1> mickster04: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:11] <mickster04> teage: me neither
[03:11] <Technicus> For because it is not and I want it to.
[03:12] <teage> because i have edited my applications menu and i would like to back it up
[03:12] <l3aked4uftw2> aroman: im on a 2mb connection my 3g stick is supposed to be 14  yet my old slow modem pwnt the stick, and btw its me, it didnt log the other off freenode lol
[03:13] <l3aked4uftw2> aroman: how long would you like the warranty to last?
[03:13] <MK`> gnosis: When I click on the network, the computers do not show up. The printer connected to one of the computers works fine from here, though
[03:13] <aroman> l3aked4uftw2: damn
[03:13] <mickster04> !restoregrub | UbuntuN00b
[03:13] <aroman> l3aked4uftw2: don't care
[03:13] <gnosis> Technicus: most modern terminals don't support blinking.  thankfully
[03:13] <l3aked4uftw2> aroman: even if its 1 year collect n return is it fine for u?
[03:13] <teage> mickster04 , I believe its in .local because i just found my .desktop launchers i have created. Think im on the right track
[03:13] <UbuntuN00b> !grub
[03:13] <ubottu> grub is the default boot manager for Ubuntu releases before 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - GRUB how-tos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto - See !grub2 for Karmic onwards.
[03:13] <Technicus> gnosis: konsole supports blinking.
[03:13] <mickster04> teage: awesome
[03:13] <aroman> l3aked4uftw2: yeah
[03:14] <ender> Hi folks, I'm having a problem here getting sound to work, have looked in the forums for a while and thought to ask if anyone can give me a hand. I'm running Xubuntu 10.10 and alsa seems to be working fine. My onboard SiS 97 (7012) is listed and I can even mute and unmute channels in alsamixer
[03:14] <l3aked4uftw2> aroman: o great, unlike me you dont waste your money on warranty =P
[03:14] <aroman> :P
[03:14] <gnosis> MK`: dunno, sorry
[03:15] <mickster04> ender: so are your speakers plugged in and turned on /up?
[03:15] <l3aked4uftw2> aroman: never using windows?
[03:15] <aroman> l3aked4uftw2: yeah I dont intend to run it
[03:15] <ender> mickster04: yeah... =)
[03:16] <oscargot>  ]
[03:16] <ender> mickster04: the icon in the gui mixer shows dots after the speaker, as if it's muted or unplugged, but the master channel (actually all channels) are not muted.
[03:16] <mickster04> ender: no sounds at all?
[03:16] <UbuntuN00b> !grub > me
[03:16] <ubottu> UbuntuN00b, please see my private message
[03:16] <l3aked4uftw2> aroman: one is this http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?oc=fncor05&c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19&model_id=inspiron-15r-combo-mod  tweak it if you like while i see a sandy bridge one (wider choice, mind you im not sure sb will work)
[03:17] <ender> mickster04: Also, It was working fine under an Ubuntu live I ran earlier.
[03:17] <rcconf> back
[03:17] <l3aked4uftw2> aroman: 3gb ram should be plenty, if you want you can tweak something , let me know
[03:17] <mickster04> ender: ... -_- no idea then
[03:17] <gnosis> l3aked4uftw2: dell has gone to shit the last few years
[03:17] <radhruin> I transfered my boot drive to completely different computer and now I can't get ubuntu to boot (it's a natty install). Dmesg/kern log shows nothing in particular. New compy has different graphics hardware (AMD not nVidia) so I purged nvidia-* but still no luck booting. Any ideas?
