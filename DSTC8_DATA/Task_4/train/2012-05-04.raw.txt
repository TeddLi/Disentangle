[00:21] <Jordan_U> Djeff-o: Can you pastebin the output of "dmesg"?
[00:21] <Praxi> Zopiac_, I installed it from source on a fresh server, the package in the repositories wasn't very useful
[00:21] <ichat> whoooot
[00:21] <phaidros> BrokenCog: on temrinal do "sudo apt-get install -f" and afterwards "sudo do-release-update" if that doesn help "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" depending on the state of the update one might work
[00:21] <doki_pen> iceroot: i've done that, I haven't edited sources.list
[00:22] <iceroot> doki_pen: i dont know what mirror.rackspace.com is, try to use the real repos
[00:22] <ichat> phaidros - i may have fixed it

[00:22] <ubottu> ichat: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[00:22] <phaidros> ichat: well, not a solution, but a login screnn tho :)
[00:23] <doki_pen> iceroot: right.. that is what rackspace has on their default ubuntu image.  I Just realized that..
[00:23] <BrokenCog> phaidros thanks, I'll try it now.
[00:25] <BrokenCog> phaidros so it returned that bpkg --configure -r was needed ... looks like it's getting back on track.  thanks for the tip.  I need to learn this apt-get system ... Slackware has something a bit different.
[00:25] <phaidros> BrokenCog: apt-get is nice, aptitude even more handy sometimes .. and *very* convenient compared to slack ;)

[00:26] <taxman> aptitude is obsolete on 12.04. i have tested it
[00:27] <iceroot> taxman: aptitude is still the better tool from both
[00:27] <taxman> there is no gnome classic on 12.04 either
[00:27] <phaidros> BrokenCog: what actually happend, is that apt realized that the underlying tool (dpkg) wasnt finished in some state and told ya the right command to let dpkg finish its current job. afterwards run that apt command again, as not all dpkg jobs might have been queeued yet
[00:27] <xangua> !nounity | taxman
[00:27] <ubottu> taxman: Ubuntu 11.10 uses GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[00:27] <phaidros> taxman: well, really? my aptitude works as always

[00:27] <ubottu> SELinux is available on Ubuntu, but not officially supported. Ubuntu uses another security framework by default, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor
[00:27] <xangua> taxman: that it's not preinstalled doesn't mean obsoloete
[00:28] <iceroot> taxman: there are some tools which are better then the default but they are not installed by default (gimp, vim, zsh, aptitude)
[00:28] <iceroot> taxman: mostly because of disc-space by the iso
[00:28] <phaidros> ichat: I dont agree on vim and zsh!
[00:29] <phaidros> iceroot: ^^
[00:29] <iceroot> phaidros: vim is better then vi of course
[00:29] <phaidros> vim is a sickness ...

[00:29] <iceroot> phaidros: compared to vi

[00:34] <aardmark> for anyone out there that has encountered this issue: I've been having a tough time figuring out how to transfer ~100GB of data from my Mac to my Ubuntu box, and coming across several lame issues. Best resolution: direct ethernet link between the Mac and the Ubuntu box, and I'm able to transfer roughly 1GB per minute
[00:35] <aardmark> could probably go even faster if I wasn't using SCP, but hey - this is much less painful than shuttling a thumbdrive
[00:35] <taxman> mac has thunderbolt
[00:35] <tarwich> aardmark: Why didn't you boot into Target Disk Mode and read from that? Was it slower? (might have been, not sure)
[00:36] <aardmark> using target disk mode over ethernet with ubuntu
[00:36] <aardmark> ?
[00:36] <aardmark> taxman: my mac doesn't have thunderbolt
[00:37] <taxman> O.o
[00:37] <tarwich> Negative. Mac has a mode called target disk mode where the mac functions as a glorified USB stick — allowing you to copy to and from it by plugging it into a usb or firewire port.
[00:37] <tarwich> aardmark: Sorry, I should have used your name! :-|
[00:38] <aardmark> tarwich: oo mount the drive over USB in target mode... that'd have been interesting - I thought it only worked over firewire
[00:38] <aardmark> tarwich: I'll have to try that
[00:38] <tarwich> aardmark: checking...
[00:38] <ztag100> tarwich, Is there a way to do that with ubuntu?
[00:38] <aardmark> tarwich: that'd have probably been faster because SCP does the encryption with the transfer
[00:39] <tarwich> ztag100: negative. It's a mac bios thing.
[00:39] <taxman> mac has no bios
[00:39] <tarwich> taxman:  LOL… Let's not get into wars over technicalities on something off-topic.
[00:39] <ztag100> It would be cool
[00:40] <tarwich> aardmark: TDM does not work with USB http://osxdaily.com/2010/04/07/how-to-boot-a-mac-in-target-disk-mode/
[00:40] <aardmark> taxman: btw - Mac is built off of Unix, which has BIOS.
[00:41] <aardmark> tarwich: ahh - ok... woulda been cool tho
[00:41] <aardmark> well.. I guess as of 2010 (when the article was posted)
[00:41] <ztag100> Isn't BIOS seperate from OS?
[00:42] <taxman> !@#$#$%^&&*
[00:43] <tarwich> BIOS is the basic input output system that is used to coordinate between your things like a keyboard and the operating system. All computers have a BIOS, but some people think of BIOS is the user-friendly screens that come up on a PC

[01:01] <SyphirX> I did the standard install but once it restarted, the second monitor just wasnt being detected

[01:09] <walbert> SyphirX: try gksudo gedit /var/log/Xorg.0.log from the Terminal (bash).  To get to bash, hit your meta key, and start typing "terminal"
[01:09] <Xeneth> tucemiux_mob, The main reason I think for the extra time is because it's a script in the gnome/unity that is doing it, so that must first load.  If you enter the configurations in the network file, that may speed things up.
[01:10] <wylde> SyphirX: or if you're in a gui you can just ctrl+alt+t to open the terminal.

[01:29] <tucemiux> ejv, sorry but im more into ubuntu, what works on ubuntu and the like
[01:29] <josten> I have had a lot of questions answered on here.  What is going on now?
[01:29] <tucemiux> how do you search the software center?
[01:30] <LinuxMonkey> josten still answering questions and asking some too
[01:30] <ejv> yea i get that, i wanted your opinion on the other fps's that happen to run on ubuntu, if you have experience in that realm that is; if you change your mind: -> #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:30] <josten> LinuxMonkey: Sorry.  Thanks.
[01:31] <LinuxMonkey> tucemiux:  search bar in the top right hand corner (white rectangle with a magnefying glass)
[01:32] <tucemiux> LinuxMonkey, thanks, i had to maximize the screen to see it
[01:32] <josten> Didn't know if I was connected or not.  Sorry.
[01:32] <tucemiux> thats a big flaw, if you make the software center smaller, you dont have a horizontal bar
[01:33] <josten> LinuxMonkey: be back in a few
[01:33] <wylde> tucemiux: in the software center?
[01:33] <tucemiux> anyone knows if it's possible to install themes in ubuntu?
[01:34] <ulkesh> The software center seems to have a min res, around 640x480 or so...everything repositions well for me...at least in 12.04.
[01:34] <tucemiux> wylde, yeah i made the window smaller and couldnt see the search square, i didnt have a horizontal bar
[01:34] <wylde> tucemiux: the only somewhat stable way I've found so far is using ubuntu-tweak
[01:34] <tucemiux> what's ubuntu-tweak? what does that thing do?
[01:34] <monvillalon> IM looking for way to add a repo, but only use it for cherry picked packages…. I can't seem to google fu it

[01:35] <wylde> tucemiux: http://ubuntu-tweak.com/ their project is hosted in Launchpad as well.
[01:36] <tucemiux> wylde, ok but im wondering what does ubuntu tweak has?
[01:36] <chsados> can anyone help me... first time ubuntu user: installed ubuntu 12.04 onto my 2nd HDD on my computer (D:) have win7 installed on C:  i used the webui.exe to install ubuntu onto D: and when i restart i get the option to select windows or ubunty - i select ubuntu and it tells me im missing files or something.... i can get a screen shot if this isnt making any sense
[01:37] <wylde> tucemiux: it lets you use themes you can find in the repos.
[01:37] <monvillalon> chsados: I've nerves heard of webui.exe do you mean Wubi?
[01:38] <chsados> i assume so.. its the small file you download from the website that downloads ubuntu and installs it through windows
[01:38] <tucemiux> wylde, thanks im goign to look into it but for now im going to fix my video drivers
[01:38] <wylde> tucemiux: alrighty.
[01:38] <Jordan_U> chsados: I would recommend that you uninstall Wubi and install Ubuntu in a normal dual boot.
[01:39] <Mauhdeeb> Having a weird problem opening Windows share that wasn't present on 11.10. Keeps asking for the username and password but if I enter them it says "opening" and eventually falls back to asking again
[01:39] <chsados> im thinking the problem is im not installing it on the C drive
[01:39] <wylde> +1 on Jordan_U 's recommendation.
[01:39] <Mauhdeeb> Anyone seen this behavior?
[01:40] <chsados> i dont want to install it on C: bc i am going to format C and reinstall windows after i get ubuntu functional i want ubuntu on my D drive and windows on my C
[01:40] <conkyhelp> i just installed conky. im trying to use a some conky scripts (conkytransmission), but i dont see a .conkyrc file after install and reboot. does anyone know how to customize conky?
[01:41] <Jordan_U> chsados: First, remove Wubi using Add/Remove programs from Windows.
[01:41] <chsados> ok
[01:41] <chsados> i guess reformat D again?
[01:41] <wylde> conkyhelp: are you enabling show hidden files?
[01:41] <monvillalon> chsados: Wubi , creates a virtual disk , its not a "real" ubuntu installation as I understand it.  Its tied to Windows because it lives inside a Windows file, its a weird thing that I don't recoment
[01:41] <conkyhelp> wylde: ls -al, yes
[01:41] <chsados> ahhh i see monvillalon
[01:41] <monvillalon> chsados: Install from scratch
[01:42] <chsados> problem is i dont have cd/dvd drive on comp and my thumb drive is in a friends hand (gave her first 2 seasons of game of thrones :D)
[01:42] <wylde> conkyhelp: alrighty, just checking :)
[01:42] <chsados> so i currently have no way of installing it via iso
=== decaf is now known as Guest71519
[01:42]  * taxman has a dozen of fast pendrives for ubuntu
[01:43] <monvillalon> chsados: As Jordan_U said , remove with windows installer, get a dvd, reboot computer with dvd inside, install.  Btw if you are not versed in the ways of the multi boot create a backup :)
[01:43] <Jordan_U> chsados: Do you absolutely need to install it now, or can you wait until you have a blank CD or a flash drive?
[01:43] <chsados> i can wait.... if i must
=== Guest71519 is now known as decaf
[01:44] <Jordan_U> chsados: Then I recommend you just wait.
[01:44] <chsados> i wont have any internet connectivity until my cat6 cable comes from ebay anyways... ubuntu doesnt like my netgear wireless dongle
[01:44] <monvillalon> chsados: I see no other way, there is a network install but its not worth the trouble
[01:44] <ulkesh> chsados, I would suggest VirtualBox as an option as well, depending on what you're trying to do (if you're just trying out Ubuntu, it can be a good way to go if you have enough RAM)
[01:44] <monvillalon> chsados: ulkesh idea is great if you just want to try it out
[01:45] <chsados> i just want ubuntu for secure browsing/usage CISPA got me all pissy

[01:56] <Fyodorovna> usa, gnome 2 is not in 12.04 there is a fallback gnome that looks somewhat and can be tweaked to be close to it. run sudo apt-get install gnome-shell and you will also get the gnome 3 desktop as a choice as well.
=== root is now known as Guest73254
[01:56] <wylde> conkyhelp: alright, then I should assume you installed transmission-cli and edited the preferences there.... according to the instructions, install.sh should create the sample .conkyrc for you, so it isn't then?
[01:57] <thoong> can i change color scheme in ubuntu - say instead of orange highlight to blue highlight. blue seems to be choice for many os.

[02:30] <yugnip> joen plop instruction http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-from-usb-without-bios-support-via-plop-cd/
[02:30] <iHarp> LinuxMonkey: Any idea after what I posted up there? ^^
[02:30] <Joen> Thanks, I'll try plop and then see if I have any CDs or USBs that are small enough for the small image.
[02:31] <yugnip> i believe with plop you can also use a floppy?
[02:31] <Jordan_U> Joen: I would definitely go with the minimal install image rather than trying to mess with plop (in fact I'm not sure how plop is a solution at all).
[02:31] <LinuxMonkey> iharp thats very odd, ive never come across that
[02:31] <Joen> Ok.
[02:32] <blocky> what does it mean when booting the livecd says Can not mount /dev/loop1 on /cow
[02:32] <Jordan_U> Joen: Make sure to also remove Wubi through Add/Remove programs in Windows.
[02:32] <Joen> I don't have Wubi.
[02:32] <Jordan_U> Joen: "The setup said it could boot without a CD by configuring the boot or something." That's wubi.
[02:32] <iHarp> Anyone know why a freshly installed game would send me to ubuntu software center without prompting me to download anything?
[02:33] <Joen> But I didn't install anything. I just mounted the iso image.
[02:33] <iHarp> Game = Savage XR
[02:33] <wylde> Jordan_U: he was attempting to install from a mounted iso.
[02:33] <yugnip> Jordan_U: i must have misunderstood, i assumed the issue was unable to boot from usb
[02:33] <Jordan_U> yugnip: No, the issue is that his USB drive is not large enough for the normal Ubuntu image.
[02:34] <Joen> Actually, I am unable to find mine.
[02:34] <Joen> I can buy one tomorrow if it's necessary, but I'd just prefer to get it going to tonight without it if possible. So now I'm going to look for a CD.
[02:34] <Guest135> re my previous question anything i can run on putty to see what mode (pio, udma6 etc etc) an attached usb drive is in? id usually use hdparm for this but it's not liking working on an external hdd.
[02:34] <wylde> Joen: for the minimal you only need 30MB :)
[02:35] <Joen> Would an external hard drive work?
[02:35] <Joen> Through USB
[02:35] <Jordan_U> Joen: Yes.
[02:35] <blocky> how reliable is Install ubuntu alongside widows 7
[02:35] <blocky> I just clicked it thinking it would allow me to review the partitioning changes...
[02:36] <Jordan_U> Joen: It's easier to configure if the drive uses fat32. With an external drive that's large enough I would definitely go with the normal rather than minimal install image.
[02:36] <iHarp> blocky: I do it. I've had relatively no issues.
[02:36] <blocky> relatively no :P
[02:36] <Joen> Can the filesystem of the hard drive be messed up if I use it?
[02:37] <Jordan_U> Joen: Instructions here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows
[02:37] <Joen> Thanks
[02:37] <wylde> blocky: I have no issues....but then I haven't used windows for almost a year now :)
[02:37] <Jordan_U> Joen: Not unless you select an explicit option to wipe the drive, which would be very difficult to do accidentily.
[02:37] <iHarp> blocky: Standard issues such as finding the right drivers and such, but that has notthing to do with windows
[02:37] <oscar76> hi! anybody knows  where to find instructions to  instal ubuntu on a tablet?
[02:37] <hailey> I'm unable to figure out what to do with this BCM4311 wireless NIC.

[02:38] <LinuxMonkey> Lol ive installed it alongside windows 7 2 weeks ago with no issues, today I formated the drive and installed ubuntu over the entire disk :)
[02:38] <wylde> LinuxMonkey: +1

[02:39] <iHarp> gotcha
[02:39] <rinzler> does anyone know of a way to incite the distribution update from terminal? for the 11.10 update, my vps told me a command that would upgrade the distro automatically, but I don't know how to make it see the update. I only have ssh access...
[02:39] <blocky> I ran the installer, not the livecd
[02:39] <blocky> livecd gave me an error about /cow
[02:39] <wylde> rinzler: do-release-upgrade?
[02:39] <LinuxMonkey> wylde only issue I have is the complaint of Unknown LVM metadata headers but its just a bug
[02:39] <iHarp> I prefer the manual approach.
[02:40] <rinzler> wylde: command not found
[02:40] <wylde> LinuxMonkey: yeah, you reported it I hope? Or at least added extra info if you could? :)
[02:40] <iHarp> Setup windows with minimal resources. Add 6G of swap space for my 4G of ram. And the rest of my drive goes to ubuntu
[02:40] <blocky> can I import thunderbird emails from windows?
[02:41] <iHarp> edit* 100G  goes to my free FAT space
[02:41] <LinuxMonkey> wylde its allready reported on a major scale.lol
[02:41] <tohuw> When invoking ftp from the CLI, how can I get all files in a given folder?
[02:41] <oscar76> iHarp: 6G of swap !  wish I had 6G to spend !
[02:41] <wylde> LinuxMonkey: alrighty, just making sure :)
[02:41] <aaas> blocky do you have imap or pop?
[02:41] <hailey> I'm unable to figure out what to do with this BCM4311 wireless NIC with  3.2.0-24-generic  kernel.  Any advise?
[02:41] <hilikus> how can i change the permission on a drive that is automounted. it is in /media/foo and its owned by my user but i need to either change the owner or give go+r. just doing chmod or chown doesn't work for some reason
[02:42] <wylde> rinzler: you're upgradin TO 11.10 or FROM 11.10?
[02:42] <aaas> hilikus i think you need to change the options in /etc/fstab
[02:42] <hilikus> aaas: its not in fstab, its a removable drive that's automounted
[02:42] <rinzler> wylde: FROM. I was citing my upgrade TO in my original question.
[02:42] <blocky> aaas, pop but nvm that
[02:43] <blocky> I have Unable to install GRUB in /dev/mapper
[02:43] <shawn_> hi,do you guy use ubuntu 64bit or 32bit?
[02:43] <napalm54> Hey all, For QT Creator is it best to install through the Ubuntu software center or from debian package from the official website?
[02:43] <taxman> 64 bit
[02:43] <blocky> Executing 'grub-install /dev/mapper' failed. This is a fatal error.
[02:43] <iHarp> oscar76: How much ram and hard drive space do you have
[02:43] <aaas> hilikus ok then you have to check the udev stuff...umm /etc/defaults/udev.... i cant remember where the file is
[02:43] <bandit5432> depends on the laptop its 32 on the desktop its 64
[02:43] <tohuw> !best | napalm54
[02:43] <ubottu> napalm54: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[02:43] <k_sze> What's the best utility to simulate low bandwidth and/or high latency network connection on (X)ubuntu? I don't mind command line.
[02:43] <wylde> rinzler: ok thanks, just wanted to be clear is all :)
[02:43] <shawn_> is 64bit better for AMD64 CPU
[02:43] <taxman> but it's a fusion of 64- and 32- bit for 12.04
[02:44] <tohuw> napalm54: sorry, wrong factoid. Your answer is: it depends on what you are looking for.
[02:44] <taxman> look at mtrr, it's set up for 32-bit
[02:44] <shawn_> TO taxman  : thank you
[02:44] <bandit5432> my laptop only supports 32bit and i have 12.04 installed
[02:44] <aaas> blocky well the profile should be universal (I think) so if you point it to yoru profile it shoudl be able to read your mailbox
[02:44] <taxman> inside 4gb of space
[02:44] <k_sze> I want to simulate high latency between my LAN and my Xubuntu box.
[02:44] <taxman> 12.04 is not like a pathetic 64-bit linux
[02:44] <napalm54> tohuw: I guess I am wondering if there are any drawbacks to using the ubuntu software center vs .deb from the official website
[02:44] <blocky> aaas, thanks, I'll try that once I figure out why grub has failed
[02:44] <aaas> blocky is there an "import" feature in thunderbird
[02:44] <wanna> I just installed 12.4 and can't get my wireless connection working on my laptop. Got any sugestions?
[02:45] <agu10^> ubuntu is like worse than web OS !
[02:45] <OerHeks> taxman, it is, 64 bit is multi-arch
[02:45] <oscar76> iHarp: I only have 512M and 2G free disk.  I have to stop using Transmission ;)
[02:45] <rinzler> getting: "mosh : Depends: libprotobuf5 but it is not installable" how do I correct this?
[02:45] <blocky> why would it be installing grub to /dev/mapper, what is /dev/mapper?
[02:45] <taxman> iirc, it's debian's multi-lib like solution
=== Guest86184 is now known as Bogdaniel
[02:46] <blocky> it's asking me to choose a different device to install the bootloader on
[02:46] <taxman> OerHeks, i prefer to use a pure 64-bit linux, just my taste
[02:46] <oscar76> iHarp: I was just wandering if 6G for swap is a little too much
[02:46] <tohuw> napalm54: In general, using distribution-specific packages mean it has been compiled and tested on that distribution. It also often (but not always) means the package is not the latest release. Typically, you are trading bleeding-edge for tested compatibility. Examine the versions, check the project's official documentation and the distribution's provided documentation (if any), decide.
=== Bogdaniel is now known as Guest26432
[02:46] <shawn_> taxman: I just can't make a decision  to migrate from 32bit to 64bit.....
[02:47] <taxman> shawn_, my 12.04 is 64-bit and i can watch youtube without issues
[02:47] <blocky> anybody know what device I should install grub to?
[02:48] <SarahsButt> blocky: sda1
[02:48] <shawn_> but what will happen when you install some package without 64bit build? xD
[02:48] <iHarp> oscar76: It's not too much.. there is actually a formula to it
[02:48] <oscar76> blocky: preferably your first hd, and never a removable disk i guess
[02:48] <OerHeks> shawn_, it will run on ubuntu multiarch
[02:48] <blocky> parted is saying /dev/sr0 unrecognized disk label
[02:48] <Datz> what's up with the dependency problems when I try and install php5 on 12.04 gnome-session-fallback?
[02:48] <Guest135> re my previous question anything i can run on putty to see what mode (pio, udma6 etc etc) an attached usb drive is in? id usually use hdparm for this but it's not liking working on an external hdd.
[02:49] <blocky> how can I get a list of options
[02:49] <iHarp> oscar76: for 2G you would want atleast 4G; For 3 you would want 5 and for 4 you  would want 6
[02:50] <Somnio> hi! anyone on the mood to answer a couple of questions about gnome-shell on Ubuntu?
[02:50] <Ycarene> is there a way to force a package to ignore dependency conflicts and make it install.
[02:50] <wylde> Ycarene: yes, but it's not recommended.
[02:50] <rebe> is it possible to change terminal font size to float number like 10.5 instead of whole 10 or 11 ?
[02:51] <Ycarene> I think it'd be fine for what I want at least.
[02:51] <shawn_> OerHeks, do you mean the 64bit ubuntu can run 32bit program?
[02:51] <iHarp> rebe: Never tried that..lol good question
[02:51] <OerHeks> shawn_, yes, since 11.10 ubuntu is supporting multi-arch
[02:52] <Datz> Could someone tell me what these dependency problems are about when trying to install php5: http://pastebin.com/eq8cpUq1
[02:52] <OerHeks> no need for ia32 libs
[02:52] <wanna> :-(
[02:52] <blocky> Anyone know what it means when the LiveCD dumps you to BusyBox shell?
[02:53] <Datz> OerHeks: that's not directed towards me?
[02:53] <shawn_> OerHeks, Thank you, btw. how to shift my 32 ubuntu to 64 ?  should I re-install the  whole system
[02:53] <oscar76> iHarp: really? good to know.   For me it stills sounds so much.  Maybe because my hd is only 80G :(
[02:53] <OerHeks> Datz, no, it was ment for shawn.
[02:53] <shellcode28> how u create another hard disk
[02:53] <Ycarene> wylde - how do I do it with apt-get, I can't get --nodeps to work.
[02:53] <OerHeks> shawn_, only reinstall possible.
[02:54] <oscar76> shellcode28: you mean another partition?
[02:54] <shellcode28> yea
[02:54] <wylde> Ycarene: moment, I don't know off the top of my head. I only did it once a very long time ago heh.
[02:54] <oscar76> shellcode28: when you are installing ubuntu or afterwards?
[02:54] <iHarp> oscar76: Yea, you are looking at about 1G
[02:55] <shellcode28> I have already ubuntu
[02:55] <awunui> Hi
[02:55] <shawn_> Thanks,OerHeks&taxman,  When you get notice that 'shawn_ has quit()'  It means I am reinstalling ubuntu xD
[02:55] <blackmatrix_ny> hi all...why does netstat not show process for apache running on port 80...It just displays - for it
[02:55] <shellcode28> I already have ubuntu*
[02:55] <SarahsButt> shellcode28: download Gparted
[02:55] <shellcode28> I have gparted lol
[02:55] <oscar76> shellcode28: you can use Partition Manager or Gparted, but be careful
[02:56] <SarahsButt> shellcode28: that's what you gotta use
[02:56] <iHarp> << uses Gparted
[02:56] <shellcode28> I have Gparted
[02:56] <taxman> i trust only fdisk for performance proof
[02:56] <taxman> fdisk can control each detail
[02:57] <oscar76> iHarp: do you know if is it a hd size limit for ubuntu?
[02:57] <OerHeks> shellcode28, be sure the partition is not mounted.
[02:57] <shellcode28> OK,how can u tell if is not mounted
[02:57] <shellcode28> ?
[02:57] <wylde> Ycarene: you may need to use 'apt-get download <packagename>' then force the installation with dpkg....still checking

[03:11] <blocky> is it possible that on this motherboard, IDE devices are listed as SATA
[03:11] <blackmatrix_ny> bobweaver, you must know little about networking then my friend
[03:11] <Xlaits> l3top: I know that already...
[03:12] <bobweaver> blocky:  yes there are bugs like that
[03:12] <blackmatrix_ny> bobweaver, what kind of networking tool gives you the message 'Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
[03:12] <blackmatrix_ny>  will not be shown...'
[03:12] <L3top> Is this file on a server or local Xlaits?
[03:12] <bobweaver> blackmatrix_ny:  try    netstat -antp
[03:13] <oscar76> blocky: It happens to me too
[03:13] <Xlaits> L3top: Originally, Server. But I managed to download said file, because firefox is an arsehole.
[03:13] <blackmatrix_ny> bobweaver, still cannot identify a simple application like apache running on port 80 'LISTEN      -        '
[03:13] <blocky> I think this installation is choking because of something to do with the hard drive configuration
[03:13] <shawn_> firefox is good
[03:14] <blocky> there are 3 SATA disks and 2 more on IDE

[03:15] <blackmatrix_ny> bobweaver, you are asking me if I the pc is plugged in or not...cmon man

[03:15] <blocky> When the livecd boots, I get [sdg] attached SCSI removable disk
[03:15] <Xlaits> L3top: That is correct.
[03:15] <L3top> Xlaits: and do you have oracles jre or the openjre installed?
[03:15] <blocky> then it drops to a shell and says Mount a filesystem

[03:19] <blackmatrix_ny> bobweaver, a what ?
[03:19] <L3top> Understood... I was just suggesting that if you cannot get it going otherwise, you may need the oracle jre Xlaits. Just a thought.

[03:27] <zig> Im trying to add a user to the system and i want my new user to inherit my alias commands. How may i do this?
[03:27] <bobweaver> blocky:  the 1st thing I do is check the md5sum if that is all good I then setup my bios to make sure that cd is reading 1st if that is what I am booting from. the bot will send you more info
[03:27] <bobweaver> !md5sum >> blocky
[03:28] <Xlaits_> L3top: i686
[03:28] <blackmatrix_ny> LittleBallOfHate, both commands+options don't catch the apache running on port 80

[03:28] <L3top> ok grab the 32 bit Xlaits_
[03:28] <blackmatrix_ny> bobweaver, you give ubuntu a bad name man...stop playing
[03:28] <LittleBallOfHate> blackmatrix_ny: but ps aux|grep apache shows it running?
[03:28] <L3top> I will grab a smoke while it dlds
[03:28] <Xlaits_> L3top: RPM or tar.gz?
[03:28] <zig> littleBallofHate - from root user profile?
[03:28] <blocky> well I think the iso is okay because I used it to install on my laptop
[03:28] <L3top> tar.gz Xlaits_
[03:28] <blocky> it's possible it was corrupted when I copied it to my flash drive
[03:29] <LittleBallOfHate> zig: whoever you log in as and have the aliases setup as
[03:29] <blackmatrix_ny> LittleBallOfHate, yea...and my worry is that what other processes (trojans) is it not catching if it misses a big fish like apache
[03:29] <bobweaver> facepalm
[03:29] <zig> for now, i only have root account. want to create new user and still have alias. I will try that and get back with you
[03:29] <LittleBallOfHate> blackmatrix_ny: and /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default is configured to put it on 80?
[03:30] <blackmatrix_ny> another reason to migrate to openbsd for more security
[03:30] <LittleBallOfHate> zig: make sure permissions are right when you copy

[03:32] <ClientAlive> when I installed 12.04 server not long ago, I choose "use landscape to manage the system" during installation. From what little I've seen I'm starting to question that decision. Apart from paying for the service, is there any good reason for me to use it?
[03:32] <L3top> Xlaits_: take a look at this to begin with http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/linux/linux-jdk.html#install-32
[03:32] <blackmatrix_ny> LittleBallOfHate, I actually developed a scanning script on my AIX box and wanted to port it to Ubuntu but the netstat tool is so weak on ubuntu linux
[03:32] <LittleBallOfHate> blackmatrix_ny: if it's not showing stuff running you've got more problems than netstat
[03:33] <L3top> Xlaits_: and we are going to uninstall the openjre

[03:36] <hailey> I have installed 12.04 on this Compaq Presario V6000 and with it fully updated, I am unable to get the BCM4311 wirless NIC to work, doesn't seem possible.  I thought maybe if I could revert to one of the 2.6 kernels, I might have a shot but after the upgrades I can only boot the 3.2.0-24 kernel and I can only guess that this BCM-4311 is useless with this kernel.  Anyone know what can bee done here?

[03:49] <twig11> How can I add images to be shown in the default desktop backgrounds list in the Appearance settings? I found instructions saying to add an image to /usr/share/backgrounds, then navigate there from the Appearance settings app and select it, but it still doesn't show up in the selection of default backgrounds.

[03:56] <mohit> hi there. i need help. i have downloaded 12.04 twice, ripped the cd and tried to use it but eerytime, it turned out to be wubi. is anyone else finding a similar problem?
[03:56] <zig> and that way also set my prompt up how i was used to
[03:56] <zig> thanks
[03:56] <wylde> mohit: uhhhh... if you don't wany wubi, boot from the cd?
[03:56] <wylde> want*
[03:57] <paulus68> I run 12.04 server with 2 nics, under vmware 1 nic is comming up automaticly the 2nd doesn't but can be launched manually how do I get the 2nd nic up automaticly?
[03:57] <jrib> zig: one of the differences is that adduser will automatically copy the contents /etc/skel/ into your user's home
[03:57] <footvilla> hey guys is there like a package that installs some sort of system monitor? that you can access remotely
[03:57] <mohit> the problem is that i have tried to download the installer iso but when i brn a cd from it, it turns out to be wubi
[03:57] <footvilla> to check on system health cpu
[03:57] <footvilla> etc
[03:57] <bobweaver> mohit:  I know that this might sound silly but what happens when you turn the computer on with the cd in the drive . if it goes too windows you have to boot you cd in the 1st order of boot or load the boot menu if you have one
[03:57] <zig> yes, that was what i was looking for.
[03:57] <zig> i have the alias, and the promt im used to. Thanks.
[03:58] <wylde> mohit: all the install images have wubi on them.
[03:58] <blocky> hmm okay same problem as before, grub-install /dev/mapper failed
[03:58] <bobweaver> mohit:  all that can be done from the bios unless this is a mac ?

What's the trick to adding an image to the default set so any user can choose it and have it also show up as the lightdm background?
[03:58] <mohit> ok. its not a mac. an acer runing on windows vista
[03:58] <Psykus> figured this out by the way, xfce's power manager wasn't working correctly
[03:59] <Psykus> had to set the monitor settings in the screensaver menu instead
[03:59] <mohit> woud you have an idea, why the boot freezes when i try to use the cd?
[03:59] <bobweaver> mohit:  have you checked the md5sum ?
[03:59] <wylde> mohit: reboot with the cd in the drive. If it doesn't load from the cd you'll have to edit bios settings, or possibly hit f12 while the bios loads.
[03:59]  * paulus68 I hate vista
[04:01] <mohit> i checked the bios and it is set to boot from cd as the first preference.
[04:01] <hariom> I want to run my python script which has module import from the non standard location python (so python won't work but /opt/mylib/bin/python). I want to run this every 24 hours and any output of this should go to /var/log/myscript.log file. What should be the content of the cron script and where to keep it
[04:01] <Wildbat> is there a tools for tidying up indent for php/html ?
[04:01] <hariom> * 23 * * * /opt/mylib/bin/python /home/user/myscript.py > /var/log/myscript.log 2>&1       Is this correct?
[04:02] <paulus68> mohit: does the cd work on another pc/laptop
[04:02] <mohit> however i have not checked md5sum. how should i do that? i am trying to get back into ubuntu installed on my computer after installing vista
[04:02] <bobweaver> !md5sum | mohit
[04:02] <ubottu> mohit: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[04:02] <mohit> paul, dont have another comp to work on.
[04:03] <dr_willis> i was thinking the ccd had some sort of 'verify' item in its boot menus.. but that checks  the md5's of  the files. not the whole iso
[04:04] <hailey> After reboot, the BCM4311 works.  For some reason, I have to use CLI commands to connect, but it works.  Thanks all
[04:04] <mohit> will be back after checking md5s. thanks guys!
[04:04] <bobweaver> np hailey  enjoy
[04:04] <paulus68> mohit: ok if you burn another iso for instance server version, does it allow you to install server edition just a thought
[04:05] <paulus68> I run 12.04 server with 2 nics, under vmware 1 nic is comming up automaticly the 2nd doesn't but can be launched manually how do I get the 2nd nic up automaticly?
[04:05] <mohit> think no harm in trying. will try that as well. right now downloading from alternate source as well
[04:06] <dr_willis> paulus68:  quick fix.. put command in rc.local to  set it up. ;)

[04:12] <dr_willis> hnsz:  if you mean you  have no window borders/decoration - thats a sign that compiz crashed..  try 'compiz --replace' in a terminal if  you  can

[04:13] <paulus68> dr_willis: so basicly when I add there the command to bring the eth1 card up I will be good to go ?
[04:13] <dr_willis> paulus68:  yes. be sure its befor that last exit command in the file. and dont start anything that will take over the shell, or start things in the background. (common mistakes i see people make in here)
[04:14] <Guest97419> okay will try...be back soon
[04:14] <user1> hi, how to isntall bugzilla3 in ubuntu 10.04 server LTS, pls help me...
[04:14] <paulus68> dr_willis: just entering the things to bring the eth1 up and that's it
[04:15] <dr_willis> user1:  if its not in the repos. or a PPA. use the source.
[04:15]  * paulus68 **** never to old to learn**** thanks dr_Willis
[04:15] <Guest97419> woo hoo
[04:15] <Guest97419> that worked!
[04:15] <Guest97419> thanks!
[04:15] <bobweaver> Guest97419:  np you need to fix you gfx driver thou
[04:16] <user1> dr_willis, can u send me the link how to install bugzilla3
[04:16] <bobweaver> you can install bugzilla unser dev tools on mozilla
[04:16] <dr_willis> user1:  nope.. ive never used it.. the stndard routine is. check the repos.. check for  ppas or if all else fails resouirt to using the source for apps not in the repos.ppas
[04:17] <kameron> can someone help me with some basic drive mounting? I'm having a problem accessing the mounted drive by anyone except root.
[04:17] <Guest97419> ok bob...will do that...i know how to do that...not the cnl/alt/f1 thingy...but woo hoo anyway
[04:17] <dr_willis> kameron:  what filesystem is the FS in question
[04:17] <bobweaver> Guest97419:  glade too see that you are happy :)
[04:17] <kameron> dr_willis, ext4.
[04:18] <dr_willis> kameron:  then you need to set the proper ownersshiop or  permissions on the files   and dirs you  want the users to  access.
[04:18] <Guest97419> had the power go out yesterday and mucked up all the computers...lost a modem...had to fix win7 ip address...router settings...and it was a pain...but this...this is easy
[04:18] <paulus68> dr_willis: small question do I just enter ifconfig with all the parameters or would the syntax be different?
[04:18] <mohit> Guys MD5s are matching. trying different instances but have a feeling that there is something fundamentally wrong with what i might be doing!!
[04:19] <kameron> dr_willis, i have a drive that's completely blank and users can't create a directory or do anything. i'll paste my fstab for you to see.
[04:19] <dr_willis> paulus68:  same as you would use in the shell. since rc.local is ran as a shell script
[04:19] <kameron> dr_willis, http://paste.ubuntu.com/966145/
[04:19] <paulus68> dr_willis: but no need to add sudo I presume just to be sure
[04:19] <dr_willis> kameron:  you set permissions/ownership  on the mountpoint after you  mount it.. that  sets the permissions for the 'root' of the drive. OR make a directory and chown/chmod that. and let theusers access tghat dir
[04:19] <Guest97419> btw...do you suppose the outage or the update messed up the graphics?
[04:19] <dr_willis> paulus68:  rc.local  IS ran by the system.. so  its  allready  ran as root
[04:19] <bobweaver> mohit:  please explain too me like I ma a 7 yr old how you are trying too do this . (sometimes I act like a 7yr old) :)
[04:20] <kameron> dr_willis, all my drives i can access just fine except for the ext4 drive mounted to "StoreSwap"
[04:20] <dr_willis> kameron:  it all depoends on the filesystem in use and the ownership/modes/permissions of the drives filesystemjs
[04:20] <Guest97419> thanks bob  thanks much
[04:20] <dr_willis> kameron:  the other drives are what filesystem?
[04:21] <kameron> dr_willis, ext4 and ntfs
[04:21] <dr_willis> ntfs - is setable at mounttime - because it does NOT support the normal linux  permissions.
[04:21] <dr_willis> thats the only  way to set the permissions.ownership on ntfs.
[04:21] <mohit> i downloaded the iso file "ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso" burned it to a dvd successfully and am trying to boot from dvd (have set it as first preference in bios). the boot just freezes. i have done this with 4 dvds now.
[04:22] <dr_willis> for normal linuxx filesystems you normally follow the standard permission 'rules'
[04:22] <bobweaver> mohit:  where does it frezze ?
[04:22] <kameron> mohit try adding option "nomodeset" when you boot.
[04:23] <dr_willis> mohit:  you  are burning a cd image to  a dvd disk: no  cd disks? why not try a usb flash:
[04:23] <bobweaver> mohit: meaning .... do you get a spash screen anything or does it just go to windo z ?
[04:23] <kameron> dr_willis, i see what i did wrong. i didn't set permissions of the folder it's being mounted to. it's working now. thanks!
[04:23] <dr_willis> mohit:  how did you burn it to  disk
[04:23] <dr_willis> kameron:  the permissions of the 'folder' after its mounted.. is a reflection of the permissions of the root of  the drive.  BEFOr  the mount.. the permissions dont matter.
[04:24] <kameron> dr_willis, that was my problem
[04:24] <mohit> after getting through bios.it dosnt go to windows. a "_" in the top left corner of the screen just flashes as the dvd tries hard to read. after a while, as i eject th dvd, the boot quickly jumps to windows.
[04:25] <dr_willis> i always just make a directory called 'UsersStorage' on the root of  the drive and chown/chmod  that.. the useres dont need to  see the LOST+FOUND directory :)
[04:25] <mohit> i used imgburn for one and cdburnerxp another time on a different pc
[04:25] <bobweaver> mohit:  what kind of computer is this ?
[04:26] <L3top> did you check the md5sum mohit?
[04:26] <dr_willis> mohit:  id try a usb boot. and test out  those disks on a differnt pc.  Ive  heard of  mixxed results burning the cd iso  image to a blank  DVD also.,
[04:26] <mohit> i tried burning a CD as well. exactly the same result.
[04:26] <mohit> acer aspire 6930
[04:26] <dr_willis> bbl.
[04:26] <mohit> ok. let me try a usb boot

[04:30] <worm> I have a small problem on ssh.
[04:31] <hnsz> How can I invoke a fsck?
[04:31] <worm> I used ssh to connect to another's computer, but the wall command cannot show him any information.
[04:31] <worm> I want to tell him something by a pop-up window, but how?
[04:32] <bobweaver> worm:  notify-send "this is a message about foo "
[04:32] <hnsz> that's cute :)
[04:34] <wylde> !fsck | hnsz
[04:34] <ubottu> hnsz: fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo touch /forcefsck && sudo shutdown -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot
[04:35] <aaas> i cant ping my windows machines from ubuntu or my dd-wrt router, any ideas?
[04:35] <hnsz> wylde: Thanks
[04:35] <wylde> hnsz: np
[04:35] <worm> aaas: Any error message? Type ifconfig to see your network status.
[04:36] <aaas> worm network is fine, i can get out to internet on all boxes
[04:36] <aaas> worm ping error is "destination host unreachable"
[04:36] <aaas> worm firewall disabled on both sides
[04:37] <worm> aaas: That means you might have the wrong ip address of them.
[04:37] <bobweaver> aaas: are you on wifi ?
[04:37] <aaas> worm bobweaver no
[04:37] <aaas> not on wifi
[04:37] <aaas> windows machines can ping each other
[04:37] <aaas> dd-wrt sets static ips of all machines
[04:37] <aaas> cant ping by hostname or ip
[04:37] <bobweaver> are the other  machines up ?
[04:38] <aaas> bobweaver yes
[04:38] <worm> aaas: can you paste your ifconfig here?
[04:38] <bobweaver> aaas:  what does traceroute do ?
[04:38] <aaas> bobweaver traceroute to where?
[04:38] <aaas> worm one sec
[04:39] <bobweaver> to the other machines aaas
[04:39] <violinappren> worm:  before calling notify-send, you have to: export DISPLAY="0.0"

[04:39] <aaas> bobweaver unknown host
[04:39] <aaas> bobweaver ill try from the router

[04:42] <worm> aaas try ping 192.168.1.255 -b
[04:42] <blocky> I changed a bios setting from SATA enhanced to SATA compatible and now when I power on the machine it just says Express Gate
[04:42] <blocky> caps lock doesn't even work
[04:43] <aaas> worm works
[04:43] <hnsz> blocky: bios reset?
[04:43] <wylde> blocky: can you get back into bios to fix it? If not you're going to have to reset the bios :)
[04:43] <blocky> no, can't even get to bios
[04:43] <worm> aaas: Have you received some "DUP"?
[04:43] <hnsz> blocky: check your motherboard manual :)
[04:43] <aaas> worm "dup"?
[04:43] <blocky> what the hell asus, not cool
[04:44] <wylde> blocky: yep, what hnsz said
[04:44] <worm> aaas: something like time **ms (DUP!) or duplicates.
[04:44] <wylde> blocky: just because you CAN change a bios option, doesn't mean you should! lol >.<
[04:45] <aaas> worm no
[04:45] <worm> aaas try arp.
[04:45] <blocky> wylde I don't think it's supposed to lock up
[04:45] <worm> aaas:  it will show you the ip address and the mac address of the computers connected to yours.
[04:45] <aaas> worm windows machines show (incomplete) for hwtyp hwaddress flag amsk
[04:46] <worm> aaas then arping the ip address of the router and the windows machine.,
[04:46] <wylde> blocky: I would imagine not
[04:47] <rychusj> does anyone have any advice on how to fix a duplicate source.list entry?
[04:47] <worm> aaas: If everything works well, the reply of them included a broadcast and a lot of unicasts.
[04:47] <aaas> worm shows same info as 'arp' alone
=== Guest32270 is now known as Bogdaniel
[04:47] <bobweaver> rychusj:  sudo apt-get --fix-broken update

[04:48] <rychusj> bobweaver: tried it and still getting the same message
[04:49] <worm> aaas: How many broadcasts?
[04:49] <aaas> worm how do i know
[04:50] <worm> aaas: is that arping but not arp?
[04:50] <blocky> motherboard manual doesn't address this problem
[04:50] <hnsz> blocky: Which motherboard?
[04:50] <blocky> asus p5q pro
[04:50] <wylde> blocky: look for "bios reset"
[04:50] <bobweaver> rychusj:  could you use paste.ubuntu.com and paste the error that you are getting and also    cat /etc/apt/source.list
[04:51] <aaas> worm ah ok sorry, from router i get nothing
[04:51] <worm> aaas: at the end you can see the broadcasts and responds .(After you typed ^C)
[04:52] <aaas> worm 65 broadcasts
[04:52] <worm> aaas: no respond?
[04:52] <aaas> worm no, same from router #2
[04:52] <worm> aaas: can you try to ping those things again?
[04:52] <aaas> worm same with ubuntu machine
[04:53] <hnsz> blocky: you know what a jumper is?
[04:53] <aaas> worm from ubuntu -> windows #1 ('destination host unreachable'
[04:54] <aaas> worm same with router #1 and #2
[04:54] <aaas> worm routers -> ubuntu ping fine
[04:54] <blocky> hnsz, yeah I found it, back in bios now, thanks
[04:54] <hnsz> blocky: On the bottom you have two pci slots, right to those slot are three little pins on pin 1 and 2 there is a jumper. You have to put the jumper on pin 2 and 3 and then back on pin 1 2 again
[04:54] <rhizmoe> what can i use for arin lookups? like whois -a used to be
[04:55] <worm> aaas how about 192.168.1.151 and 192.168.1.1?
