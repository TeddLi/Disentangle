[08:56] <tallmf> there has got to be an easier way
[08:56] <AskHL> Perhaps sudo works better
[08:56] <_jason> tallmf: what do you mean by ``not working''
[08:56] <Guardiann> :)
[08:56] <fraggsta> tallmf: "sudo passwd", if you REALLY want to be able to log in as root :)
[08:57] <curley_sue> Is there anyone who can help with a configuration problem?

[11:00] <jhellen> wastrel, Thanks I will try to find it somewhere else then...maybe under root
[11:00] <acktvst> hi
[11:00] <acktvst> how can i install lame codecs?
[11:00] <wastrel> jhellen:  try locate <themename>
[11:00] <anto9us> linuxnewbie, the installer will allow you to select the partition to install to
[11:00] <amphi> linuxnewbie: the second is empty?
[11:00] <NOT_rynofly> hey im trying to install xfce ( desktop envonment) and as its checking its saying it can't find Glib (gmodule) >= 2.2.0
[11:00] <linuxnewbie> its empty
[11:00] <NOT_rynofly> how do i insatll it
[11:00] <wastrel> gnomefreak:  i seem to recall that themes used to live in ~/.gnome/themes  but on breezy i don't have that dir, just ~/.themes
[11:00] <linuxnewbie> as far as i understood, it didnt do anything
[11:00] <gnomefreak> sudo apt-get install whatever or use synaptic
[11:01] <amphi> linuxnewbie: you might be better off to delete it; then the installer can freely make the partitions it wants in the empty space
[11:01] <acktvst> how can i install lame codecs?
[11:01] <Seveas> NOT_rynofly, apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[11:01] <waldo_> if i want to set up an ubuntu box with a wireless card as an accesspoint with WPA, how would i do that?
[11:01] <linuxnewbie> how do i delete it?
[11:01] <gnomefreak> ahhhhhhh i thought it did too but im not sure if in breezy or not

[11:01] <amphi> waldo_: you have a card+driver that'll do master mode?
[11:01] <linuxnewbie> as i understood the installer wanted to delete my whole hard drive
[11:01] <Seveas> NOT_rynofly, ubuntu on xfce
[11:02] <Seveas> xubuntu-desktop is the package that installs it all
[11:02] <NOT_rynofly> seveas: ! yay i don't have to do it manually!
[11:02] <NOT_rynofly> ^_^
[11:02] <waldo_> amphi: i have access to both a prism/2.5 and a cisco aironet 350.  i reckon one of them will.
[11:02] <Seveas> NOT_rynofly, manually installing things is sooo 1990s ;)
[11:02] <gnomefreak> sudo apt-get install is manually
[11:02] <NOT_rynofly> now i know why i insatlled ubunto
