[18:55] <ace_suares> hello
[18:55] <nownot> rexy_: math is 200,000 byes = 1,600,000 bits right? then that does seem about right
[18:55] <Jowi> rianne, normally when you do a kernel upgrade with apt-get or synaptic, the old kernel will not be removed from the menu. At boot, press ESC and see if it's there
[18:55] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> hail!
[18:55] <mactimes> Kamus_H_Zwisch: Indeed =)
[18:55] <tribaldata> cornixx: can't find anything of value for you
[18:55] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> mactimes: :D
[18:55] <_6StringKng_> where in gconf-editor is the option to show mounted drives on the desktop, I disabled it a while back and now I forget where its at >.<
[18:55] <cornixx> :(
[18:55] <mactimes> Kamus_H_Zwisch: You got that right =)  Carioca da gema =)
[18:56] <cornixx> tribaldata: Thanks anyhow
[18:56] <EduardoSal> Take it easy kamus
[18:56] <Disastro> zenobius: where?
[18:56] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> mactimes: carioca de gema
[18:56] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> :p
[18:56] <rexy_> nownot: yes, there's a bit of overhead involved for the tcp vpn and streaming of video
[18:56] <tribaldata> cornixx: your best bet would be to try to find a users that got the same card as you
[18:56] <EduardoSal> My english is very peba
[18:56] <Nrbelex2> rexy_ and DSpair, sorry - just switched computers
[18:56] <Disastro> new to xubuntu :)
[18:56] <DSpair> Nrbelex: For the nm-applet information, just look at /var/log/messages and that should show you everything you need. If you want you can use "grep" to filter on NetworkManager.
[18:56] <Dreyffusz> EduardoSal:  ehehehe
[18:56] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> EduardoSal: suck my holy pirulitos de morango
[18:56] <Ryan450> hey all
[18:56] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> hey nobody
[18:57] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> :p
[18:57] <cornixx> tribaldata:  Spent 2 days now trying to fix that stuff, reading tons of tutorials and forums. I'm just fed up with Linux for now and be back to Win I guess
[18:57] <EduardoSal> Uepa.
[18:57] <zenobius> Disastro: should be under your system menu
[18:57] <cornixx> See when Linux gets more userfriendly
[18:57] <Dreyffusz> cor what happened?
[18:57] <EduardoSal> Kamus go to well [
[18:57] <ace_suares> cornixx
[18:57] <EduardoSal> hehe
[18:57] <Dreyffusz> cornixx:  what happened?
[18:57] <tribaldata> cornixx: i'm sure you will find out soon, keep it as a dual boot ;)
[18:57] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> EduardoSal: and you to hell
[18:57] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> :d
[18:57] <zenobius> Disastro: im not running xfce desktop here , so cant reality check on the fly.
[18:57] <makers_mark> i'm running ubuntu 7.10 and i installed kde a couple of days ago but then decided to switch back to gnome.so i ran "sudo apt-get remove kde" and "sudo apt-get remove kdm" but the system load screen still says "Kubuntu" instead of the original "Ubuntu" screen.how can i fix that?
[18:57] <nownot> rexy_: thanks, guess im going to have to go with the 15/15 fios then

[18:58] <Disastro> i have applications > system, but there's no such a thing
[18:58] <tribaldata> !splashscreen
[18:58] <ubotu> To change the Gnome splash screen, use !gnome-splashscreen-manager or change the GConf key /apps/gnome-session/options/splash_image using !gconf-editor.
[18:58] <ace_suares> makers_mark: hmmm.. sontheing with ubuntu-artwork, i think
[18:58] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> makers_mark: is something about configure alternatives
[18:58] <rexy_> nownot 15/15 fios?
[18:58] <cornixx> And I'm keeping it dualboot anyhow till Linux supports all games in Win-speed ;)
[18:58] <ace_suares> How can I get my PC to boot again ?
[18:58] <EduardoSal> The lines here fly
[18:58] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> fly?
[18:58] <Arjun> PurpZeY, coming up

[18:59] <alec__> ah
[18:59] <alec__> i c
[19:00] <DSpair> Nrbelex2: Use the "tail" command and "grep" commands to watch for "NetworkManager". Then try to connect to a network.

[19:00] <cornixx> Anyone here is running his PC on a Radeon 9800 Pro and is able to set resolutions higher than 1280*1024?
[19:00] <javb> i did a fresh install of ubuntu gutsy, i used limewire, now i installed it and it will start pefect but it does not connect. Ubuntu gusty comes with some kind of firewall i dont kwno that is causing this? or any other idea?
[19:00] <bluefox83> no
[19:00] <r-wolf> "play file.mp3" keeps silence! what's the matter?
[19:00] <tribaldata> cornixx: i never asked but what are the driver your are running for your card ?
[19:01] <Dreyffusz> jav it doesnt come with firewall
[19:01] <javb> ?
[19:01] <zenobius> cornixx: depends on waht mode your using to display and wether your monitor supports it ie xinerama, mergefb etc
[19:01] <Disastro> zenobius: what program is trackerd?
[19:01] <Disastro> it uses 70-80% of my cpu
[19:01] <Dreyffusz> javb: limewire is just buggeh
[19:01] <cornixx> tribaldata: After messing around with the open source and proprietary drivers from the repo I installed envy and got the original ones
[19:01] <bluefox83> gutsy doesn't have a built in firewall that inhibits anything, however, you need to refresh your list of sources in limewire
[19:01] <zenobius> Disastro: a search and indexing thing, much better than beagle
[19:01] <Dreyffusz> javb: try frostwire, its better anyways xP
[19:01] <Arjun> PurpZeY, dont wory dude Im just gona go back to the darkside of windowz
[19:01] <Nrbelex2> DSpair, Linux is a bit foreign to me... in what context do I use the commands in the terminal?
[19:01] <zenobius> Disastro: but still a drain
[19:01] <cornixx> tribaldata:  Which at least allowed me to use dual head
[19:02] <javb> Dreyffusz  ---> same issue with frostwire.
[19:02] <Disastro> it just came to top of the list
[19:02] <cornixx> zenobius: It works fine in WinXP
[19:02] <Disastro> is it ok to kill
[19:02] <Dreyffusz> javb: :-\
[19:02] <rafallo> I need some help
[19:02] <zenobius> Disastro: if you dont need that kind of thing remove it all together "sudo apt-get remove trackerd tacker-search-tool'
[19:02] <DSpair> Nrbelex2: Open a command prompt and obtain root privileges.
[19:02] <Dreyffusz> javb: I had that once I cant remeber how I fixed it >_<
[19:02] <rafallo> Jan  2 18:37:26 rafallo gdm[6722]: WARNING: gdm_slave_xioerror_handler: Fatal X error - Restarting :0

[19:03] <DSpair> Nrbelex2: Type "tail -f /var/log/messages | grep -i networkmanager" and press <ENTER>
[19:03] <rexy_> Nrbelex2: are you connecting to a wep or wpa network? do you have the proper key etc?
[19:03] <Xadacka> Hello World

[19:03] <Dreyffusz> Ok I have a question for you (curiosity): howcome people say slackware is lighter or w.e. then ubuntu and yet it uses 6 CDs for installation while ubuntu only needs one?

After completion and installing grub to the MBR windows gives a BSOD on boot. Linux boots fine
[19:10] <chipsa964> is there a way i can run internet explorer? theres an important web site i need to get to that doesnt support firefox

[19:11] <bsdlogical> chipsa964, you should be able to install it using wine
[19:11] <zenobius> shawn: Dreyffusz has the way
[19:11] <chipsa964> bsdlogical, i tried
[19:11] <chipsa964> it says check my permissions

[19:14] <RenatoSilva> what's a regex for a commented command line? "^[ ]+[#]+[ ]+*" ?
[19:14] <Dreyffusz> yemu: the only solution I found so  far is not upgrading xD
[19:14] <cptR3D> anyone think they can help? my volume button disappeared somehow
[19:14] <Kasplatt> pike_: am considering buying a Alienware laptop
[19:14] <kbrosnan> chipsa964: http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page
[19:14] <Kasplatt> Dreyffusz: one from toshiba , but it was only for school so it's okay
[19:15] <pike_> Kasplatt: its mostly just a form factor you dont get performance equal to what you spend and if you want ultralight there are other alternatives. course personally i wouldnt spend more than 900 on a lappy so maybe my perpective is diff from yours
[19:15] <yemu> Dreyffusz: it's a little to late :-( cause i already upgraded
[19:15] <chipsa964> kbrosnan, i just got there, thanks :D
[19:15] <pike_> Kasplatt: we're in #ubuntu-offtopic if youd like to discuss it
[19:15] <yemu> is id possible to downgrade only the kernel?
[19:15] <Dreyffusz> yemu: :-(
[19:15] <alec__> Can someone help me with an audio problem I"m having.
[19:15] <pike_> yemu: yes
[19:15] <zenobius> RenatoSilva: i think full-stop is for matching any character
[19:15] <cornixx> Man, this sucks :(
[19:15] <yemu> pike_:  can you give more info?
[19:16] <zenobius> RenatoSilva: and i think that the power symbol '^' is for matching strings that at the start of the line
[19:16] <cornixx> Was looking forward to running Ubuntu on my desktop, too
[19:16] <Jowi> Kasplatt, disregarding the SONY screwups (is that an adult word?) the quality level of the recent VAIO's is quite bad. HDD crashes and failed MB's mainly.
[19:16] <Nrbelex2> So... can anyone help me with a wireless connection where I can see networks but not connect to them?
[19:16] <zenobius> cornixx: blame microsfts monopolistic control of hardware support
[19:16] <Dreyffusz> cornixx: what the big issue ur having?
[19:16] <pike_> yemu: gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst you can boot whatever kernel is in there. you can either grab a kernel package or whatever
[19:16] <Flare183> shawn: press alt+f2 then type in gksu nautilus
[19:16] <Kasplatt> Jowi: ahh , okay ..

[19:28] <Jowi> sentano, I haven't tried either or them. In principal on x86 hardware, you do the same as on the dualboot setup (let grub boot the other OS's from their partition(s)). The partitioning is the most challenging part - deciding how much space each OS gets. You might need to set up an extended partition to handle more partitions then the first 4.

[20:10] <SpaminaCan> what do i do then?
[20:10] <Karyom> Thanks!!
[20:10] <vee_> zenobius I have a mixed bag when it comes to sharing... this will mainly be used for backing up my os x machine
[20:11] <zenobius> vee_: but if you can get an all linux enviroment, then go for nfs
[20:11] <zenobius> osx support nfs
[20:11] <SpaminaCan> i have to use windows and linux on the drive.....
[20:11] <krazytekn0> SpaminaCan, well, first question, do you have files on there that you need?
[20:11] <SpaminaCan> copying them right now ^_^
[20:11] <vee_> zenobius nfs stores info better
[20:11] <SpaminaCan> 9mins left ^_^
[20:11] <krazytekn0> And second question, do you need to be able to see the files with windows?
[20:11] <zenobius> vee_: microsoft have a nfs tool, but its not reliable
[20:11] <SpaminaCan> copying 90gb via usb :-\
=== croppa_ is now known as croppa
[20:12] <zenobius> vee_: and its twice as fast than samba
[20:12] <IKE> zenobius,  do you know what that error means
[20:12] <krazytekn0> gross man, just gross
[20:12] <zenobius> IKE: not sure, but my ipod id fine
[20:12] <krazytekn0> SpaminaCan do you need to access this drive with a windows box in the future?
[20:12] <SpaminaCan> krazytekn0, not true lol, i have a 80gb ipod that uses fat32 ^_^
[20:12] <IKE> do i get that error cuz im using a custom psp firmware?
[20:12] <SpaminaCan> yeah....
[20:12] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: just be glad your not on usb v1....copying 600mb is liek a 3hr job
[20:12] <vee_> zenobius unfortunately there are machines that need to run that.... mayeb sometime in the future.... for now im assuming the i should jjust pick ext 3 journeling
[20:13] <SpaminaCan> zenobius, what is this usb1 you speak of ^_^
[20:13] <zenobius> vee_: oh yeah ext2 for your drives but use nfs for netowrking if you can
[20:13] <SpaminaCan> i have a 32mb usb1 thumbdrive in my room lol
[20:13] <andu> care eshti din TM?
[20:13] <krazytekn0> SpaminaCan, well if you're right then you don't need me. gparted is the easiest way to format
[20:13] <penguinguy1234> is there a way to boot from an iso image without burning it to a disk?
[20:13] <krazytekn0> "apt-get install gparted"
[20:13] <andu> care eshti din TM?
[20:13] <andu> care eshti din TM?
[20:14] <IKE> english andu
[20:14] <SpaminaCan> thanks i forgot about gparted ^_^
[20:14] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: its the first incarnation of the USB protocol .....its restricted to 12megbits a second....
[20:14] <hendrixski> I know I can edit my /boot/grub/menu.lst file... but I'm trying to advise a friend who's not comfortable with editing config files.  Is there a graphical tool that manages grub for you?
[20:14] <vee_> zenobius i will thanks.... you mean ext3 right instead for ext2
[20:14] <zenobius> vee_: yeah
[20:14] <vee_> zenobius just checking =)
[20:14] <SpaminaCan> i wish i had a firewire port on my laptop lol
[20:14] <HardDisk> penguinguy1234, boot from an iso image without burning yea, use a vmware :)
[20:14] <SpaminaCan> that would ROCK lol
[20:14] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: usb2 is actually faster
[20:14] <Nrbelex2> I have a wireless issue where I can see networks but not connect. When doing a tail and grep to the syslog for the NetworkManager, I usually get a string of "old device 'wlan0' activating, won't change." and then it re-asks me for a WEP key... any thoughts?
[20:14] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: or is it?
[20:15] <SpaminaCan> i thought usb was slower then firewire
[20:15] <danbhfive> anyone know about vte?
[20:15] <penguinguy1234> HardDisk: I meant to install ubuntu on the actual computer
[20:15] <HardDisk> penguinguy1234, yes you can do a PXE installation.
[20:15] <HardDisk> install over network
[20:15] <SoulChild> What do i need the linux-headers package for ?
[20:15] <krazytekn0> zenobius, it's only faster in theory, in reality firewire 400 is still faster than usb2 with big files. (at least for me)
[20:15] <pike_> Nrbelex2: does like sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid blah key 12344556; sudo dhclient  <-- work?
[20:15] <hendrixski> Is there a graphical GRUB utility that would manage /boot/grub/menu.lst for you?
[20:15] <SpaminaCan> i know a firewire drive spins faster ^_^
[20:15] <penguinguy1234> HardDisk: I suppose that works...
[20:15] <brobostigon> good evening
[20:15] <MikeH> if java isn't working in firefox for me, and I've installed jre1.2-mozilla-plugin
[20:16] <MikeH> what am I missing?
[20:16] <HardDisk> hendrixski, yes, startup-manager
[20:16] <danbhfive> MikeH install the sun-java plugin instead
[20:16] <zenobius> krazytekn0: interesting....maybe its the host/controller thingy that laggs it up
[20:16] <hendrixski> HardDisk, cool thanks
=== |_James_Bond_| is now known as polizei
[20:16] <HardDisk> penguinguy1234, http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_pxe_install_server
[20:16] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: spins faster? lol
[20:16] <SpaminaCan> why does my computer lagg when copying files?
[20:17] <Nrbelex2> pike_ yes, I think so
[20:17] <brobostigon> i have started to learn python, and was wondering what people thought about it??
[20:17] <SpaminaCan> zenobius, firewire drivers read/write/spin faster then usb drivers ^_^
[20:17] <penguinguy1234> HardDisk: I know how to PXE install
[20:17] <HardDisk> SpaminaCan, check your harddrive.
=== polizei is now known as |_James_Bond_|
[20:17] <danbhfive> python is cool, but this it ot
[20:17] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: funny , when i copy files to/from my ipod in windows, windows stops becoming a mutlitasking OS
[20:17] <hendrixski> HardDisk, I'm apt-cache searching for something like that and not finding it.. does it go by a different name?
[20:17] <Nrbelex2> pike_, although I'm not sure what constitutes "working"
[20:18] <krazytekn0> brobostigon python is a great language for learning about all kinds of programming
[20:18] <SpaminaCan> zenobius, who uses windows to put songs on windows?, there is gtk pod ^_^
[20:18] <roentgen> Anyone to recommend a file-manager (preferably Total Commander style)?
[20:19] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: when im playing wow, and yeah...it all goes downhill from there
[20:19] <brobostigon> roentgen: in cli mc is good
[20:19] <vee_> zenobius just so i have you clear. mount the second drive under /media/second or /home/second so that all users have access to it? i want to reinstall in a couple of minutes
[20:19] <MikeH> danbhfive, I'm grabbing sun-java6-jre
[20:19] <krazytekn0> roentgen mc
[20:19] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: mind you im not copyiong while playing
[20:19] <MikeH> that right?
[20:19] <SpaminaCan> wow...., how does wow work in linux?, just like in windows?
[20:19] <lgc> roentgen, gnome-commander?
[20:19] <IKE> what does "[75388.484000] usb 2-8: device not accepting address 19, error -62" mean
[20:19] <SpaminaCan> or is windows still better for wow?
[20:19] <brobostigon> midnight commander
[20:19] <roentgen> lgc: gnome commander sounds interesting
[20:20] <roentgen> I need GUI apps
[20:20] <lgc> roentgen, it does all 'mc' does, but on a graphical interface.
[20:20] <zenobius> vee_: no ..always mount your drives under /media(which only gives access to you as the admin) then you provide folders under that (/media/secondDrive) to users
[20:20] <roentgen> mc is too awkward in shortcuts
[20:20] <hendrixski> SpaminaCan, not playing WOW is still better for your chances of getting laid :-p
[20:20] <hendrixski> SpaminaCan, but yes, it works just fine.... probably better than Vista because there's none of that bloat slowing your computer down
[20:21] <zenobius> vee_: so the drive at (/media/SecondDrive) and a fodler under that(/media/secondDrive/Share)
[20:21] <HardDisk> hendrix enable your repos, it's called startup-manager
[20:21] <vee_> zenobius thanks.... im gonna reinstall now..... let you know how its going... thanks for all your help so far- its been helpful
[20:21] <lgc> roentgen, mc is a classic. But one is too accustomed to GUIs nowadays...
[20:21] <SpaminaCan> hendrixski, who says wow cant get u laid :P
[20:21] <IKE> what does "[75388.484000] usb 2-8: device not accepting address 19, error -62" mean
[20:21] <zenobius> vee_: make sure you add users to group that can read write tot hat folder
[20:21] <HardDisk> hendrixski, sorry startupmanager
[20:21] <brobostigon> i use mc all the time
[20:22] <vee_> zenobius ok
[20:22] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: running wow under linux depened on how powerful your system is
[20:22] <crazyduck2> I'm having a huge problem with my ubuntu. Yesterday it restarted, and since then, it hasn't been able to activate my KDE desktop at all and on my GNOME desktop all it shows is a GIANT mouse cursor.
[20:22] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: most people get good results, but i cant be stuffed and franly dont want to bloat my linux install with wine
[20:22] <roentgen> gnome-commander seems fast :)
[20:22] <SpaminaCan> 1.25gb of ram, 1.2ghz, enough space ^_^
[20:23] <drew_chicago> for dial-up I'm using Gnome PPP I noticed the timer runs two or three times faster than it should. Any ideas how to fix this?
[20:23] <hendrixski> SpaminaCan, popular wisdom says so.   But lke I said.  It works just fine with Codega from what I hear
[20:23] <krazytekn0> mc is one of the fastest easiest file managers ever, it just takes a little time to learn, but it's not even as hard as learning something like nano
[20:23] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: your cpu is only 1.2ghz?
[20:23] <hendrixski> HardDisk, I'll check my repos and try again
[20:23] <SpaminaCan> its a laptop...
[20:23] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: i have an amd athlon xp 1.8ghx with 1gb ddr233mhz ram....and wow is still not a t full settings in windows
[20:24] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: in wine, best i can get is 3fps
[20:24] <SpaminaCan> :-\
[20:24] <SpaminaCan> OW!!! lol
[20:24] <hendrixski> crazyduck2, that sounds serious, what did you do?
[20:24] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: in windows, best i get is about 30fps
[20:24] <crazyduck2> hendrixski, literally nothing. Just restarted.
[20:25] <Yv12345vY> crazyduck2, when you're at the login screen, can you select GNOME as the session?
[20:25] <Nrbelex2> How does one check what kernel they are using?
[20:25] <SpaminaCan> can i rename an hd in linux?, i know i can in windows ^_^
[20:25] <crazyduck2> Yv12345vY, yup, and it loads to a really oversized desktop with about a 4 inch red cursor that just moves around but doesn't click anything.
[20:25] <brobostigon> Nrbelex2: uname -r
[20:26] <Conny> Good evening. What filemanager to use, for finding duplicates in large folders (recursive laso) ?
[20:26] <ajmal> any body know how to install arch linux
[20:26] <Nrbelex2> brobostigon thanks
[20:26] <krazytekn0> crazyduck2 have you installed anything lately?
[20:26] <SpaminaCan> zeno i get 13-19 Frames/sec maybe that is why i stopped playing lol
[20:26] <crazyduck2> krazytekn0, not at all. I didn't even do an update yet.
[20:26] <brobostigon> ajmal: not the place to ask
[20:26] <lgc> SpaminaCan, would you settle for an entry point on your filesystem?
[20:27] <SpaminaCan> what do u mean lgc?
[20:27] <ajmal> i want to install corel draw 9 and also inpage 2.4 what should i do for its installation
[20:27] <zenobius> hendrixski: the question of getting laid only has relevance to those who are controlled by their homrones and not their brain
[20:27] <SpaminaCan> can i defrag linux?
[20:27] <axscode> click install
[20:27] <hendrixski> crazyduck2, have you tried "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver" yet?
[20:27] <Yv12345vY> SpaminaCan, there is no need to defrag in Linux.
[20:27] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: yes but not required
[20:27] <brobostigon> spaminacan: no need
[20:27] <zenobius> lol
[20:28] <zenobius> blam blam blam
[20:28] <corinth> I have a friend in an IM that has his wireless not working. It was fine last night, he didn't change anything, but it's not working today. Works fine on his Windows install. Any suggestions?
[20:28] <SpaminaCan> how do i defrag ^_^, its not required but could i hurt?
[20:28] <crazyduck2> hendrixski, yup, no luck.
[20:28] <lgc> SpaminaCan, you can, for example, make the "videos" dir and mount your partition to it through the fstab file.
[20:28] <elde1> Everytime i try to start Tremulous or Warsow it goes to a black screen.. i have audio but can see nothing.. it forces em to do a hard reboot. what am i doing worng?
[20:28] <ajmal> i want to install corel draw 9
[20:28] <SpaminaCan> how come i cant unmount my external hd?
[20:28] <ajmal> any body help me
[20:28] <axscode> ajmal: no problem, install it
[20:28] <Yv12345vY> corinth, right click on network manager in top right and make sure "Enable wireless" is selected.
[20:28] <hendrixski> crazyduck2, hhmm.  bizare.  It wouldn't just do that.  It had worked at one point though, right?
[20:28] <brobostigon> ajmal: google
[20:28] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: seriously you wont notice a diff if you do....i could drwa adiagram why its pontless and mostly you want to defrag because your used to windows flaying your bits and bytes
[20:29] <crazyduck2> I see a new error on the console where it shows everythings booting progress. It says /etc/rc.local: 14; newline expected.
[20:29] <SpaminaCan> when i try it remounts it saying i cant unmount it
[20:29] <ajmal> how axscod:
[20:29] <crazyduck2> Yup, hendrixski, it's been working wonderfully for about  4 months.
[20:29] <Nrbelex2> I'm trying to install an off-brand wireless USB adapter using ndiswrapper - is there a good guide anyone knows of?
[20:29] <SpaminaCan> can i defrag a fat32 partition from windwos?
[20:29] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: tell me again waht version of ubuntu your using? gutsy or fiesty?
[20:29] <hendrixski> SpaminaCan, yeah, defrag isn't required on solid operating systems like Mac and Linux
[20:29] <lgc> SpaminaCan, you must be doing something wrong.
[20:29] <axscode> click install
[20:29] <th0r> crazyduck2 you need to end the file rc.local with a carriage return
[20:29] <SpaminaCan> Fiesty gutsy HATES my laptop lol
[20:30] <th0r> crazyduck2 all scripts need to end on a blank line
[20:30] <SpaminaCan> i mean can i format my windows fat 32 partition from linux....***
[20:30] <Yv12345vY> Nrbelex2, if you have a Windows driver you just use ndiswrapper to point it to that driver, should be pretty straight forward.  Have you tried ndisgtk?
[20:30] <ajmal> how can i install corel draw 9. i am using ubuntu 7.04
[20:30] <crazyduck2> How would I edit it. VI and NANO won't even let me into it?
[20:30] <SpaminaCan> wifi, sound, my mouse all do not work in Gutsy but perfectly in Fiesty
[20:30] <SpaminaCan> ^_^
[20:30] <zenobius> hendrixski: OS has nothing to do with it....its about he filesystem and how data is written to the disk
[20:30] <axscode> ajmal join #ubuntu
[20:30] <lgc> SpaminaCan, yes, of course.
[20:30] <Nrbelex2> Yv12345vY, I'll give it a try, thanks
[20:30] <hendrixski> crazyduck2, and you haven't done anything, over those 4 months, that could have triggered this,  like accidently rewrite something in an /etc file
[20:30] <zenobius> hendrixski: but i can see how you would see that to be a OSthing
[20:30] <buzz-cp> does anyone know how to display special characters? see pic: http://img117.imageshack.us/img117/1430/weirdcharswy0.jpg
[20:31] <SpaminaCan> why does Gutsy hate me so much lol
[20:31] <ajmal> i have joined but no body help me axscode:
[20:31] <elde1> Everytime i open Tremulous or Warsow to play it. it goes to a black screen, i have audio... but can see nothing.
[20:31] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: because gutsy is buggy still
[20:31] <Yv12345vY> SpaminaCan, Gutsy hates me too but I like it anyways.
[20:31] <hendrixski> zenobius, *sigh.  but some operating systems use good filesystems, some operating systems are restricted to using crappy filesystems.
[20:31] <axscode> you have to wait..
[20:31] <pike_> SpaminaCan: you probably are in the dir id bet a umount -l /mountpoint would work but id make sure you arent in the dir
[20:31] <axscode> ajmal, is that corel for linux?
[20:31] <krazytekn0> axscode you realize he's here already and you're talking to him in this channel
[20:31] <krazytekn0> ??
[20:31] <brobostigon> gutsy is working ok for me, and i have a mac, an unsupported
[20:32] <SpaminaCan> i like gutsy but so much does not work..., why was it made a release if its so buggy?, and i tried umount.... still spins.......
[20:32] <crazyduck2> hendrixski, so sudo gedit /etc/rc.local/ and see if I can get in and just enter another blank line?
[20:32] <pike_> SpaminaCan: you tried lazy umount?
[20:32] <corinth> Yv12345vY: I only see "Enable networking", which is ticked
[20:32] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: so you can report bugs
[20:32] <buzz-cp> anyone know how to display special characters? http://img117.imageshack.us/img117/1430/weirdcharswy0.jpg
[20:32] <Nrbelex2> Yv12345vY, where is ndisgtk?
[20:32] <SpaminaCan> zenobius, i thought that was what the tribe releases was for?
[20:32] <krazytekn0> SpaminaCan, This is how ubuntu works, you want rock like stability use the latest LTS release instead of the latest testing release
[20:32] <SpaminaCan> i mean heck i mute my sound in gutsy and it still plays lol......
[20:32] <th0r> crazyduck2 you should be able to just delete it...a quote from my rc.local....# By default this script does nothing.
[20:32] <Yv12345vY> corinth, but does your friend have it?  You said it was another machine.
[20:32] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: and provide your input and suggestions...which you would have a hard time doing with and seeing hte results of with windows
[20:33] <hendrixski> crazyduck2, if it's in one of those rc files then it's out of my league.  I've not learned anything about them.  But if the error points you there, make sure you back everything up before you change it
[20:33] <corinth> Yv12345vY: Yeah, but he's right next to me.
[20:33] <SpaminaCan> *grins at vista*

[20:35] <Eyemean> ?
[20:35] <SpaminaCan> if i remember :)
[20:35] <zenobius> zenobius: tool late you actualy need to get a coffee
[20:35] <Nrbelex2> So how do I do it through the terminal, Yv12345vY? Is there a guide for Ubuntu?
[20:35] <Yv12345vY> corinth, I have a problem sometimes connecting to a known wireless network, I usually select another network and then go back to the one I want to connect to.  Can you try that?
[20:35] <Yv12345vY> Nrbelex2, try sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get install ndisgtk
[20:35] <zenobius> SpaminaCan: ask him if xp has better or wrse networking code than win2000
[20:35] <Nrbelex2> Yv12345vY, I don't have an internet connection...
[20:36] <glb10>  is there anyone that can help me with a bluetooth key

[20:44] <Yv> Nrbelex2, also, have you tried going to System -> Administration -> Restricted Drivers Manager?  I got my wireless driver installed that way.
[20:45] <ikonia> bob__: dlink routers ?
[20:45] <bob__> yep
[20:45] <glb10> pike_ i ve onlt to install it?

[20:46] <ikonia> bob__: ok, so what's the deal, you can connect through a modem but not the router ?
[20:46] <Yv> IKE, you plug it into the USB port and should work from there.
[20:46] <brobostigon> ike: just plug it in

[20:47] <bob__> yep.. really odd.. I cannot 192.168.0,1 into it either.
[20:47] <Seveas> Nrbelex2, best idea is to hook up a wired conenction temporarily to install it
[20:47] <Yv> Nrbelex2, you have to download it
[20:47] <ikonia> bob__: are you sure the router is using address range of 192 ?
[20:47] <bob__> other computers can get through just not this new one
[20:47] <ikonia> bob__: do you  get a dhcp address from it when you plug it in ?

[20:47] <bob__> direct connect

[21:00] <ikonia> jtholmes: look up the package on launchpad
[21:00] <zenobius> IKE is the HDD a usb device?
[21:00] <bense> what's a good graphical ftp client other than gftp anyone?
[21:00] <glb10> krazytekno now i write you the error
[21:00] <Xera> Hmm yeah, the volume is really really low even with it set to 100% in the volume control
[21:00] <IKE> yes
[21:00] <cliebow> jtholmes, jorge castro is upsteam liaison
[21:00] <ikonia> floatingredwagon: what I did with the other guy is check where the installer has got to. I suggest booting from the cdrom and mounting the disk manually to see what's on it
[21:00] <krazytekn0> bense almost any file manager is an FTP client
[21:00] <whitehat> ikonia: says "the configuration could not be loaded" "you are now allowed to access the system configuration"
[21:01] <jtholmes> cliebow how do i contact jorge castro
[21:01] <ikonia> whitehat: when you do in the terminal "sudo apt-get update" and it asks you for a password, does it then work
[21:01] <jtholmes> his email i mean
[21:01] <glb10> krzytekno programmation error...in the list
[21:01] <zenobius> hope noone asks how to mount an iphone

[21:01] <Yv12345vY> kidding!
[21:01] <jdh6403> lol
[21:02] <floatingredwagon> ikonia: I think i was going for that same idea.  I'm in rescue terminal, opened a shell on the partition.  ls shows an expected root directory.
[21:02] <whitehat> ikonia: I don't have internet access on the laptop.trying to config wireless.but yes sudo does ask for password
[21:02] <cliebow> jtholmes, he is logged in #ltsp..otherwise launchpad
[21:02] <IKE> zenobius,  it is a usb why?
[21:02] <kevo_tool> Seveas: http://pastebin.com/d2c2fdfb4 (in case you missed the first one)
[21:02] <jdh6403> i have this toaster zenobius........and it wont accept sudo

[21:02] <floatingredwagon> ikonia: Good to hear.  How can i fix the Grub setup?
[21:03] <ompaul> !offtopic
[21:03] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[21:03] <ikonia> floatingredwagon: are you linux friendly or new ?
[21:03] <viamptor>  irc.freenode.net
[21:03] <whitehat> ikonia: I'm thinking it's a dbus thingy but not sure
[21:03] <ompaul> !grub | floatingredwagon
[21:03] <ubotu> floatingredwagon: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[21:03] <floatingredwagon> ikonia: I know enough to be dangerous.  If install behaves, I can load a system, and keep it running.
[21:03] <ikonia> whitehat: why are you thinking it's anything to do with dbus ?
[21:03] <Yv12345vY> zenobius, <IKE> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50531/

[21:05] <Yv12345vY> Ttech, you're right, I misread it, sorry

[21:05] <Ryuki> got it
[21:05] <Ryuki> sorry.
[21:05] <IKE> ompaul, what?

[21:07] <tribaldata> Ryuki: installation of what ?
[21:07] <Dagaka> newbie: sorry my bad, its actually called BartPE > http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/
[21:07] <Ryuki> a rpm file
[21:07] <Ryuki> how do I force install it?
[21:07] <Flannel> buzz-cp: That's gnome terminal, right?  Go to the gnome-terminal options and I imagine there ought to be some option for character encoding.  I'm unsure as to where it is though.
[21:07] <Dagaka> newbie: I believe it is however unfortunately Windows based...
[21:07] <ompaul> !rpm | Ryuki
[21:07] <ubotu> Ryuki: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu uses !APT, not RPM. RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
