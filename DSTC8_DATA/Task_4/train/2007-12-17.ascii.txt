[01:45] <ovid> if someone can help! :D
[01:45] <eric> ln -s
[01:45] <Pelo> flamsmark, grub did not get installed properly,  I can't realy tell you how to make one from scratch,  and I don'T know how you would go about generating one automaticaly, I suggest you  clean install ubuntu again , seeif that helps
[01:45] <bobhugga> i just bought a new dual core amd x2.  it will be in on wednesday.  my question is right now i have an amd athlon xp and i just did a new fresh install of gutsy.  will i be able to simply plug the harddrive into the new board and have it work, or should i just reinstall it?
[01:45] <LinuxEzGer8> Slart: I think I found something.  Mind checking it out and giving me your insight?
[01:45] <cyrano> wasme: and right click on nm-applet does not show enable wireless option
[01:45] <Slart> LinuxEzGer8: sure
[01:45] <ikonia> !grub > fflamsmark
[01:46] <Pelo> flamsmark,  you did say it was a fresh install right ?
[01:46] <ikonia> !grub > flamsmark
[01:46] <sethk> ovid, that's a PCI bus designation.

[01:46] <ikonia> flamsmark: what happened to that file from the install ?
[01:46] <cyrano> wasme: i need to change to a faster network...
[01:46] <flamsmark> iknoia, i don't know
[01:46] <amitprakash> Slart, lol some 20 errors thrown on login
[01:46] <flamsmark> it only had about ten seconds to get lost
[01:46] <ovid> sethk is that what's mussing with the install? would the text only install help?
[01:46] <wasme> cyrano: ifconfig shows the wireless device?
[01:46] <LinuxEzGer8> A guy on the forum you linked said he used this and it detected his sound card (exact same one as mine) as a SoundBlaster 7.1 or something, but it works fine
[01:46] <Fezzler> wasme: Got it!  Cool!  Now, can I change the icon?
[01:46] <eboyjr> Thank you, Slart
[01:46] <ikonia> flamsmark: do you have /boot on a seperate partition
[01:46] <extrexm_> net
[01:46] <flamsmark> iknoia, isn't the syntax !grub | somebody ?
[01:47] <flamsmark> ikonia, yes i do
[01:47] <ikonia> flamsmark: no
[01:47] <ikonia> flamsmark: ahhhh
[01:47] <r3n0c> flamsmark, well it appears to load correctly from tty mode when i login, but when i type startx, or gdm, it doesn't load to X
[01:47] <wasme> Fezzler: right click and select 'Properties' ... then click on the icon box thingy
[01:47] <ikonia> flamsmark: your menu.lst should be on your /boot partition
[01:47] <ikonia> flamsmark: ahh you able to verify that
[01:47] <flamsmark> i'm looking on my /boot partiton
[01:47] <Slart> LinuxEzGer8: I would not use that.. not unless you find someone that does use it and thinks it's good
[01:48] <cyrano> wasme: i think so
[01:48] <hallo> hi,i have ext3 on /dev/hdb8,if i enter fixmbr in windows recovery console,will it recover widows's mbr ,boot windows automatically?
[01:48] <Fezzler> wasme:  Cool.  Is there a path to standard icons provided by GNOME or Ubuntu?
[01:48] <cyrano> wasme: it shows eth0 and eth1...
[01:48] <doorknob60> foso u still there?
[01:48] <Fyda> Fezzler: /usr/share/pixmaps/
[01:48] <flamsmark> ikonia there's nothing in the /boot of my / partition, and there's plenty (but no /boot/grub/menu.lst) in my /boot partition
[01:48] <Slart> LinuxEzGer8: there will probably be drivers available sooner or later... or write nasty letters to creative and tell them you'll never touch another creative product if they don't fix this =)

[01:52] <bjbdrgn> Fyda: oh. perhaps that's why it's bugged out ever since i upgraded to gutsy
[01:52] <wasme> cyrano: ah, ok. Good to know if the issue ever comes up again. Thanks.
[01:52] <Fezzler> wasme: so Ubuntu recognizes them when plugged in.  But it was too hard.  I'll just launch with GNOME Icon
[01:52] <Fyda> bjbdrgn: In any case, are you trying to install Beryl? And if so, is there a reason you want to use it instead of Compiz (which ships with Gutsy)?
[01:52] <Pelo> flamsmark,  or ask in #grub but be vary patient
[01:52] <Pelo> g'night folks
[01:53] <Fezzler> wasme: after the command do you think I can pass variables?
[01:53] <Slart> LinuxEzGer8: you can see your version by running uname -a.. worst case.. you'll have to reinstall ubuntu.. but that's a very bad case
[01:53] <bjbdrgn> Fyda: i was using beryl, thought that was the more well-known fork
[01:53] <Fyda> bjbdrgn: Ahh, remember that the dist-upgrader in Ubuntu will disable all your 3rd party repos.

[01:53] <foso> ok
[01:53] <doorknob60> now type ./configure

[01:59] <bjbdrgn> flamsmark: not sure, but the kernel sort of has to be installed, right?
[01:59] <LinuxEzGer8> If I go into terminal, can I just do a "sh" on it?
[01:59] <flamsmark> well, a kernel
[01:59] <flamsmark> but not neccesarily the one i want, bjbdrgn
[02:00] <wasme> Fezzler: tv tuner cards are a little hit and miss for linux support. I'd suggest searching google with the *exact* make and model number your looking for.
[02:00] <Slart> LinuxEzGer8: didn't they have instructions on the creative site?
[02:00] <sethk> ovid, try the text mode install on the alternate cd
[02:00] <bjbdrgn> flamsmark: not sure if it's on the cd, but the linux packages probably have it
[02:00] <Pir8> this might be a silly question, but is there a way to find out the date on which I installed linux on my system ?
[02:00] <Fyda> bjbdrgn: That fullscreen toggling action is now in a plugin called "extrawm" (Extra WM Actions), which is inside compiz-fusion-plugins-extra.
[02:00] <LinuxEzGer8> Slart: In the readme it says I need to have the fully configured source for ALSA and my Linux Kernal
[02:01] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, yes, but it's the same as just running it in the terminal without the sh

[02:01] <Pir8> maddler,  ok :)
[02:01] <bjbdrgn> Fyda: ahh, downloading everything that matched compiz right now
[02:01] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: How do you run something in terminal without sh?
[02:01] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, running it under sh is the default.  As long as the script is marked executable (as in chmod +x) the sh isn't needed, although it doesn't hurt.
[02:01] <brophat> I have / and /home, how big should I make / ??
[02:01] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, you simply type in the name
[02:01] <LinuxEzGer8> sethk: thanks!
[02:01] <doorknob60> hmm foso go to System->administration->synaptic package manager
[02:01] <Slart> LinuxEzGer8: I can't really help you with the alsa source.. I've never messed with that
[02:01] <flamsmark> bjbdrgn, but will it mess things about to install them later?
[02:01] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, if you were to say    sh xyz       it's the same as just typing   xyz
[02:01] <Fyda> bjbdrgn: If you used the standard dist-upgrader I think compiz would have been auto-installed already... maybe not plugins-extra though.
[02:02] <bjbdrgn> flamsmark: not sure, I installed Kubuntu from a server install
[02:02] <flamsmark> bjbdrgn what did you do, apt-get install kubuntu-desktop?
[02:02] <LinuxEzGer8> Slart: Thanks anyway!  And thanks for all your help.  I think Seth wants to take a bite. :D  Sethk: How do I know if I have "configured source for the Linux kernel and ALSA which you want to use for this device driver"?
[02:02] <sethk> flamsmark, no impact on anything later

[02:03] <lucian> what is the proper way to mount an external hd? Im doing sudo mount -t vfat -o rw /dev/sdf1 ./book and it still wont let me write to it without sudo
[02:03] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, obviously if you installed them, then you know they are present.  You can use the synaptic package manager to view what's installed and what isn't.
[02:03] <mular> anyone know how I can fix that, short of formatting?
[02:03] <foso> doorknob60 yeah im installing right now
[02:03] <doorknob60> so install the pythin files then try ./configure again
[02:03] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, by default the kernel headers are installed.  By default the compiler is not, so you'll need:    sudo apt-get install build-essential
[02:03] <foso> ok thanks!
[02:03] <doorknob60> then hopefully it wont give any errors
[02:04] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: I am pretty sure I'm gtg on the Linux (7.10 ubuntu) but the ALSA has me worried.
[02:04] <flamsmark> bjbdrgn, so if i really want a something that works as a server, but i can run a local x usefully on too, would you recommend that?
[02:04] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: ah
[02:04] <Pir8> madman91, check for the timestamp on your /etc/fstab file.
[02:04] <sethk> mular, both the windows install and the linux install will see all partitions.  Windows doesn't necessarily understand the type of a linux partition.  Linux is smarter and understands the types of all windows partitions.
[02:05] <alfermp> hey guys can u recomen some aplication for send and recived fax. I have Ubuntu
[02:05] <mular> sethk, is there anyway I can get it to read / write on that odd partition?
[02:05] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, you may have to install some or all of alsa, but it's not difficult to do.
[02:05] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: is ALSA standard?
[02:05] <sethk> mular, you mean windows?
[02:05] <mular> yup
[02:05] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, yes, on the desktop install

[02:05] <lucian> what is the proper way to mount an external hd? Im doing sudo mount -t vfat -o rw /dev/sdf1 ./book and it still wont let me write to it without sudo
[02:05] <sethk> mular, you can format it as a windows partition, but then of course, linux won't use it for swap
[02:05] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: Sorry to ask stupid questions, but how do I know how much ALSA I have installed?
[02:05] <flamsmark> !alsa
[02:05] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[02:06] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, easiest way is to use synaptic, the gui front end of the package manager.  Installed things have a solid green box on the left, installed things have an empty box (that you can check to install)
[02:06] <ConstyXIV> are there any apps in ubuntu to use your webcam as a security camera?
[02:06] <foso> doorknob60, sending a message
[02:06] <mular> aye I see so no way to "change" it back.. ubuntu still see's it as NTFS and so does windows.. but its partition magic that tells me its a linux swap lol bugger
[02:06] <bjbdrgn> Fyda: thanks, worked fine, and i'm upgraded properly
[02:06] <mular> have so much data on it don't want to format ;(
[02:06] <sethk> mular, if you made it linux swap, the data is most likely already gone
[02:07] <sethk> mular, sounds as if perhaps you didn't actually save the partition change to make it linux swap.
[02:07] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: Should I just install everything ALSA?
[02:07] <fat_rat> --help
[02:07] <sethk> mular, do     fdisk -l       on the disk, see what it thinks the partitions are
[02:07] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, if you have plenty of disk space, then sure.
[02:07] <mular> says ntfs
[02:07] <mular> err wait
[02:08] <mular> /dev/sdb1               1       54426   437176813+  82  Linux swap / Solaris
=== roe is now known as roe_
[02:08] <sethk> mular, ok, windows will see that as unused space.
[02:08] <mular> windows says ntfs - the datas still all there but windows can't see it.. it did at one time but I just formatted and reinstalled windows after a bad idea of just using virtualbox
[02:08] <foso> doorknob60 did you get it?
[02:08] <doorknob60> nope
[02:08] <fat_rat> is there bitchx aviable for ubuntu?
[02:08] <sethk> fat_rat, yes
[02:08] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: I built this machine to just run WoW
[02:08] <kitche> fat_rat: yep
[02:08] <mular> since the reinstall, windows sees it as NTFS unknown file system.. no way to fix that then?
[02:09] <robdig> lucian: for fat filesystem, it defaults the ownership and group to the process...since you're using sudo then i guess it is setting it to root...ls -l would verify. there is an option to set the user and group id for fat...
[02:09] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  So space is not a problem
[02:09] <flamsmark> fat_rat apt-cache search bitchx
[02:09] <fat_rat> sethk: apt-get?
[02:09] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, ok, then just check all of them, make your life easier.
[02:09] <sethk> fat_rat, search in synaptic; I don't remember the exact package name.
[02:09] <lucian> robdig: what is that option. . because i cant use mount without sudo
[02:09] <flamsmark> fine, ignore me

[02:10] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, if it isn't already installed, yes.
[02:10] <doorknob60> brophat: 10-15 gb should do
[02:10] <flamsmark> sethk but i was in there :(
[02:10] <foso> doorknob60, now?
[02:10] <sethk> flamsmark, :)
[02:10] <doorknob60> nothing
[02:10] <Synx_hm> Ack utorrent is stuck in the system tray and i cant get it out, ive tried restarting it and even rebooting, an ideas?
[02:10] <brophat> doorknob60 isn't that kind of large? I thought 500 megs
[02:10] <doorknob60> idk...
[02:10] <robdig> lucian: uid=<value>,gid=<value>
[02:10] <LinuxEzGer8> "This product will only support 64-bit Operating Systems"
[02:10] <bluejay> can someone help me out on installing icecast & mpd?
[02:10] <doorknob60> a lot of programs dont install into home
[02:11] <doorknob60> und in like /usr and stuff
[02:11] <doorknob60> idk
[02:11] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, that's a binary, then.  A 32 bit version must also be available
[02:11] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, which card/driver?
[02:11] <doorknob60> more than 500mb though
[02:11] <T1m0thy> Does anyone know of an unstable repo for Ubuntu or at least one that keeps an up to date version of Pidgin?
[02:11] <lucian> so sudo mount -t vfat -o rw,uid=myusername,gid=myusername /dev/sdf1 ./book ?
[02:11] <foso> doorknob60 im seeing yours but i dont think youre getting mine
[02:11] <doorknob60> weird cuz im not getting yours
[02:11] <sethk> brophat, well, it depends on what you want to install.  You can get the o/s with console support running in about 128 meg, but that's not what most people want.
[02:11] <LinuxEzGer8> Sound Blaster Xfi Xtreme Audio
[02:12] <Vadi> What's the command to re-create the xorg.conf file? Without the questions part.
[02:12] <brophat> sethk if I was gonna do that I would not need this channel haha
[02:12] <foso> doorknob60, basically i was gonna send you the whole error, but it says i dont have libwnck1.0
[02:12] <robdig> lucian: think so, checking to see if they want numeric values (surely they wouldn't...)
[02:12] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, I've heard of many cases where 32 bit is available but not 64, but never the reverse.  The 32 bit driver is out there, somewhere.
[02:12] <lucian> robdig: i hope not because i dont know what my numeric value is or how to get it
[02:12] <doorknob60> sudo apt-get install libwnck1.0     type that in terminal
[02:12] <sethk> brophat, seriously, tell us what you want to install and we can comment more specifically on space.
[02:13] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  What morons.  They did precisely that.
[02:13] <sethk> lucian, robdig, you only need numeric values if you want to use IDs that aren't defined within linux.
[02:13] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  Appears it's only available for 64-bit
[02:13] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, url?  That would be more than just moronic
[02:13] <brophat> sethk I have an 80 gig hd and a 120 gig hd, I want to put / and /home on the 80 and make the 120 one huge partition and call it /home/stuff
[02:13] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, this I have to see.
[02:13] <robdig> sethk: ah, thanks...then lucian you should be good to go
[02:14] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  http://www.linuxscrew.com/2007/09/27/creative-sound-blaster-x-fi-linux-driver/
[02:14] <mats_> problem: When I try to start sound recorder, it says: "Your audio capture settings are invalid. Please correct them in the multimedia settings."...why?
[02:14] <sethk> brophat, that's certainly more than sufficient.
[02:14] <lucian> sethk,robdig: thanks
[02:14] <sethk> brophat, I prefer /usr2, but that's entirely asthetic and has no basis in logic.  :)
[02:15] <brophat> sethk ok now for the big question: how big should I make / ??
[02:15] <LinuxEzGer8> There's posts around of people able to get theirs working
[02:15] <amitprakash> sethk, hey,.. thanks a lot..i fixed the uuids and now i can boot in.. tho i think most of my permissions are messed up
[02:15] <foso> doorknob60 unable to lock the administration directory
[02:15] <amitprakash> sethk, have reversed most of the damage tho
[02:15] <T1m0thy> Why are some images appearing smaller than they're supposed to in Firefox?
[02:15] <sethk> brophat, make the 80 gig drive one partition, and the 120 one partition.
[02:15] <lucian> yay!
[02:15] <LinuxEzGer8> Is it possible to install the factory ones from the CD using CrossOver?
[02:15] <lucian> works
[02:15] <doorknob60> foso never seen that one before, and idk what it means either
[02:16] <brophat> sethk you are saying make the 80 gig like / and the 120 say /stuff ??
[02:16] <bjbdrgn> Fyda: know where compiz settings are stored, for Ring Switcher? I can't seem to set the key macro in Actions
[02:16] <foso> doorknob60 i have libwnck 22
[02:16] <sethk> brophat, yes, that is what I would do.
[02:16] <brophat> hmm ok
[02:16] <foso> it said something about renaming something
[02:16] <doorknob60> foso did it give that error when you tried to do ./configure?
[02:16] <sharsa> ok, i need soundcard help. Intel ALC883 Analog, it is setup, not mute, yet nada, no sound
[02:17] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  How do people get their devices working without the exact driver?
[02:17] <Fyda> bjbdrgn: For Compiz-specific questions I would recommend that you ask in #compiz-fusion
[02:17] <IndyGunFreak> !intelhda | sharsa
[02:17] <ubotu> sharsa: For fixing your Intel HDA sound this page has useful information https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
[02:17] <sharsa> thx
[02:17] <foso> doorknob60 yeah, then it said the other thing about unable to lock when i tried to get it
[02:17] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, in general, they don't, unless the hardware emulates some other more common hardware.
[02:17] <amitprakash> sethk, is it possible to get a list of all the stuff installed on my ubuntu installation
[02:17] <doorknob60> hmmmmm try again? :P idk
[02:18] <sethk> amitprakash, dpkg can list installed packages, yes.  synaptic will show you in a nice UI
[02:18] <kst-> gn.
[02:18] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  And I can't run the 64-bit one?  Is there a way to change to 64-bit mode?
[02:18] <amitprakash> sethk, dpkg -l?
[02:18] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, if you have a 64 bit processor, you can install all 64 bit software.
[02:19] <sethk> amitprakash, right
[02:19] <wardrich> hey
[02:19] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, a 64 bit installation can run 32 bit programs, but it won't work the other way around.
[02:19] <amitprakash> sethk, i would like to get only the package names so that after a clean install i can just do a sudo aptitude install list and get away with it.. is that possible?
[02:20] <foso> doorknob60 thanks for your help, ill keep messing
[02:20] <doorknob60> kk
[02:20] <sethk> amitprakash, yes, it's possible to script it.
[02:20] <Tripfx> anyone have problems installing limewire?
[02:21] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  Just scoured the documentation that came with my chip.  Can't find anything about bits.  How can I check what bits I have?
[02:21] <KI4IKL> I installed kubuntu-desktop to kinda try it out, and then decided I didn't like it so I apt-get removed kubunu-desktop...yet all the kde apps are still installed
[02:21] <amitprakash> sethk, will try.. thanks
[02:21] <IndyGunFreak> Tripfx: try frostwire, but most likely the problem is you don't have java installed.
[02:21] <fat_rat> Tripfx: nope
[02:21] <wardrich> Tripfx: why not use GiFT?
[02:21] <monstermike234> join #math
[02:21] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, it's not the chip, it's the installed software and it's the processor on the mother board.  To run 64 bit, you need a 64 bit processor; AMD is the most frequently used one.
[02:22] <fat_rat> Tripfx: check dependences...
[02:22] <Tripfx> yest thats what it says but I have installed java.  I will try frostwire or gift.  Thanks everyone
[02:22] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, if you have a 64 bit processor, you can install the 64 bit version of ubuntu, and then use the 64 bit driver.
[02:22] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  System Monitor says:  Processor:  AMD Athlon (tm) 64 x2 Dual Core Processor 5600+
[02:22] <wardrich> Gift will run in a terminal window
[02:22] <wardrich> it's pretty light weight, but it does the rick
[02:22] <wardrich> *trick
[02:22] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, ok, good, so it's 64 bit dual core, which is very powerful
[02:22] <LinuxEzGer8> SNAP SON!
[02:22] <IndyGunFreak> Tripfx: most likely if limnewire isn't working, frostwire won't..., yu probably don't have the proper java environment installed.
[02:22] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, but you need to install 64 bit ubuntu to take advantage of it.
[02:22] <LinuxEzGer8> How do I set everything to 64-bittles?
[02:22] <LinuxEzGer8> crap
[02:23] <Tripfx> is gift as easy as limewire?
[02:23] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, sorry about that, but you install one or the other.
[02:23] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  How do I go about doing that?
[02:23] <wardrich> it's pretty straight forward
[02:23] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, an ubuntu install doesn't really take all that long.  Besides, you'll do it much better the second time.
[02:23] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, you download the 64 bit cd
[02:23] <IndyGunFreak> Tripfx: its a CLI program if i recall... so you  make the decision
[02:23] <wardrich> run giftd -d, then run giFTcurs
[02:23] <wardrich> http://www.nongnu.org/giftcurs/
[02:24] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  If I have no cd to write to, what would you suggest?  I have LiveCD for 7.04
[02:24] <Tripfx> let me try.  I'll check back if I have a problem.
[02:24] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  Also, I'm assuming I will need to redo the video card driver?
[02:24] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, 7.04, and 7.10, are both available in 32 bit and 64 bit versions.
[02:25] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, well, once you reinstall the o/s, it will stop complaining that it needs the 64 bit o/s.  You have to reinstall _everything_
[02:25] <flamsmark> so, i'm using a gigabyte n680-sli dq6 motherboard which has an onboard sata raid controller. to this are attached three large hard drives (the system drive is separate, on another sata controler on the mobo) and in the first sata raid controller mentioned's portion of the bios, it's set to use these three drives as a single beautiful raid-5'd volume. why then, do i perennially see the drives as three separate objects in the
[02:25] <flamsmark> os?
[02:25] <flamsmark> seriously? os gets truncated?
[02:25] <flamsmark> fine, be that way
[02:25] <T1m0thy> Does anyone know of an unstable repo for Ubuntu or at least one that keeps an up to date version of Pidgin?
[02:25] <sethk> flamsmark, you need to configure the kernel to recognize the RAID 5 setup.
[02:26] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  Okay, so I have LiveCD 7.04.  How do I tell it to install the 64-bit version and subsequently update to 7.10 64-bit?  Also, do you know if the nvidia drivers that I currently have are supported in 64-bit?  And lastly.... Thank you so much.  You are my hero.  :D
[02:26] <KI4IKL> I installed kubuntu-desktop to kinda try it out, and then decided I didn't like it so I apt-get removed kubunu-desktop...yet all the kde apps are still installed
[02:26] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, as far as I know, you don't tell it, you simply use the 64 bit cd to install 64 bit, and the 32 bit cd to install 32 bit.  You'll have to burn that cd somewhere.
[02:26] <amitprakash> #join #ubuntu-india
[02:27] <IndyGunFreak> KI4IKL: lol, you're gonnna spend a LONG time uninstalling those apps..
[02:27] <sethk> amitprakash, /join, not #join
[02:27] <doorknob60> if u need to just remove them individually
[02:27] <amitprakash> yeah :X
[02:27] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  Can I download it to my HDD, say on the desktop, and run it from there?
[02:27] <KI4IKL> IndyGunFreak, but why wont kubuntu-desktop unstall them all?
[02:27] <doorknob60> idk...
[02:27] <KI4IKL> thats kinda BS
[02:27] <IndyGunFreak> KI4IKL: well, if you'd used aptitude instead of apt-get, it would have..
[02:27] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, you can do that with packages, but not with the initial install.
[02:27] <doorknob60> idk if this will do anything but try sudo apt-get autoremove
[02:27]  * Peregrino says Hi!
[02:27] <IndyGunFreak> KI4IKL: it is..., but its the way apt-get is designed.
[02:27] <Nostahl> how do i get ndisgtk in ubuntu
[02:27] <doorknob60> might take em off
[02:27] <KI4IKL> IndyGunFreak, what aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop?
[02:27] <Nostahl> i dont see it in synaptic
[02:27] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, you can set up a 32 bit/64 bit cross compiler and rebuilt the kernel in 64 bit mode, and then install all the 64 bit packages.
[02:28] <dany> alguien puede hablar bien carjo jajaja seguro ni me entienden
[02:28] <nickrud> KI4IKL, you can get rid of the great majority with apt-get remove libqt3-mt
[02:28] <IndyGunFreak> KI4IKL: won't work at this point, because you didn't aptitude install kubuntu-desktop
[02:28] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, it's a bit tricky to set up if you haven't worked with gcc in cross compilation configuration.
=== u^A is now known as u^A_
[02:28] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: Just flew that one over my head
[02:28] <Peregrino> Is there anybody willing to help? ^_^
[02:28] <flamsmark> sethk - shouldn't my hardware be presenting itself as a single volume?
[02:28] <IndyGunFreak> nickrud: thats a good idea, didn't think of that.
[02:28] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, it's not difficult, it's just buzzwords.
[02:28] <sethk> flamsmark, not always.
[02:28] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  Can you guide me, or is it pretty involved?
[02:28] <Fyda> !es dany
[02:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about es dany - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[02:29] <robdig> Peregrino: maybe...what's your question
[02:29] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, I can try to guide you.  It's hard to say whether we would succeed because I don't know how much you already know and how brave you are.
[02:29] <Peregrino> regarding user passwords ion Ubuntu 7.10
[02:29] <flamsmark> sethk - your suggestion, would that make the kernel see the volume, or are you suggesting a software raid setup?
[02:29] <wardrich> Anybody here know much about wireless?  I'm on a dell Inspiron 1501, and I've gotten as far as getting the Wifi light to turn on... and it can find the SSID's, but I can't for the life of me get it to connect... is there something I can try typing in the CLI?  All I've really been able to try is the networking app that came with Ubuntu
[02:29] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: Very brave, very unknowledgable
[02:29] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, seriously, it's not dangerous, because if you mess up, you reinstall.
[02:29] <ricanelite_> anyone here plays Urban terror?
[02:29] <sethk> flamsmark, no, not software raid.
[02:29] <IndyGunFreak> !ask | Peregrino
[02:29] <ubotu> Peregrino: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:30] <sethk> flamsmark, there are RAID controllers that do the right thing (that is, present the thing as if it were one physical disk), but not all of them do so.
[02:30] <theRealBall|away> hi is anyone good with accounting 101 ? i need help please PM me
[02:30] <T1m0thy> Why are some images appearing smaller than they're supposed to in Firefox?
[02:30] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  I am putty in your hands.
[02:30] <sethk> flamsmark, what can happen is that the o/s uses a fallback driver with very basic IDE (or SATA, in this case) functionality.
[02:30] <flamsmark> sethk - so you suggest that there's some way for me to persuade my kernel to see the full volume, say like installing a driver for the full volume?
[02:30] <theRealBall|away> help out a fellow linux user eh
[02:30] <Nostahl> what is the root password for ubuntu 7.10
[02:30] <T1m0thy> Whatever you set it to.
[02:30] <Peregrino> okey! Well, I would like to remove the password for my user account on Ubuntu 7.10 (or at least remove the propts for it), but I don't have the least Idea how to do it :S
[02:30] <Zok|> guys, I need lil help .. I got new, fresh installed Kubuntu distribution, and I can't compile :/ .. I got error message: Can't find X libraries .. anyone who can help me please ?
[02:30] <robdig> Nostahl: there isn't one
[02:31] <sethk> flamsmark, right, by installing a driver that is aware of the chipset your board is using to implement raid.
[02:31] <IndyGunFreak> !root | Nostahl
[02:31] <ubotu> Nostahl: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[02:31] <sethk> flamsmark, if you tell us the chipset we can be more specific.
[02:31] <flamsmark> n680sli
[02:31] <Nostahl> what package do i download to get ndisgtk
[02:31] <amitprakash> sethk, how do i run gnome network applet from konsole?
[02:31] <IndyGunFreak> Zok|: for kubuntu help, join #kubuntu
[02:31] <brophat> sethk would there be any benefit to having it in the /home dir?
[02:31] <flamsmark> sethk n680sli, and i'm checking nvidia's site
[02:32] <IndyGunFreak> Peregrino: you're not going to find anyone here that will tell you how to do that.
[02:32] <flamsmark> sethk though i did mention the chipset initially
[02:32] <sethk> amitprakash, generally speaking, you don't.  I think there is an adapter to do so with kde, but not at the CLI.
[02:32] <flamsmark> sethk :p
[02:32] <amitprakash> okay :)
[02:32] <sethk> flamsmark, well, I'm getting old and forgetful.  Plus this channel has about 200 messages a second (or so it sometimes seems)
[02:32] <ricanelite_> anyone plays games on linux?
[02:32] <T1m0thy> Does anyone know of an unstable repo for Ubuntu or at least one that keeps an up to date version of Pidgin?
[02:32] <leviatan> hi! I have a question: how can I have mp3 archives reviews with nautilus? i can preview just ogg and wav files
[02:32] <doorknob60> i play some games on linux
[02:32] <IndyGunFreak> T1m0thy: just compile it, it doesn't take long
[02:32] <flamsmark> sethk i concur
[02:32] <T1m0thy> I don't, ricanlite_, I do use Steam on my desktop.
[02:32] <Peregrino> IndyGunFreak: Why? Forgiveme if that's not legal :S I'm just bored of entering my pass over and over again
[02:33] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, I don't think we can do it in traffic.  Join #temp102.  anyone else who may be interested can also join.
[02:33] <T1m0thy> IndyGunFreak: I've had problems with compiling Pidgin.
[02:33] <IndyGunFreak> Peregrino: its not that its illegal, its a security issue
[02:33] <IndyGunFreak> T1m0thy: like what?
[02:33] <gradin> what is that damned runlevel update command in debian?
[02:33] <T1m0thy> IndyGunFreak: Like, not having the tray image or no sound when im-ing.
[02:34] <flamsmark> sethk, and from the nvidia site, where, as soon as i select nforce, it jusmps to my chip, and linux, responds with 'No downloads were found for your configuration.'
[02:34] <IndyGunFreak> T1m0thy: those sound like settings sisues, not compiling issues.... i've compiled pidgin many times with no such issues.
[02:34] <Ttech> Hi,  I need help, I want to play dvd's I innstalled the libdvdcss2 lib but it still won't play.
[02:34] <Ttech>
[02:34] <T1m0thy> IndyGunFreak: Okay.. Well, should I sudo apt-get remove the current Pidgin before compiling the new one?
[02:34] <sethk> flamsmark, I had a machine last week where I had to use the driver from nvidia's web site because of a very new card.  The distro is always a bit behind, because they have to take nvidia's driver, turn it into a package, test it, etc.
[02:35] <Peregrino> IndyGunFreak: But isn't there a setting like "don't propmt for passord" or  a setting in witch I enter my pass only one and Ubuntu takes care anytime it needs a password?
[02:35] <doorknob60> timothy: wouldnt be a bad idea
[02:35] <IndyGunFreak> T1m0thy: here's what i would do, sudo apt-get remove pidgin... let that finish, then sudo apt-get build-dep gaim  install all that crap,
[02:35] <IndyGunFreak> then compile
[02:35] <IndyGunFreak> Peregrino: no
[02:35] <flamsmark> sethk - though it seems like i'm out of luck
[02:35] <T1m0thy> IndyGunFreak: Thanks. :)
[02:35] <foso> doorknob60 Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
[02:35] <foso> installed software in a non-standard prefix.
[02:35] <IndyGunFreak> T1m0thy: np, it should compile pretty easily after you do those two commands..
[02:35] <foso> doorknob60 Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
[02:35] <foso> installed software in a non-standard prefix.
[02:36] <doorknob60> foso idk what that means either lol
[02:36] <foso> crap
[02:36] <sethk> flamsmark, possibly.  I would try installing the most recent nvidia driver regardless of what it claims to support.  It may work.  The one from the repos would probably work also, if you could convince the installer to use it.
[02:36] <amitprakash> if my nm-applet is unable to get a hold of my nics.. what permissions are missing?
[02:36] <ricanelite_> im having a pretty hard time wondering why i can't get urban terror or enemy territory running right
[02:36] <foso> anyone know what the error i just pasted mean?
[02:36] <Peregrino> IndyGunFreak: Geez, I think I'll have to get used to type my password over and over again :P But in the LiveCD you don't have to enter any Password :/
[02:36] <leviatan> how can I preview mp3 files? someone could tell me pls?
[02:36] <sethk> flamsmark, you can also use the   nv   driver (the open source, 2d driver) until the 3d driver is updated.
[02:36] <doorknob60> oooh do sudo apt-get install build-essentials is u havent already foso
[02:36] <IndyGunFreak> Peregrino: sounds like it.
[02:37] <ricanelite_> like when i use the mouse to look around it locks up for a second and then it is fine and when im looking around again it locks up again
[02:37] <sethk> Peregrino, you can set it up to not have to use the password.
[02:37] <flamsmark> sethk - but was we recall, this is not a graphics but a raid driver
[02:37] <sethk> flamsmark, oh, yes, sorry, got confused.
[02:37] <Peregrino> sethk: how?
[02:37] <sethk> flamsmark, let me check that chipset.
[02:37] <flamsmark> wahoo! i have bootage, or booty, or what-have-you. it looks like my other hard drives were right royally confusing the grub installer
[02:37] <flamsmark> sethk - yes sir
[02:37] <foso> doorknob60 couldnt find the package
[02:37] <novas0x2a> how do i change a package's status from installed to auto-installed?
[02:37] <sethk> Peregrino, what are you doing specifically where you need to type the password?
[02:37] <foso> doorknob60 should it be in the desktop/avant in the terminal?
[02:38] <doorknob60> tthat command doesnt really matter
[02:38] <leviatan> I think I need a library to preview mp3 files, but I don't know wich one.... someone can helpp me pls?
[02:38] <nickrud> Peregrino, you can set the timeout of your password , visudo and add the line timestamp_timeout <num> 15 is the default
[02:38] <doorknob60> levi: what do u mean by preview them?
[02:39] <Peregrino> sethk: Mhhh, Let's se... today I installed Ubuntu, and I was prompted at least 6 times for it...
[02:39] <leviatan> doorknob60 If I put the cursor over a ogg i can heard the file, but I can't do it with mps files
[02:39] <sethk> flamsmark, take a look at http://hardware4linux.info/system/1423/
[02:39] <doorknob60> hmm i didnt even know you could do that with any files....
[02:39] <doorknob60> idk
[02:39] <sethk> Peregrino, if you can't be specific, I can't tell you how to turn off the password requirement
[02:40] <IndyGunFreak> Peregrino: what you're asking to do is 1.  not-safe, 2. stupid.. and i would caution you about following the advice of anyone that tells you how to do it.
[02:40] <doorknob60> well i gotta go eat dinner be back later
[02:40] <leviatan> yes you can hehe but i don't know how to do it with mp3 files
[02:40] <leviatan> doorknob60 ok

[02:40] <wardrich> Anybody here know much about wireless?  I'm on a dell Inspiron 1501, and I've gotten as far as getting the Wifi light to turn on... and it can find the SSID's, but I can't for the life of me get it to connect... is there something I can try typing in the CLI?  All I've really been able to try is the networking app that came with Ubuntu
[02:40] <Peregrino> IndyGunFreak: Okey, You know, this wquestion came up to me just a few minutes ago, and I was doing just some research before really doing anything ;)
[02:41] <IndyGunFreak> Peregrino: well, google is your friend..
[02:41] <leviatan> how can I preview mp3 files? someone knows?
[02:41] <flamsmark> sethk - that looks pretty decent
[02:41] <flamsmark> sethk - though abunch of other things are plaing up now :(
[02:41] <sethk> flamsmark, definitely encouraging
[02:41] <Peregrino> IndyGunFreak: Yeah! You can be sure about it, but sometimes I like some human feedback :P
[02:42] <leviatan>  how can I preview mp3 files with nautilus? someone knows?

[02:43] <mats_> how come i can't record in sound recorder? I can hear what I play from my speakers...(guitar)? No matter what source I choose to record from, I still get no recorded sound...
[02:43] <Zombie> This is probably why my initial upgrade failed.
[02:43] <flamsmark> sethk - so that site lists the hardware on the system, and those individual pages list the modules needed to run that hardware?
[02:44] <Highlife> anyone know how i can fix that?
[02:44] <leviatan>  how can I preview mp3 files? :(

[02:46] <IndyGunFreak> ticked: yes.
[02:46] <Xacarith> Does any one know where linux programs store their settings so that you can transfer then instead of having to set up programs like even Xchat again and again
[02:46] <ticked> indyGunFreak....good news or bad???
[02:46] <ivan> Xacarith: your home directory
[02:46] <crispexi> Xacarith, probably in your ~/
[02:46] <ivan> the hidden .dot files
[02:46] <crispexi> for xchat its ~/.xchat
[02:46] <IndyGunFreak> ticked: well, i've used it 3x, 1x it worked, 2x it didn't.. but i don't think it was the programs fault.
[02:47] <remote_matrix> sethk buddy u remember the fan problem i was having (cpu fan) not coming on?
[02:47] <IndyGunFreak> ticked: what do you need it for?
[02:47] <ticked> IndGunFreak, i have windows on a harddrive and linux on a harddrive,k windows is on C: I think i am gonna have to format windows soon and i am worried about killin Grub
[02:48] <FLUxXxX> hello! i've removed splash and quiet from grub's kernel line so i only have text. now i'm trying to get a proper resolution (1280x800 would be perfect) but i don;t know how to do this. While googleing i found something about framebuffer but i don't know if that's what i need or how to use it. help?
[02:48] <IndyGunFreak> ticked: yeah, you'll definitely kill grub if you do that.
[02:48] <ticked> yeah i was hopin Super Grub Disk would be able to save my bacon
[02:49] <IndyGunFreak> ticked: it might, but there are ways to reinstall grub from the Ubuntu Live CD's, although I'm not real familiar with it.
[02:49] <gaurdro> ticked: when you reinstall windows unplug the other drive and the SGD should repair things for you.
[02:49] <Dr_willis> !framebuffer
[02:49] <ubotu> If you would like information on framebuffers, please visit: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrameBuffer
[02:49] <ticked> guardro SGD?
[02:49] <gaurdro> super grub disk
[02:49] <ticked> ahhhh
[02:49] <ticked> cool
[02:50] <Dr_willis> FLUxXxX,  its neabled by default you can use 'vga=ask' in the kernel options to test out the different res's at boot time.
[02:50] <tony_math> Highlife: Check your ssh configuration file /etc/ssh/ssh_config and make sure that StrictHostKeyChecking is commented out.
[02:50] <ticked> guardo, so i am guesing i should unplug drive with ubuntu, do what i gotta do with windows, then plug the drive back in and use sgd?
[02:50] <gaurdro> the important thing is make sure you're linux disk is unplugged when you install windows again.  if windows is feeling cranky i've seen it annihilate both boot records. and/or format the linux dirve
[02:51] <sethk> remote_matrix, yes
[02:51] <sethk> remote_matrix, what's the answer?
[02:51] <AFDerrick> Question for those of you out there.  I am new to Ubuntu and wanting to give back to the community (code), any suggestions where I can go to start with this?
[02:52] <Highlife> tony_math: Yes it's checked out
[02:52] <ticked> gaurdro thats what ubuntu did to me first time i tried partitioning c: and installing windows on c and ubuntu on d:   thus the second drive
[02:52] <ovid> ubunut install locks up on hardware config, earlier the error message was: "cannot allocate resource 0 on 000:00:000

[02:53] <amitprakash> sethk, if my network isnt working.. any ideas what permissions got changed during the copy?
[02:53] <IndyGunFreak> tofaffy: did you get your prob w/ limewire worked out?
[02:53] <remote_matrix> sethk well sir, no answer yet... i kinda got more clues was wondering if u could help?
[02:53] <Highlife> guardo: I'm getting: RSA host key for 192.168.0.104 has changed and you have requested strict checking.Host key verification failed.
[02:54] <tofaffy> IndyGunFreak, yeah
[02:54] <Highlife> everytime i try to connect to an xubuntu machine on my network
[02:54] <sethk> amitprakash, that's really very hard.  See if there is any useful info in the logs.  try /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog.
[02:54] <tofaffy> IndyGunFreak, you have good memory, it's been a long time since that problem
[02:54] <amitprakash> Highlife,either somenes done an attack,, or the server chaged his key
[02:54] <tony_math> Highlife: As a last resort, you can delete your .ssh folder in your home directory. rm ~/.ssh. You should be prompted to accept all keys again.
[02:54] <sethk> remote_matrix, ok, but give me a few moments to finish up a phone call.
[02:54] <IndyGunFreak> tofaffy: it was just like 10-15min ago wasn't it?..lol..
[02:54] <Xacarith> Does any one know where linux programs save their settings?
[02:54] <gaurdro> highlife: have you connected to it when it was running another opperating system.
[02:54] <tony_math> Highlife: that should have been rm -rf ~/.ssh
[02:54] <Highlife> no
[02:54] <amitprakash> Highlife, remove ~/.ssh/known_hosts
[02:55] <Highlife> well yes
[02:55] <sethk> tony_math, he might be able to get away with deleting only   ~/.ssh/known_hosts.  If that doesn't work, he can always delete the rest.
[02:55] <Highlife> and it worked
[02:55] <tony_math> That's true sethk.
[02:55] <Xacarith> Already tried copying the home folder over...
[02:55] <remote_matrix> sethk take ur time lemmie know when ur done
[02:55] <gaurdro> each operating system will generate it's own set of keys so change in operating system=keys change error
[02:56] <Highlife> amitprakash and tony_math remove these from the computer im trying to connect to
[02:56] <Highlife> or the one im using to connect?
[02:56] <Ganjistus> i install Sidbuntu
[02:56] <Ganjistus> i hope it works
[02:56] <amitprakash> Highlife, the one u are using to connect
[02:56] <tony_math> Highlife: remove the .ssh folder from the computer you're using to connect. The computer where you're typing "ssh...."
[02:56] <source> time
[02:56] <nickrud> sidbuntu?
[02:56] <Ganjistus> yeah debian sid sources on ubuntu
[02:57] <nickrud> what's the point?
[02:57] <Ganjistus> i have no clue what i do
[02:57] <Ganjistus> i just do that to gain experiences
[02:57] <nickrud> that's a good point :)
[02:57] <doorknob60> brb -.-
[02:58] <sethk> Ganjistus, not necessarily a bad idea, if you don't mind reinstalling in case you need a stable box.
[02:58] <IndyGunFreak> don't think i've ever heard of it.
[02:58] <Highlife> thank you tony_math and amitprakash
[02:58] <Highlife> it works now
[02:58] <amitprakash> sethk, wow.. there are like a million entries there ^^
[02:58] <sethk> amitprakash, always.  search for error (case insignificant)
[02:58] <Ganjistus> i think i can manualy "downgrade" to stable packets
[02:58] <flamsmark> sethk - what are these 'modules' of which they speak
[02:59] <amitprakash> sethk, found the error already :D and fixing it
[02:59] <tony_math> Glad to help Highlife!
[02:59] <IndyGunFreak> Ganjistus: i would find that pretty unlikely
[02:59] <sethk> flamsmark, a module is a piece of the kernel that can be loaded after boot.
[02:59] <amitprakash> sethk, btw how many years of linux exp do u have?
[02:59] <sethk> amitprakash, I had 20 years of unix experience before linux existed, so a lot.
[02:59] <Ganjistus> try and error or something
[02:59] <amitprakash> sethk, wow
[02:59] <nickrud> ah, another old man
[02:59] <Xacarith> As much as I like linux, this is one of my issues with it, that programs install parts in so many places...  The other is permissions.  It's bad when you can't change sub folders in folders you own...
[03:00] <Ganjistus> sethk are you a unix developer so?
[03:00] <sethk> Ganjistus, yes.
[03:10] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  Still around?

[03:16] <Fezzler> Is irssi worth the time to learn vs Pidgin?
[03:16] <xzased> I was passing some files to an external drive
[03:17] <xzased> I didnt ownload any updates
[03:17] <IndyGunFreak> Fezzler: two different beasts.. Pidgin is a great IM program, but a horrible irc client, look at xchat, xchat-gnome, irssie, kvirc, or several others for irssi.
[03:17] <ryantmer> Fezzler: Pidgin is nice, as it also has other IM clients built in
[03:17] <nickrud> Fezzler, anything is better than pidgin for irc, check out ircssi and xchat as well (not xchat-gnome)
[03:17] <IndyGunFreak> xzased: hmm, thats it?... that doesn't make any sense.
[03:17] <flamsmark> how can i get the sata_nv module?
[03:17] <ryantmer> But I use XChat myself

[03:18] <jepler> that helped me find the search term I needed..

[03:19] <xzased> is there any way to restart the x server?
[03:19] <Fezzler> nickrud:  typo - by me or u
[03:19] <nickrud> Fezzler, me, ircssi was supposed to be irssi
[03:19]  * IndyGunFreak shutters at irssi.. ;)
[03:19] <Fezzler> someone said irssi and "screen" and a powerful combo.  What does "screen" provide?
[03:20] <Fezzler> IndyCar: Why?
[03:20] <IndyGunFreak> i need a GUI.., but thats just me..
[03:20] <WACD> hi...
[03:20] <WACD> I need help with my monitors
[03:20] <nickrud> Fezzler, I don't use screen, although I've played with it. It gives you several terminals in one, you can leave something running in it, close the terminal, and reconnect later for example.
[03:20] <IndyGunFreak> WACD: ask..
[03:20] <Fezzler> Brickyard: Ah, I like to play and learn with my Ubuntu PC

[03:40] <amitprakash> crdlb, only problem is how do i get output from dpkg -l to a format i can paste to the command
[03:40] <LinuxEzGer8> Hello!
[03:40] <foso> crdlb my bad that is the ring switcher
[03:40] <crdlb> amitprakash: I really don't think that would work
[03:40] <staykovmarin> is it normal not to be able to format to ntfs, or is it something i am doing? i am using gparted, and the ntfs choice is grayed out
[03:40] <scguy318> ogre: Network Manager, but you really can't add it to the Apps menu
[03:40] <crdlb> foso: then turn off Ring Switcher, and Enable Shift Switcher. They use the same bindings by default
[03:40] <foso> oh
[03:40] <LinuxEzGer8> So I burned the 64-bit version of 7.10 to a CD, and when I try to boot off the CD, it locks at the menu screen.  Please advise.
[03:40] <scguy318> I've a question. I'm trying to get a Plustek Opticpro 4831p parallel port scanner to work, SANE says it's fully supported, but when I press the scan button in XSane, I get failed to start scanner: invalid argument message.
[03:40] <foso> crdlb can i change the shortcut and use either?
[03:40] <WACD> and then after that i log out... restarted X... but when I log in...my secondary screen went to sleep n will never work after that... no matter how many time i restart my computer "screens and graphics" will not work...n few mins ago I just opened in terminal n at the end it tells me index error...
[03:40] <crdlb> foso: yes
[03:41] <darklordveynom> how do i set my runlevel to 3 and kill X so i can install my nvidia drivers
[03:41] <WACD> so can anyone help me please...?
[03:41] <scguy318> LinuxEzGer8: burn your CD slower
[03:41] <scguy318> LinuxEzGer8: might be a bad burn
[03:41] <robdig> ogre: think it is nm-applet
[03:41] <foso> crdlb can you show me how?
[03:41] <foso> *tell

[03:41] <hwilde> ever seen the loopback address just disappear?
[03:41] <hwilde> ever seen the loopback address just disappear?
[03:41] <amitprakash> crdlb, T_T is there a way to make a list of packages i need on my next install to mirror how my old installation was?
[03:41] <foso> crdlb thanks!
[03:41] <speeddemon8803> !repeat
[03:41] <LinuxEzGer8> Man, it just took me 20 minutes to burn it.  :(
[03:41] <ubotu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[03:41] <scguy318> darklordveynom: what instructions are you follwing? Ubuntu technically doesn't have the concept of a runlevel
[03:41] <winkman> darklordveynom: just a sec
[03:41] <nickrud> darklordveynom, run levels 2-5 are all identical, not redhatisms here, log into a console and sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop

[03:42] <neo123> hi this is salwae
[03:42] <darklordveynom> im just following the instructions on the nvidia website
[03:42] <WACD> does anyone know what can I do...?
[03:42] <speeddemon8803> I can say one thing, I have used ubuntu since october 06..and have never had problems.
[03:42] <scguy318> darklordveynom: ah, then do what nickrud said
[03:42] <LinuxEzGer8> Whatr would you say a good speed is?
[03:42] <sugapisset> Hey, I have troubles with recording in all programs...just tried audacity...won't work...
[03:42] <wers> if i remove one panel, will it use less resources? :)

[03:43] <nickrud> scguy318, you can still use inittab with upstart if you like , for example different roles with different runlevels
[03:43] <crush_groove> crdlb, what do I need to give ya the url #?

[03:43] <hwilde> after a reboot the local loopback address is missing.  I have to run ifconfig lo up.  It is specified in /etc/network/interfaces.  why would his happen?
[03:43] <WACD> well please anyone help me...?

[03:45] <suttles95> I have a dumb question...how can I tell if I'm using Gutsy Gibbon 7.10 32-bit or 64-bit?
[03:45] <crdlb> crush_groove: ah that's easy to fix, run: sudo  nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals -d 24
[03:45] <ronnie> nickrud: oh~
[03:45] <crdlb> crush_groove: then restart X
[03:45] <Filefl1> i just did a fresh install of gutsy from both a pressed cd and one i've burned... both times, when the system is sitting idle, it has load averages above 1.5 ...this happened only after the fresh install, my old ubuntu install on the same machine wasn't doing this
[03:45] <[Mr]_Still> hm
[03:45] <KDuB> How do i mount a .cue or .bin file?

[03:46] <[Mr]_Still> ok
[03:47] <poeticrpm> suttles95, kind of lame way, but check the about section of firefox
[03:47] <scguy318> KDuB: fuseiso
[03:47] <crdlb> crush_groove: you can, but you can also just restart your X server (ctrl+alt+bksp will do it)

[03:47] <nickrud> poeticrpm, won't work here, I run a 32bit firefox ;p

[03:48] <jahnkeanate1> where can i get a driver for a lexmark 4300
[03:48] <nickrud> scguy318, have you tried scanimage , see if that works?

[03:49] <nickrud> scguy318, looking at an alias I haven't used in years, something like scanimage --mode Grayscale --resolution 300dpi
[03:49] <jahnkeanate1> is it possible to print with a lexmark 4300
[03:49] <CoasterMaster> xzased, ahhh....does it leave you with a login prompt?

[03:49] <CoasterMaster> xzased, hmmm, that's strange....I'm not too sure then, sorry :(
[03:50] <nickrud> scguy318, it's in sane-utils I think
[03:50] <ogre> scguy318:  im trying to get rid of that panel & run it off AWN with an applet. the only thing i dont have is nm-applet
[03:50] <xzased> Thanks, there is not much documentation on how to solve this
[03:50] <j1solutions> are there 'drivers' for linux?
[03:50] <poeticrpm> suttles95, did that show you? There should be an "about gnome" section under system, and a section in the system monitor
[03:50] <suttles95> poeticrm:  in System Monitor, it shows Processor:  AMD Sempron 3000+
[03:50] <KDuB> psh

[03:51] <KDuB> thank you
[03:51] <scguy318> suttles95: uname -a
[03:51] <poeticrpm> im on kde and when i open the control center, it has a "Machine" entry that says x86_64
[03:51] <scguy318> nickrud: I'm aware, thanks
[03:52] <jahnkeanate1> can wine run vista programs
[03:52] <poeticrpm> gnome should have the same in the "about gnome" section
[03:52] <suttles95> scguy318:  what do you mean by uname -a?  do I type that in terminal?

[03:52] <jahnkeanate1> ok
[03:52] <scguy318> nickrud: scanimage: sane_start: Invalid argument
[03:53] <poeticrpm> that will tell you suttles95, good to know
[03:53] <speeddemon8803> Winkman why would you want to as older versions are buggy and have major issues.
[03:53] <winkman> Ttech: because the new firefox has stopped my keyboard from functioning properly within firefox
[03:53] <christos> hey im using a x1300 radeon graphics card and cant use desktop effects in 7.10 even with the restricted drivers enabled any solutions?
[03:53] <jahnkeanate1> where can i find ppd files
[03:53] <jmak> can someone help me with a bizarre message when i plug in a flash drive?
[03:54] <Ttech> Winkman: I'm not sure if that is an actual ff issue?

[03:54] <jmak> it says invalid mount option
[03:54] <nickrud> scguy318, well, it worked well in 2004, I used it in an openoffice macro to scan receipts into my expense reports. But I don't see it in the options now either
[03:55] <doorknob60> foso?
[03:55] <winkman> Ttech: would you know of another reason? I've lodged a topic here, but i can't find any solutions... it's only happening in firefox. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3961327

[03:57] <nickrud> scguy318, I remember now, it was a device option that I found with scanimage --help --device
[03:57] <winkman> Ttech: got any ideas?
[03:57] <crispexi> oh i see, thanks Filefl1
[03:57] <haymaker> if i plug in a usb flash drive, i get a message about invalid mount option, and then if i use sudo mount /dev/sdb1 it mounts fine

[03:58] <sethk> haymaker, we need the exact message, not "a message about"

[03:59] <winkman> Ttech: It only enters one keystroke per second... even if i type much faster
[03:59] <doorknob60> hey foso, u there? if so i know how to get the program to work
[03:59] <winkman> nothing else is running, and it's only affected in firefox
[03:59] <Ttech> remove and reinstall firefox?
[03:59] <haymaker> sethk, it says "Cannot Mount Volume.  Invalid mount option when attemtping to mount the volume."
[03:59] <Joe_Dirt> Filefl1, I have tried nmap, I must be doing it wrong because it's not finding ports that I know are open.

[04:00] <nickrud> lol

[04:00] <christos> hey im using a x1300 radeon graphics card and cant use desktop effects in 7.10 even with the restricted drivers enabled any solutions?
[04:00] <haymaker> sethk, so i guess my question is how can i modify the default mount options that flash drives use to automount
[04:00] <Filefl1> Joe_Dirt: i don't know how to use it exactly :)
[04:00] <winkman> Ttech: I can give it a try, i tried to re-install, but didn't remove it first...
[04:01] <sethk> haymaker, that lives in the udev configuration because it's a hot plug event.  See if there is an entry for sda1 in /etc/fstab, and, if so, what the options are that are being used there.
[04:01] <borndeer> Everyone using Google Desktop on ubuntu ? How can i install GoogleCalendar gadgets?
[04:01] <ToddEDM> hey guys, i got a problem.... i try to open a webpage in firefox, but it never opens, just goes white, then i hit refresh and THEN it comes up....... any ideas???

[04:02] <speeddemon8803> todd...yeah lol
[04:02] <ToddEDM> hwilde: huh?
[04:02] <wers> will it use less resources if I remove one of the two panels? :)
[04:02] <speeddemon8803> clear all private data in firefox
[04:02] <hwilde> ToddEDM, clear all private data it is like in the menu
[04:02] <speeddemon8803> tools
[04:02] <ToddEDM> ohh
[04:02] <speeddemon8803> clear private data
[04:03] <hwilde> all of them tho check all the boxes
[04:03] <haymaker> sethk i see, the entry for sdb1 is udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec
[04:03] <Joe_Dirt> Could someone suggest a simple port scanner.
[04:03] <SeveredCross> nmap.
[04:03] <Filefl1> lol
[04:03] <haymaker> sethk, this is because i dont have a cdrom on the machine, so i can just remove it from fstab?
[04:03] <Filefl1> sorry :)
[04:03] <ToddEDM> cool thanks guys.... whats the reason behind that ?
[04:03] <soldats> namp
[04:03] <sheng> hey, i am encountering problems emulating wine

[04:03] <soldats> nmap*****
[04:03] <Guest039> I want to copy the same file to 6 directories all named lab{1-6}Fall07

[04:04] <RoAkSoAx> Joe_Dirt nmap*
[04:04] <sheng> is it possible to run itunes
[04:04] <sheng> using wine?
[04:04] <haymaker> sethk, yah that worked.
[04:04] <SeveredCross> sheng: Probably, but why would you wanna do that?
[04:04] <paradox> hello.
[04:05] <sheng> cus i tried
[04:05] <winkman> sheng: Check the appdb on winehq.com
[04:05] <sheng> to sync
[04:05] <sheng> with amarok and it doesn't work
[04:05] <Ttech> winkman: you good at apt?
[04:05] <hwilde> !enter | sheng
[04:05] <ubotu> sheng: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[04:05] <SeveredCross> sheng: Have you tried using Rhythmbox or Banshee?
[04:05] <wers> speeddemon8803: so that means, removing the other panel makes my computer faster, right? :)
[04:05] <NoiseBO1> So what to do when adding a module to the blacklist does not prevent it from loading at boot time?
[04:05] <Joe_Dirt> RoAkSoAx, I actually tried nmap but I think I don't know how to use it  Because it's not finding open ports that I know are open.
[04:06] <hwilde> wers, a tiny fraction of a second faster yes.
[04:06] <deCon> for some reason, my desktop background has taken over -- as in it doesn't display my menu bars...help!?!?!
[04:06] <RoAkSoAx> Joe_Dirt how you using it??
[04:06] <wers> hwilde: so it's not worth it?
[04:06] <sheng> yes, i tried both of these, and they messed up my playlist. now i have no songs on my ipd
[04:06] <hwilde> wers, personal preference I guess
[04:06] <wers> ooh
[04:06] <wers> I prefer two panels but I want to make my computer as fast as possible
[04:06] <wers> hehehe
[04:07] <LordLuke> .cannabischat.com
[04:07] <hwilde> wers, then run icewm it is lightweight window manager.  gnome is more complex
[04:07] <deCon> Can someone please help me fix my desktop -- it hid my menu panels???????????!!!!!!
[04:07] <SeveredCross> sheng: Okay then. It should be possible to run iTunes, yeah...Just install Wine, download iTunes setup. Double-clicking it should actually run it, I think newer versions of wine use the binfmts support in the kernel to add a hook for the .exe format.
[04:07] <nova> anyone else having problems with gutsy saving their res?

[04:07] <polywaffle> chessdb is the current replacement to SCID, the chess database program for linux.  Wondering if anyone is going to make a deb file for installation of this software as it is the most functional current successor to SCID
[04:07] <SeveredCross> If it doesn't run fine when you double-click, then open a terminal, cd to wherever you downloaded iTunes setup and run wine iTunes-Setup-Filename.exe.

[04:08] <poningru> deCon: now type in gnome-terminal
[04:08] <speeddemon8803> right click it and click unmount pradox
[04:08] <sethk> deCon, one easy thing you can do is delete the gnome state directory under your home directory.  That will return you to the way things were the first time you ran the desktop
[04:08] <polywaffle> anyone with into on chessdb?
[04:08] <sethk> deCon, of course, you'll lose any changes or additions you made after that point.
[04:08] <paradox> Thank you Severed Cross. I can't believe I didn't see that.

[04:09] <sethk> deCon, what you probably mean is how do you get to a console?
[04:10] <deCon> poningru: kk is that what i have to do everytime? is F9 or a mouse 3 connected to this by default somehow?
[04:10] <RoAkSoAx> Joe_Dirt: maybe the host is rejectin the nmap scan using iptables so that's why you cant see any ports open or like it says, the host seems down
[04:10] <paradox> question: how come I wasn't able to see my external HD in /mnt or /tmp/media in xubuntu?
[04:11] <crush_groove> crdlb, .. ty vm ..anyway you can tell me in a snapshot how you knew whart that was ,, just experience or is a glxfb issue always the vidcard and I can reset it by reconfiging x?

[04:16] <j1solutions> LinuxEZ: you can confirm that your file is intact after your download
[04:17] <Joe_Dirt> RoAkSoAx, I'll try to connect to it though
[04:17] <ushimitsudoki> fannagoganna: I don't know about that. When I tried to install from the regular CD, I only got a blank screen, so I never got that far on the regular install method.
[04:17] <haymaker> ok, i installed ubuntu from a flash drive because i have no cdrom for this laptop.  now i need to make synaptic and apt work, cause they think it is a cdrom, so my source media /cdrom/ when it tries to install.  how can i tell it to use /disk/ or something
[04:17] <RoAkSoAx> Joe_Dirt: if you can access a shell into that host, do an nmap localhost and that way it will show the open ports, because that hosts seems to be rejecting packets from wan side and that's why it shows host seems down, it is a security measure

[04:18] <Joe_Dirt> RoAkSoAx, Sounds good,I'll give it a try.

[04:18] <twobits> looking to install linux for the first time
[04:18] <AzureLight> And what about Frets on Fire? It runs REALLY slow for me
[04:18] <ushimitsudoki> fannagogana: I am a newbie, and this is my first install, so it is quite possible someone else may have better advice. Just giving you my experience
[04:18] <HolyAvenger> And the debian channel I used to go to, died. =(
[04:18] <LinuxEzGer8> I'm really starting to get frustrated.  I'm approaching the 24 hour mark of trying to get this set-up.  XP is looking more and more attractive...
[04:18] <fannagoganna> oh ok
[04:18] <sethk> fannagoganna, you can use a kernel argument to override the default driver choice.  Help at the boot prompt should have some info about that.
[04:18] <speeddemon8803> I have no clue about that one.
[04:18] <fannagoganna> all righty, will do

[04:25] <rodneykk> i pooped a tape recorder
[04:26] <doorknob60> hmm 732 fps aint that good
[04:26] <LinuxEzGer8> sethk: Currently yes
[04:26] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, yes
[04:26] <irreducibilis> Along with Pentium IV 1500 Mhz and a Nvidia 5500
[04:26] <doorknob60> i get over 2000 and my vid card isnt that great
[04:26] <nickrud> Nemesis02, you have several issues, but to start, make sure you have no sources other than ubuntu ones installed. Then run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:26] <Cubexombi> <doorknob60> better than my 430
[04:26] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, it's normally intelligent enough to do the right thing.
[04:26] <doorknob60> somethings probly wrong with ur drivers
[04:26] <LinuxEzGer8> sethk:  are there settings I need to manipulate for it?
[04:26] <AzureLight> And what's with that first output?
[04:26] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: if you choose open with cd/dvd creator
[04:26] <AzureLight> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[04:26] <LinuxEzGer8> bazhang:  that's what I've been doing
[04:26] <DipsetSkateHxc> I try to install it on a previously partitioned hdd and it tells me there is no root file system.  So i dont knwo what to do after that
[04:26] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, it may be that there are problems associated with using a cd/rw instead of a cd/r.
[04:26] <AzureLight> Something is wrong with my drivers
[04:27] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, I'll give you the command I use to burn (from a terminal window):
[04:27] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: then it may be the media; do you have a blank cdr you can try it on?
[04:27] <irreducibilis> Could someone compare the Nvidia Fx5500's specs with the ATI x600?
[04:27] <irreducibilis> I am not famillier with ATI cards
[04:27] <LinuxEzGer8> sethk:  I'll look.
[04:27] <LinuxEzGer8> bazhang:  I'll look
[04:27] <Nemesis02> nickrud, i can't do dist-upgrade till i fix the issue with tzdata affecting apt-get
[04:27] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, cdrecord -vv whatever.iso
[04:27] <nickrud> Nemesis02, true, doh
[04:27] <ogre> bazhang: what im trying to do is get rid of all panels & just run everything off AWN the only thing i need is to get a working nm-applet in my <system folder
[04:28] <doorknob60> i can run glxgears inside konversation in the konsole tab on my fx5200 in a sec
[04:28] <doorknob60> as soon as FoF is done installing
[04:28] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, whatever.iso being the file you downloaded.  The -vv isn't necessary but gives you lots of info while it's burning, so use it.
[04:28] <bazhang> most of the problems with a bad iso burn have to do with either a)bad media b)burn speed or c)not matched md5 sum LinuxEzGer8
[04:28] <Jay-Oh-En> whats the name of the program to unrar files in ubuntu
[04:28] <doorknob60> i just use winrar in wine lol
[04:28] <bazhang> ogre: not sure--kde user here :}
[04:28] <AzureLight> Oops
[04:29] <AzureLight> Didn't mean to exit Pidgin
[04:29] <nickrud> Nemesis02, sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/tzdata<tab>
[04:29] <sherl0ck> Jay-Oh-En, unrar
[04:29] <Jay-Oh-En> sherl0ck: does it have a gui
[04:29] <sherl0ck> so im looking to get involved more in ubuntu, where should i begin??
[04:29] <nickrud> Nemesis02, did you just do an upgrade from one version to another?
[04:29] <Nemesis02> nickrude, option -i is unknown
[04:29] <speeddemon8803> involved how?
[04:29] <doorknob60> rofl i just did glxgearas and got 58 fps :P
[04:29] <speeddemon8803> helping?
[04:30] <doorknob60> i have waaaay too many progs running
[04:30] <bazhang> Jay-Oh-En: just clicking on the first file in a rar archive will put it back to gether
[04:30] <ogre> ok guys, what im trying to do is get rid of all panels & just run everything off AWN the only thing i need is to get a working nm-applet in my <system folder. can anyone tell me how?
[04:30] <AzureLight> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[04:30] <AzureLight> 4723 frames in 5.1 seconds = 930.765 FPS
[04:30] <AzureLight> My FPS is going up now
[04:30] <Nemesis02> Nickrud, i did an upgrade from dapper to edgy, but what affected it was install libapache2-fastcgi from the debian repository.
[04:30] <Jay-Oh-En> bazhang: ?
[04:30] <crush_groove> ogre ,.. why not just use fluxbox is you want a clean dt?
[04:30] <sherl0ck> Jay-Oh-En, u want file-roller
[04:30] <irreducibilis> I wonder how much help I can be though... I run all my games in Windows
[04:30] <AzureLight> But that first output tells me something
[04:30] <Jay-Oh-En> sherl0ck: perfect thats what i was looking for
[04:31] <Cubexombi> AzureLight, it tels me that even with broken drivers your's still works better than mine
[04:31] <LinuxEzGer8> I do believe the disc is too small
[04:31] <Nemesis02> Nickrud, i was trying to install ispcp omega, a webhosting control panel that's the offshoot of VHCS.
[04:31] <nickrud> Nemesis02, oh, did you read what I said about repositories other than ubuntu above? REMOVE them, apt-get update, and try again
[04:31] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: if the iso is 696mb and the disk is a 700mb disc, is that too small?
[04:31] <Nemesis02> nickrud, yes i did.
[04:31] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: if it is a cdrw it may have other stuff still on it
[04:31] <soldats> no
[04:31] <AzureLight> Does anyone know what " Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0"." means?
[04:31] <irreducibilis> LinuxEzGer8: 696 < 700
[04:32] <nickrud> Nemesis02, ok, and dpkg -i is one of the fundamental commands, used it many times
[04:32] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, might be a problem, yes.  You should run a blank on it first.
[04:32] <Cubexombi> AzureLight: What Vid card you got?
=== NETabuse is now known as NET||abuse
[04:32] <doorknob60> there i closed programs and got 1686 fps in glxgears on my geforce fx5200
[04:32] <doorknob60> lol compared to 58 with progs open
[04:32] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: ATI Radeon X600
[04:32] <Nemesis02> Nickrud, "E: Command line option 'i' [from -i] is not known."
[04:32] <LinuxEzGer8> bazhang: it does. It had the previous copy of the iso, however when I tried to do the cdrecord, it didn't record.  It filled the screen with stuff and went right back to the cursor.
=== Ashfire is now known as Ashfire908
[04:32] <Nemesis02> nickrud, woops my bad
[04:33] <Cubexombi> AzureLight: can you pastebin your xorg.conf?
[04:33] <nickrud> Nemesis02,  ;)
[04:33] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: Uh... how exactly?
[04:33] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: I've created plenty of drink coasters in burning iso files--you may want to get a stack of cdrs handy :}
=== malakhi_ is now known as malakhi
[04:33] <Nemesis02> Nickrud, yeah, didn't see it also copied and pasted sudo apt-get in front also lol.
[04:33] <tanker_> is any body taking to me ?
[04:33] <LinuxEzGer8> bazhang:  Guess it's unavoidable.  PJs coming off, jeans going on.  To the store with me.
[04:33] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: are you sure your null cdr is null?
[04:33] <bazhang> tanker_: not sure--should we be? :}
[04:34] <Cubexombi> you can alt-F2 and "gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" then go to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and paste it there..
[04:34] <Nemesis02> Nickrud, thanks that fixed the problem, you were a lot of help :)
[04:34] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie:  eh?
[04:34] <crush_groove> how do you clear history in term ?
[04:35] <bazhang> tanker_: if you have a question--ask away :}
[04:35] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: what is "eh" mean....
[04:35] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie: I didn't understand
[04:35] <tanker_> ok,
[04:35] <Berto> Is anyone else's flashplugin32 working badly after the update?

[04:35] <crush_groove> mine in konq Berto
[04:35] <Farquad> i have a dumb question, everytime my computer starts i have to run this command ($ORACLE_HOME/bin/isqlpluscti start) .. how can i get this command to run when my computer starts?
[04:35] <HolyAvenger> I have some issues which, I believe, are related to GNOME (or X). I installed x window and Xfce. Everything was working perfectly fine
[04:35] <crimsun> known issue on amd64.
[04:35] <nickrud> Nemesis02, you probably still have some mixed debian packages in your system, the origins button in synaptic will let you check
[04:35] <HolyAvenger> then I uninstalled xfce and installed Gnome
[04:35] <tanker_> it's nice ,
[04:35] <bazhang> Berto: that should be fixed now--plenty of folks were having problems with that :}
[04:35] <Cubexombi> <Berto> depends what you mean.. My audio skips like a scratched CD
[04:35] <HolyAvenger> now Most windows won't load
[04:36] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  Is it possible to create a second partition with my LiveCD, DL the ISO on that partition, then install it to the first partition and then remove the second?
[04:36] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: i say are you sure your cdr is in the null condition?
[04:36] <HolyAvenger> the default internet explorer wont open
[04:36] <Cygnet> I have a question: If I were to install a new video card in this computer (which has intel integrated graphics) how would I go about telling the computer to use the new card and/or disable the intel graphics?
[04:36] <Berto> bazhang, where would i get that fix?  is there a forum topic
[04:36] <HolyAvenger> and many other windows do not work at all
[04:36] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie:  it's a CD-RW
[04:36] <HolyAvenger> (they just wont open)
[04:36] <rainwalker> bazhang: I pm'ed you
[04:36] <bazhang> !flash | Berto
[04:36] <ubotu> Berto: To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash - Flash 9 is now available in dapper-backports and edgy-backports - See also !Restricted and !Gnash
[04:36] <Cubexombi> Cygnet - if you're lucky you're bios shuld have an option to disable it
[04:36] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: then you have to clean it first
[04:37] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie: define clean it
[04:37] <ronnie> Orz.
[04:37] <ogre> crush_groove:  because I have all my gnome still its just sitting in awn
[04:37] <Cygnet> maybe I should get into the bios and see, then
[04:37] <Berto> bazhang, i already had flash working, and it still works.  I just got an ubuntu update today that makes it more unstable
[04:37] <Cygnet> what if I'm not lucky?
[04:37] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie:  Do I need to format it?  If so, how does one format in Ubuntu?
[04:37] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/48502/
[04:37] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: not format just need clean
[04:37] <twobits> will i have to parition my harddrive myself, or does the installer come with the necessary tools
[04:37] <HolyAvenger> I have some issues which, I believe, are related to GNOME (or X). I installed x window and Xfce. Everything was working perfectly fine, then I uninstalled xfce and installed Gnome and now most windows won't load, the default internet explorer wont open and many other windows do not work at all (they just wont open)
[04:38] <twobits> when i install it
[04:38] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie: as in, erase everything on it?
[04:38] <Cubexombi> Cygnet.. well you may luck out and have a PC that plays nice with 2 cards, some disable it once it's detected, mine doesn't and I hget a kernel panic at boot
[04:38] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: are you useing the nero buner?

[04:39] <DipsetSkateHxc> ?
[04:39] <Wing> Is there any easy way to reload the environment variables from /etc/environment without restarting the damned system?
[04:39] <Cygnet> I'll have to reboot and check what's in my bios then, thanks all
[04:39] <nickrud> HolyAvenger, hm, try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[04:40] <earlmred> is there any way from linux to view what frequence memory is running at?
[04:40] <LinuxEzGer8> well, thanks for your help all.  I'm at 21 hours, 40 minutes of trying to get it to work and I give up.  I'll buy 1,000 CD-Rs tomorrow and try them.  Goodnight.
[04:41] <HolyAvenger> nickrud: I'm on Debian (ubuntu comes from it, as you might already know far better than me) and the #Debian channel (and server) died, so I came here hoping it could be solveable
[04:41] <bazhang> see you tomorrow LinuxEzGer8
[04:41] <Jay-Oh-En> how do i make kubuntu start up in silent mode everytime
[04:41] <Wing> HolyAvenger: #debian is still there.
[04:42] <Wing> HolyAvenger: /join #debian
[04:42] <nickrud> HolyAvenger, ah, I used to run sid and gnome was often broken from packages being out of sync, is that what you are running?
[04:42] <HolyAvenger> in this server? =S
[04:42] <Cubexombi> <AzureLight> you don't happen to have a wacom tablet do you?
[04:42] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: you are so dilligent...
[04:42] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, with an argument on the kernel command line in the grub configuration file.
[04:42] <Wing> HolyAvenger: This server is just an alias to the Freenode network.
[04:42] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: Nope, not at all. O_o
[04:42] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: could you help me?
[04:42] <Cubexombi> <AzureLight> K, just trimming the fat on the xorg.conf
[04:43] <Jack_Sparrow> sethk: Dont you EVER sleep? ...  :)
[04:43] <sethk> Jack_Sparrow, sure, but I can answer questions while I'm sleeping  :)
[04:43] <Farquad> everytime my computer starts i have to run this command ($ORACLE_HOME/bin/isqlpluscti start) .. how can i get this command to run when my computer starts?
[04:43] <Jack_Sparrow> sethk: that explains alot
[04:43] <ogre> ok guys, what im trying to do is get rid of all panels & just run everything off AWN the only thing i need is to get a working nm-applet in my <system folder. can anyone tell me how?
[04:43] <sethk> Farquad, add it to /etc/rc.local
[04:43] <doorknob60> frets on fire doesnt work to well on my comp either....
[04:44] <Farquad> thanks
[04:44] <sethk> Jack_Sparrow, hmm., I'm not sure how to take that  :)
[04:44] <doorknob60> and i got over 2600 fps on glxgears
[04:44] <AzureLight> Doorknob60: really slow?
[04:44] <doorknob60> ya
[04:44] <AzureLight> Odd...
[04:44] <doorknob60> and i got 1.5gb ram
[04:44] <nickrud> old people need less sleep
[04:44] <AzureLight> Ugh... so this is more complicated than is seems
[04:44] <doorknob60> and the lights shine down and arent very transparent and its hard to see the notwes
[04:44] <doorknob60> i suck at it even though i own at GH3 on my ps2
[04:45] <Cygnet> in my bios under video options I've got "primary video adapter <auto>", is that what I'm looking for? (to switch video from intel graphics to new card)
[04:45] <AzureLight> Mine is just REALLY laggy and the notes need to be hit before they even reach the line
[04:45] <AzureLight> Sound is fine though
[04:45] <doorknob60> mines pretty laggy, especially considering my specs
[04:45] <AzureLight> Lower your settings
[04:45] <nickrud> Cygnet, sounds right, should be an option to say pci card, not onboard
[04:46] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: i guess not eh
[04:46] <doorknob60> i lowered mine a lot
[04:46] <sethk> Cygnet, better to explicitly turn it off.
[04:46] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, sorry, I didn't even see your question.
[04:46] <Cygnet> I don't have any options other than auto right now since I haven't obtained nor installed any new cards yet
[04:46] <AzureLight> doorknow60: Set the FoF settings to the lowest you can and see if it's still slow
[04:47] <sethk> Cygnet, ok.  Auto should do what you need (turn it off if another is present), but personally I'd install the new card and then go back in the bios and set the on board video to off.
[04:47] <doorknob60> i set em to lowest except framerate
[04:47] <AzureLight> Hmm
[04:47] <doorknob60> cuz i dont want 1 frame per second :P
[04:47] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: could you help me... do what im trying to do?
[04:47] <AzureLight> Same here, and mine still doesn't work
[04:47] <Jack_Sparrow> Not trying to run fof under wine or anything like that right
[04:47] <Xacarith> Having an issue with packet manager getting to the internet. or something.  Might have something to do with lack of internet connection when installing.
[04:47] <irreducibilis> doorknob60: Frets on Fire looks like crap anyways until you mod it to look like GH
[04:47] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, well, I don't know until you tell me what you are trying to do.
[04:47] <doorknob60> no i dloaded from repos
[04:47] <Cygnet> sethk, ok, thanks :)
[04:48] <AzureLight> I had problems with the repos one
[04:48] <irreducibilis> I have 4 mods that change the notes, backround, fretboard/neck, score counter, etc...
[04:48] <doorknob60> irred:well no point in modding it if it doesnt work right :P
[04:48] <AzureLight> The repos one wouldn't play for me
[04:48] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: to make every startup in silent mode and change the bootsplash screen background
[04:48] <AzureLight> I'd get list index out of range
[04:48] <irreducibilis> I got mine from SourceForge...
[04:48] <Rodri> hola
[04:48] <doorknob60> the repos one played for me but not too well

[04:49] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, There is a quiet argument (on the kernel command line) to turn off most things.  There is another one for complete silence; let me see if I can find it.
[04:49] <Cubexombi> <AzureLight> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/48503/plain/  --> I've added a few options and switches, I'd recommend doing a back-up of your current xorg.conf <in terminal "sudo cd /etx/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup" > then "gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and paste the new xorg over the old. and restart x.
[04:49] <Xacarith> using apt-get update all I get is Reading package lists... Done
[04:49] <Rodri> no se como
[04:50] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: that is all that command does
[04:50] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: i meant so it shows all those text lines on startup i  think its called verbose?
[04:50] <Jack_Sparrow> Rodri: solamente engles
[04:50] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: Alright
[04:50] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, now I'm confused.  You want the lines, or you don't want the lines?
[04:50] <Xacarith> On this computer I get a list of packets it checks
[04:50] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: i do
[04:50] <mikedoty> Rodri:  Necesitas entrar "/join #ubuntu-es", por ejemplo
[04:51] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk:  i want the lines
[04:51] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, ok, go into /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove quiet, both on the kernel line and on a line by itself.
[04:51] <doorknob60> just wondering, what IRC programs do u guys use? i use konversation cuz it owns even though i use gnome
[04:51] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: are you trying to upgrade?
[04:51] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: lol wtf "sudo: cd: command not found"
[04:51] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: thats all?
[04:51] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, yes.  The lines will also be written to /var/log/messages
[04:51] <Cubexombi> <AzureLight> my goof typo
[04:51] <Xacarith> jack_sparrow My other computer comes up with a list of packets checked  Also update manager doesn't come up with any updates, saying my system is up to date.  When I installed from the same CD on this computer I had like 100+
[04:51] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, you can repeat the startup lines with the dmesg command
[04:52] <Cubexombi> sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
[04:52] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, although dmesg has a limited buffer size so old messages are eventually lost as new ones appear.
[04:52] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: are the repos set the same on both?
[04:52] <Reilithion> What command will show me what programs are listening on what ports?
[04:52] <Xacarith> Also the only packets synaptic is loading in is the ones already installed
[04:52] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, but immediately after boot, do:    dmesg > captured-dmesg      to preserve the messages.
[04:52] <Cubexombi> AzureLight sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
[04:52] <Jay-Oh-En> seth i mean like this on startup http://kde-look.org/CONTENT/content-pre1/26409-1.jpg

[04:54] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: did you look at that image
[04:54] <Cubexombi> ctrl+alt+backspace.. if it doesn't restart, sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:54] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, looking
[04:54] <winkman> Hi, i'm just about to wipe my ubuntu system for a complete re-installation- i've used APTonCd to get all the packages, copied over all of my home folder onto my flash drive- would you recommend me doing anything else?
[04:55] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: installing xchat etc is easy.. but please define update the system?
[04:55] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: thats what i want it to look like on startup
[04:55] <Cubexombi> Azurelight if it doesn't restart, sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf will restore your current config
[04:55] <tianshu> Hello? Is Ereryone here?
[04:55] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: You might want to look at synaptic for your package management and enabling the extra repos.
[04:55] <Xacarith> jack_sparrow Your usual OS updates
[04:55] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: I got some warning box saying ubuntu is running in now graphics mode, and now I have a smaller resolution
[04:55] <tianshu> do you know chinese?
[04:56] <nickrud> winkman, sounds like a plan, I'm assuming you're gonna have a home partition on this next install?
[04:56] <tianshu> ?
[04:56] <nickrud> !cn | tianshu
[04:56] <ubotu> tianshu: For Ubuntu help in Chinese : #ubuntu-cn <unconvertable> #ubuntu-tw  <unconvertable> #ubuntu-hk
[04:56] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, The startup scripts for ubuntu and gentoo are rather different.  It is not trivial to get exactly the same display.
[04:56] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, if you prefer the gentoo style, why not just run gentoo?
[04:56] <Cubexombi> AzureLight Hmm..  tahts a little odd I didn't mess with your resolutions.
[04:56] <Xacarith> jack_sparrow I have been just using synaptic packet manager to install xchat...  But when I search for it on the laptop nothing comes up.
[04:56] <tianshu> ?
[04:56] <winkman> nickrud: I'll have the same setup, things have stuffed up with one of my latest updates - (my keyboard is majorly stuffing up in firefox, and speed has dramatically reduced)
[04:57] <wy> tianshu: me. But I can't input chinese right now
[04:57] <Cubexombi> Azurelight you can sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf will restore your old config.
[04:57] <Jack_Sparrow> !info xchat
[04:57] <ubotu> xchat: IRC client for X similar to AmIRC. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.8.4-0ubuntu5 (gutsy), package size 300 kB, installed size 808 kB
[04:57] <nickrud> Xacarith, system->admin->software sources, make sure the first four are ticked, and the cd is not
[04:57] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: well i dont like gentoo and i know you can do this in kubuntu and ubuntu usually you press a key to make it like this on startup to see what things fail BUT i want it like this every    single    time
[04:57] <AzureLight> cubexombi: first, let me try glxgears
[04:57] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: do you have universe enabled?
[04:57] <tubetop> howdy all
[04:58] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: If not... enable it ... then update   then install
[04:58] <tubetop> does ubuntu server come with a active firewall?
[04:58] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, it won't be precisely the same, although it will be close.
[04:58] <AzureLight> Error: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual
[04:58] <tubetop> sorry 7.10
[04:58] <AzureLight> lol
[04:58] <Jack_Sparrow> !firewall
[04:58] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[04:58] <doorknob60> brb
[04:58] <winkman> Joy-Oh-En: I think this is enabled/disabled by using the 'Quiet' option in boot
[04:58] <nickrud> tubetop, no, it's not running
[04:58] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: thats all i want :]
[04:58] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, I'm trying to remember exactly where that switch is.  Hold on a few moments.
[04:58] <AzureLight> What did you do Cubexombi? XD
[04:58] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: thanks
[04:58] <winkman> nickrud: so... this sounds ok?
[04:59] <Cubexombi> Azurelight um not enough to screw that up :) Looks like it doesn't like a few options
[04:59] <prozacmas> has anyone here installed ubuntu using an lvm ?
[04:59] <tubetop> does iptables have a line in init.d or somentin?
[04:59] <nickrud> winkman, yup, that's the basics. I have home on another partition, so I don't need the usb, but what you are doing is the same as I do (for what thats worth :)
