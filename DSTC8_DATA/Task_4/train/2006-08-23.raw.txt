=== acidian [n=acidian@145.80-203-36.nextgentel.com]  has joined #ubuntu
[02:11] <rmd> because you can download a tiny program that will let you access your linux partition, and ubuntu comes with built-in read access on NTFS
[02:12] <Jamminpotato> Phenax, dang ok im so used to needing 8 gigs to be safe with xp, wow, wow, linux rocks
[02:12] <eyequeue> Jamminpotato, don't use ntfs for the shared partition btw
[02:12] <Jamminpotato> rmd, but ubuntu cant right to ntfs can it
[02:12] <mainer> michael__: yes,it's not 100% foolproof,but lists open bugs,done=fixed bugs,listchanges does what it says,you can install via synaptic,downgrade the xorg for a fix
[02:12] <Phenax> Jamminpotato: With other distros I've been able to stick it on less than 100mb, not with much software of course
[02:12] <Phenax> FAT32 can be read and written by Windows and Linux

[02:14] <acidian> I was looking at gaim

[02:14] <michael__> I know a lot of people who prefer xchat though
[02:14] <Jamminpotato> i dont like gaim for irc
[02:14] <michael__> I'll be glad when Gaim gives a final release of 2.0.0
[02:14] <Jamminpotato> how good and fast are the windows tools for righting to ext3? and similarly how good are the linux tools for r/w ing on to ntfs?
[02:14] <acidian> I dont like not having list of people in the channel
[02:14] <acidian> anyway to fix that?
[02:14] <eyequeue> acidian, faim works, but is not featureful for irc, it seems rather clumsy

[02:59] <bruenig> swarm_, mininova has a weird setup whereby it wont allow you to download torrents from links. You have to actually go to its page and then click on it. It wants you to visit its site I suppose in  order to gain ad revenues. For instance, if you were to put that link up on another page and click on it. It wouldn't download the torrent it would automatically redirect you to a page where you click on a link to download it. That might

[03:24] <chris__> not sure what that means lol
[03:24] <Flannel> swarm_: the first 80% mightve been it downloading the torrent file
[03:24] <bruenig> Jordan, doing sudo apt-get -d install whatever, will only download whatever. I don't know where it stores it but it downloads it somewhere
[03:25] <sethk> chris__, that's assuming you installed the package.  you built it, so it's a bit more work than that for gdm to see it
[03:25] <smo> bruenig: most likely /var/cache/apt/archives/
[03:25] <Dev05> Jordan, when you download and intall deb packs, they are in /var/cache/apt/archives.
[03:25] <swarm_> Flannel, nah, it was at 2.8gb of 3.2gb
[03:25] <chris__> whats the apt package to get?

[03:32] <TheMafiaa> I want to install ubuntu on my new laptop, do I download the live cd and install from that?
[03:32] <sethk> danmorg, meaning you don't care if it melts?
[03:32] <lispy> i just found out some versions of ubuntu are still shipping darcs 1.0.5, but 1.0.5 has two rather serious bugs.  http://www.abridgegame.org/pipermail/darcs-users/2006-February/009694.html  who do i contact to let them know they should update the package?
