[09:07] <jacquesmerde> well, its on DHCP
[09:07] <ivoks> jacquesmerde so what?
=== subhankar [~bunty@202.177.162.242]  has left #ubuntu []
[09:07] <karsten> jacquesmerde: Dude.  Static.
[09:07] <ivoks> jacquesmerde u steel need dns
[09:07] <thoreauputic> jacquesmerde, you need your computer's name and IP in the other machines' /etc/hosts
[09:07] <jacquesmerde> ivoks, how do i use this DNS mastery? why doesnt ubuntu do it be default? archlinux does, and it does NOTHING for me by default
[09:07] <ivoks> jacquesmerde u are wrong, man
[09:07] <karsten> jacquesmerde: Ubuntu aims for desktop.  It doesn't install servers by default.
[09:08] <karsten> jacquesmerde: aptitude install bind9 and RTFM.
[09:08] <ivoks> jacquesmerde no software knows what computers are on network
[09:08] <jacquesmerde> thoreauputic, thats hard if its DHCP though
[09:08] <karsten> jacquesmerde: The usual DHCP solution is to provide DNS for IPs, hand them out arbitrarially, and the result is that the hostname doesn't tie to any one computer.
[09:08] <jacquesmerde> ivoks, what i plug in 192.168.1.1 into my browser and look at my routers setup, i can click on "dhcp table" and it shows me a "client hostname" for every computer connected EXCEPT for the ubuntu machine
[09:09] <karsten> jacquesmerde: Which *still* isn't going to solve your problem.
=== fdr [~fdr@62.97.40.10]  has joined #ubuntu

[09:09] <fdr> hello
[09:09] <karsten> jacquesmerde: Hint, and I'm going to whisper this in your ear
[09:09] <ivoks> jacquesmerde ?
[09:09] <cyphase> jacquesmerde, i've had that problem as well. i have to hand set it
=== jowe [~jowe@67-41-229-200.slkc.qwest.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[09:09] <karsten> jacquesmerde: YOU DON'T NEED TO USE DHCP FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING, AND IN FACT, YOU DON'T *WANT* TO USE DHCP FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING.  FIND AN IP _OUTSIDE_ THE LEASE RANGE, AND ASSIGN IT TO YOUR BOX.
[09:09] <jacquesmerde> cyphase, hand set it as in manually set the IP? or set the IP manually on each connection
[09:10] <karsten> jacquesmerde: You've been rambling on this crap for hours.  Last clue, dude.
[09:10] <c-sic> hi:)
[09:10] <cyphase> jacquesmerde, i had to hand set a hostname. the IP address was already set
=== freewoody [~bill@202.79.52.59]  has joined #ubuntu
[09:10] <jacquesmerde> karsten, yeah, i figure that's my contingency plan. but somehow what i'm wanting to do seems so basic i feel i shouldnt need to

[09:10] <IIIEars> ah
=== karsten ignors jacquesmerde
[09:10] <ivoks> he's trying to say that all windows machines provide their hostname to dhcp server
[09:10] <ivoks> but ubuntu doesn't
[09:11] <ivoks> i guess
[09:11] <ivoks> :)
[09:11] <karsten> ivoks: That's WINS, not DNS.
[09:11] <jowe> I'm having trouble getting the driver working for my wireless...:( any ideas? I'm not sure if I found the real driver for windows. I guess I need the bcmwl5.inf one.
[09:11] <jacquesmerde> ok, let me put my question in one final form: what are the keywords related to what i'm trying to understand here, so i can google and RTFM
[09:11] <ivoks> karsten no, no...
[09:11] <karsten> jowe: Talk to metalsand
[09:11] <karsten> ivoks: yes yes yes.
[09:11] <ivoks> karsten when u bring up dhcp server
[09:11] <jacquesmerde> jowe, my computer uses that .inf
[09:11] <ivoks> karsten and it starts to give leases
[09:11] <karsten> ivoks: ... Default Windows name resolution order is WINS, then BIND.
[09:11] <ivoks> karsten usually it writes something like:
[09:11] <karsten> ivoks: Your host announces itself to the network via WINS.  That's how it's found.
[09:11] <jowe> jacquesmerde - do you know where I can download the .inf?
[09:12] <Fahim> morgning.. somebody here who speaks german?
[09:12] <karsten> Fahim: Nur ein bisschen.

[09:15] <stuNNed> Seveas: ah ok thanks
[09:15] <fdr> Seveas, : yeah, I did that, but I can only find 2.6.10 and 2.6.11
[09:16] <karsten> stuNNed: Unless I'm grossly mistaken (and this is a posibility), your typical Windows LAN nameservice is *WINS*, *not* DNS.
[09:16] <jacquesmerde> ivoks, am i REALLY an idiot?
[09:16] <jowe> metalsand, yeah for ubuntu (well, kubuntu I guess.)
[09:16] <Seveas> fdr, apt will not show it if you're on hoary, but you can download the deb from archive.ubuntu.com
[09:16] <ivoks> jacquesmerde yes
[09:16] <ivoks> :))
[09:16] <stuNNed> karsten: unless WINS is disabled i would guess
[09:16] <karsten> stuNNed: Now that's an empirically testable hypothesis.
[09:16] <ivoks> jacquesmerde go to /etc/dhcp3 dir
[09:17] <Seveas> karsten, a dhcp client can send a hostname in a dhcp request...
[09:17] <karsten> ivoks: You sure your windows host doesn't have a locally assigned name it's passing on, or that your logging tool isn't assigning it a name based on a WINS IP lookup?
[09:17] <ivoks> jacquesmerde and remove comment "send host-name"
[09:17] <Seveas> no need to use wins
[09:17] <jacquesmerde> ivoks, /etc/dhcpc?
[09:17] <stuNNed> Seveas: how does the dhcp client get the hostname?
[09:17] <ivoks> karsten it isn't about logging tool, it's about dhclient
[09:17] <Seveas> stuNNed, that's set in /etc/hostname
[09:18] <ivoks> jacquesmerde /etc/dhcp3/
[09:18] <Seveas> just the name you gave it upon install
[09:18] <Seveas> or another name if you changed it...
[09:18] <ivoks> jacquesmerde there is file dhclient.conf
[09:18] <karsten> Seveas: DHCP (and also BOOTP with Vendor Extensions) provide a mechanism whereby the server can provide the client with information about how to configure its network interface (e.g., subnet mask), and also how the client can access various network services (e.g., DNS, IP routers, and so on).
[09:18] <karsten> Seveas: From TFM>
[09:18] <karsten> Seveas: ...dhcpd.
[09:18] <karsten> ivoks: What's your logger?

[09:32] <Seveas> IIIEars, very bad idea
[09:32] <metalsand> IIIEars, Rar it into smaller pieces, and create .isos from those?
[09:32] <jacquesmerde> ivoks, why should it make a difference?
[09:32] <IIIEars> Fat 32 XP
[09:32] <Seveas> IIIEars, no eay of doing it
[09:32] <karsten> IIIEars: Move on one system, or move to another location?
[09:32] <jacquesmerde> ivoks, do i put my hostname in "s?
[09:32] <ivoks> jacquesmerde put in ur hostname without .xx.com
[09:32] <karsten> metalsand: man split.
[09:32] <Seveas> fat32 cannot handle files that are bigger than 4 gb
[09:32] <karsten> IIIEars: 'man split'
[09:32] <Seveas> so you're screwed :)
[09:32] <IIIEars> move to an external USB drive
[09:32] <ivoks> jacquesmerde ifdown ethx
[09:32] <jacquesmerde> so "myhost" or myhost?
[09:32] <ivoks> jacquesmerde killall -9 dhclient3
[09:33] <Seveas> IIIEars, usb disks generally are fat32 too
[09:33] <karsten> IIIEars: How big's the file, what's the source of it?
[09:33] <ivoks> jacquesmerde send host-name "imafool"
[09:33] <karsten> Seveas: They can be reformatted ;-)
[09:33] <Seveas> karsten, :o)
[09:33] <IIIEars> Great! - Linux power. - you guys keep feeding it. :)
[09:33] <Seveas> IIIEars, if you format (under windows) your >8gb usb drive into fat32, that's an option
[09:33] <karsten> IIIEars: Where is the image now, what FS, and how do you know it's a valid image?
[09:33] <Seveas> into ntfs i meant*
[09:33] <ivoks> jacquesmerde don't forget ; as a lst latter

[09:37] <Seveas> ish, most likely in a bits/something include file
[09:37] <karsten> IIIEars: the chunks are named bigfile.aa bigfile.ab bigfile.ac ...
[09:37] <karsten> IIIEars: ...and you can cat them back together:  cat bigfile.* > bigfile-new
[09:37] <Seveas> i think stdio.h should include that too, so try including stdio.h
[09:37] <jacquesmerde> ivoks, i'd add a page to the wiki to save people like me a lot of time, but i still dont quite understand what i did

[09:41] <jacquesmerde> ivoks, i have a nameserver, 210.15.254.240
[09:41] <thomo> for some reason fluxbox takes much longer to load than gnome. I know that ubuntu is optimised to start gnome fast (very impressive) but does this affect the speed of other window managers?
[09:41] <thoreauputic> karsten, "badvertised" is a nice typo ;)
[09:41] <ivoks> jacquesmerde so u see, u have nameservers of ur ISP
[09:42] <IIIEars> the dd command got me interested in linux i love it's power. :)
[09:42] <ivoks> jacquesmerde if u put a name in /etc/cups/client.conf it will search that name on couple of places
[09:42] <karsten> thoreauputic: Who says it's a typo?
[09:42] <karsten> IIIEars: It should get you interested in JCL.
[09:42] <ivoks> jacquesmerde first it will look in /etc/hosts to find it there, if it isn't there, it will contact namservers

[09:45] <karsten> IIIEars: dd ~= Norton Ghost.  But for Linux, tar and equivalents are far more useful.

[09:45] <ivoks> jacquesmerde well... right
[09:45] <metalsand> I really wish I got my PCMCIA card set up :(
[09:46] <ivoks> jacquesmerde so u can setup dns on ur router
[09:46] <metalsand> I have a feeling it's going to take a lot of tweaking to get it working
[09:46] <ivoks> jacquesmerde and connect it with dhcp

[09:46] <ivoks> jacquesmerde with dhcp-dns
[09:46] <karsten> metalsand: No, it's going to take one tweak.
[09:46] <ivoks> jacquesmerde well, it isn't simple :)
[09:47] <karsten> metalsand: ...all the other tweaks _won't_ get it working.

[09:49] <metalsand> wlan-ng
[09:49] <ivoks> jacquesmerde i just know it sends public DNS, and they don't know anything about ur local network
[09:49] <Seveas> ah

[09:50] <karsten> IIIEars: I ran into a problem years back on Sun.  IIRC I could either send or receive large (>2 GB) files, but not the other.  Or was it piping output to something else?
[09:50] <metalsand> should I paste in #flood
[09:50] <metalsand> ?

[09:51] <Seveas> iwconfig eth1 commit
[09:51] <metalsand> Now I'm frightened to use WEP using Linux, I don't want to break anything.
[09:52] <jacquesmerde> the latter
[09:52] <thoreauputic> jacquesmerde,  man interfaces
[09:52] <ivoks> jacquesmerde so.. it's allways username@hostname
[09:52] <ivoks> jacquesmerde localhost IS hostname
[09:52] <Seveas> and then try iwconfig eth1
[09:52] <Seveas> and paste the result in a private chat
[09:52] <ivoks> jacquesmerde it's a special hostname, referring to local host :)
[09:52] <metalsand> Seveas: done
[09:53] <ivoks> jacquesmerde in /etc/hosts u need something like:
[09:53] <ivoks> jacquesmerde 192.168.0.2 gaetway

[09:53] <ivoks> jacquesmerde 192.168.0.4 mywindowsbox
[09:53] <jacquesmerde> ivoks, but that's for static IP
[09:53] <ivoks> jacquesmerde etc... then will ping gateway work
[09:53] <ivoks> jacquesmerde u have 4 machines! dhcp is overhead

[10:36] <thoreauputic> leww1, thae other question: kynaptic I think
[10:36] <Razor-X> stuNNed: gonna defrag, then repartition using knoppix
[10:37] <Razor-X> and, the newer versions of NTFSResize don't need to defragment, as I can see
[10:37] <Razor-X> but, it's a safety measure, most definitely
[10:37] <thoreauputic> Razor-X, make some free space for Ubuntu and you should be good to go
[10:37] <yahalom> how do i unzip a .zip file?
[10:37] <Razor-X> thoreauputic: I have
[10:37] <stuNNed> yahalom: unzip file.zip
[10:37] <thoreauputic> yahalom, unzip <filename>

[10:38] <jacquesmerde> my printer server problems are solved, now i just have to solve my little latex problem
[10:38] <Razor-X> i'm hoping that, in the available keyboard layouts, Dvorak is included
[10:38] <Choubaka> should be.

[10:38] <yahalom> thoreauputic, do u use rox or xffm?
[10:38] <thoreauputic> yahalom, rox
[10:38] <yahalom> thoreauputic, cos my rox is weird
[10:39] <thoreauputic> yahalom, I use rox in gnome, too
[10:39] <yahalom> thoreauputic, it displays the icon text off the right

[10:40] <Razor-X> there's a hoary install guide

[10:47] <apax0r> does ubuntu install X so it works from start or do i have to configure X?
[10:47] <Seveas> apax0r, usually it works from start
[10:47] <Seveas> only if you have a really weird card it won't :)
[10:47] <thoreauputic> Funraiser, umm - but is java installed at all?
[10:47] <Funraiser> it is
[10:47] <apax0r> k, i guess that depends on my gfx. :)
[10:47] <ekCo> ok
[10:47] <Seveas> which card do you have?
[10:47] <Funraiser> i installed azureus so java is installed and working

[10:48] <Seveas> apax0r, you might give the nvidia drivers a try too for some performance

[11:16] <sjohnson> jsgotangco: : ok.. cause i'm thinking at least an official handbook would be of IMMENSE help, and this Wiki stuff is pretty ramshackle.. for example, a user should know RIGHT AWAY what to do about setting a root password
[11:17] <p0rnflake> Can someone explain to me why I'm unable to resolve dns names when my /etc/resolv.conf is correct ?
[11:17] <thoreauputic> bob2, you know I don't have any problems with you...
[11:17] <dyno> thanks to ignore my request...

[11:19] <sjohnson> is there an OFFICIAL guide that tells you how to use apt-get properly for this OS?  I can't get w32codecs to install or get recognized using apt-get
[11:19] <sjohnson> the unofficial guide tells me to change around all my files without any explanation whatsoever
[11:19] <bob2> that's the wrong question
[11:20] <Rattboi> thoreauputic: does it have to run in a host window, or can it work within a window manager?
[11:20] <IIIEars> jsgottangco - Will Ubuntu "Breezy" include the no execute "NX" memory flag?
[11:20] <thoreauputic> sjohnson, for w32codecs you'll need the MArillat repos
[11:20] <jsgotangco> not the marillat thing again
[11:20] <jsgotangco> :(

=== Corvus [Corvus@85.86.233.133]  has joined #ubuntu
[11:21] <sjohnson> yeah i read that, but my file (i just installed the OS) is not consistent at all with the repos change advice
[11:21] <thoreauputic> Rattboi, it can run nested or on its own display - it runs better on its own tty ( usually defaults to tty8)
[11:21] <sjohnson> sorry dudes if i'm sounding really pissed off, but tiny thigns like these are really frustrating.. it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence
[11:22] <thoreauputic> sjohnson, is this your first linux install?

[11:23] <jsgotangco> why not just get the tarball from mplayer
[11:23] <bob2> sjohnson: download that file, and run 'sudo dpkg -i w32codecs_20050412-0.0_i386.deb'.
[11:23] <IIIEars> sjohnosn - relax, I have less than two weeks using linux and if i can do it you can too. :)
[11:23] <sjohnson> IIIEars: thanks bro
[11:24] <thoreauputic> bob2, actually I found the "unstable" marillat version works fine: but disabling marillat in sources.list afterwrds seems to solve other issues
[11:25] <bob2> it can make mplayer uninstallable
[11:26] <thoreauputic> bob2, hmm - I installed the multiverse mplayer afterwards: but as I say, I commented marillat out before installing it and after installing the codecs
[11:26] <bob2> yes
[11:26] <bob2> that will work
[11:26] <sjohnson> i think it might be because I'm from Canada, the config files are very different than listed in the UbuntuGuide
[11:26] <bob2> they will be almost identical
[11:26] <thoreauputic> sjohnson, which config files?
[11:27] <Seveas> maybe /etc/apt/sources.list

[11:49] <thoreauputic> sjohnson, if you want to rip mp3 from CD, install grip and lame ( in the multiverse repo)
[11:50] <rudi-rudi> sjohnson: or cdparanoia and lame for console ripping.
[11:50] <thoreauputic> sjohnson, to use sound-juicer for mp3 you'd need gsreamer-lame from marillat

[12:14] <tanek> thats what i have
[12:14] <transgress> orhs: shipit.ubuntu.com  <--awesome
[12:14] <transgress> tanek: how do you like it?
[12:14] <mirak> usb is broken in breezy, the modprobe sd_mod fix the problem for mass storage, however I can't make work my usb printer. Also I have a new usb device called subgar, it's capture video usb card, and I don't know how I can know which module to load
[12:14] <wdh> orhs, check ubuntulinux.com for shipit
[12:14] <airox> Really amazing! :D
[12:14] <tanek> transgress: i like it a lot, it's pretty large compared to the ipod, but the price makes up for that
[12:14] <transgress> mirak: stuff broken in breezy?  you're shitting me.
[12:15] <MattJ> hrmm i just installed muine, and when i play mp3s it says playing, but there is no sound
[12:15] <mirak> transgress: sarcasm forbidden
[12:15] <transgress> no way in hell am i spending that much on ipod when there are cheaper choices...
[12:15] <transgress> mirak: ha!

[12:15] <tanek> transgress: just what i thought when i got mine. and i haven't regretted it
[12:15] <mirak> breaks
[12:16] <mirak> I don't know how the update packages, but that's a big bug to not have been spotted by the packager himself ^^
