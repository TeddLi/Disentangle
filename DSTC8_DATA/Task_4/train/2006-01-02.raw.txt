[11:37] <Seveas> miguel_, vfat knows nothing about permissions, use mount options
[11:37] <coNP> miguel_: fat32 fs cannot handle permissions, so you can change them when you mount them
[11:37] <gnomefreak> did bk find out how to get to #gentoo yet?
[11:37] <flodine> i tryed starting in a terminal but say i dont have root privileges
[11:37] <gnomefreak> flodine, sudo firestarter
[11:37] <Seveas> at least he found his way out of here (I helped him a bit :))
[11:37] <gnomefreak> lol Seveas  ty
[11:37] <cafuego> gnomefreak: I hope not, he's got no business running that if he can't even figure out hwo to change channels on irc.
[11:37] <mebaran151> mwe, really?  So in FAT everything is 777?
[11:37] <freddie> can someone help me with video codes on internet when 1 try too veiw them it closes firefox
[11:37] <mwe> mebaran151: right
[11:38] <nalioth> mebaran151: there are no perms in fat*
[11:38] <mwe> mebaran151: but you can mount it read only if you like
[11:38] <gnomefreak> freddie, i gave you the codecs info already
[11:38] <ompaul> I thought #gentoo was second door on the left after you leave this channe
[11:38] <mebaran151> mwe, or mount it noexec
[11:38] <coNP> gnomefreak: bk seems to ask questions on #gentoo
[11:38] <flodine> gnomefreak if i close the terminal then firestarter closes to
[11:38] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell freddie about codecs
[11:38] <psusi> mebaran151: no, in fact there ARE no permissions... so linux has to fake it... you can tell it what fake values to use when you mount it

[11:39] <ompaul> cafuego, ahhh
[11:39] <fraggsta> does anyone know how to boot the Ubuntu LiveCD on an old (blue&white) ibook? I'm stuck at the yaboot prompt

[11:39] <Seveas> cafuego, and only if USE doesn't feature brain :)
[11:39] <freddie> gnomefreak it maks no sence to me
[11:39] <cafuego> fraggsta: Just hit return (in theory)
[11:39] <gnomefreak> flodine,  you can make a launcher for it on your menu bar so you dont have to use terminal
[11:39] <visik7> will mountlo be added on next ubuntu ?
[11:39] <synmoo> mebaran151: I've tried known good batteries, the bluetooh mouse works ok for a second, then disconnects for what would seem to be no reason

[11:39] <cafuego> Seveas: (hence the decapitation)
[11:39] <rabbit> mwe:  should I enable source repositories too?
[11:39] <Seveas> hehe
[11:39] <fraggsta> cafuego: in theory yes, but in practice I get errors :(
[11:39] <miguel_> yes I have made the ubuntu install and the devices mount was made during this install. The permissions are rwxr-xr-x and even when I try chmod while I am root, I can't change the permissions to get write permissions on that partition
[11:39] <mebaran151> synmoo, but in the end
[11:39] <mebaran151> it's a USB device right
[11:39] <mebaran151> as in

[00:30] <ryorininseven> cafuego: Ooh, ok. So then it just comes down to making a VM for use with it.
[00:30] <bk> i didn
[00:30] <bk> i did
[00:30] <Dr_Willis> bk,  you just downloaded the firefox 1.5 tar?
[00:30] <mirak_> mwe: you installed it in your $HOME ?
[00:30] <bk> i'm giving up on gentoo
[00:30] <thoreauputic> ompaul: you on skype atm ?
[00:30] <bk> i'm back to ubuntu
[00:30] <mwe> ryorininseven: vmware runs without trouble here, though
[00:30] <ompaul> not atm
[00:30] <cafuego> !firefox1.5
[00:30] <ubotu> You can update to firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[00:30] <ryorininseven> mwe: What kernel are you running?
[00:30] <thoreauputic> ompaul: OK
[00:30] <ompaul> but give it a sec
[00:30] <mirak_> bk: gentoo is horrible
[00:30] <bk> but the latest version of ubuntu uses firefox 1.0.7
[00:30] <ryorininseven> mwe: And you're using Hoary or Breezy?

[00:31] <cafuego> bk: See rule 1.
[00:31] <bk> so where should i extract firefox?
[00:32] <Razor-X> mirak_: yeah, it has it's disadvantages
[00:32] <yatesy> bk: whereever you like
[00:32] <I_Am_> it talks about a seperate boot partition

[00:32] <cafuego> bk: And also read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion. I didn't make ubotu post that for no reason.
[00:32] <ryorininseven> mwe: And I've got no mention of any vmware errors in any of the log files, so that's a little distressing.
[00:32] <Dr_Willis> I really dont see whats so impiorntant about fuirefox 1.5 actually.
[00:32] <cafuego> bk: NO. Read the url.
[00:32] <yatesy> bk: sbin is used for superuser processes only
[00:32] <mirak_> Razor-X: at least I tried it :)
[00:32] <I_Am_> when i viewed the grub info it did not say anything about a boot partition
[00:32] <sorush20> when I run glxgears they run fine for a few seconds then it slows really down.
[00:32] <bk> alright, cafuego. i'll read it.
[00:32] <mwe> ryorininseven: auw. that's bad
[00:32] <bk> cafuego, are u a developer?

[00:33] <cafuego> bk: No, just sensible.

[01:33] <Jemt> Greetings. I have a minor problem with Xorg. Every time I logoff and log back into Gnome og Fluxbox, the resolution is set to the maximum allowed resolution (and by that 60 Hz). I just want it to run in 1024 x 768 @ 75 Hz. How can i "hard code" this into a configuration file so it won't change back again?
[01:34] <cmatheson> Jemt: remove the resolutions you don't want from your xorg.conf

[01:35] <Aquatopia> Hi, I'm trying to install ubuntu, the only cdrom I have is a bit broken, but I'm able to start the setup but as soon as it starts installing stuff it dies. Can I install of the internet as is possible with debian?

[01:36] <HurricaneJ> is there a dock for ubuntu that i can use instead of the bottom panel to see what windows are open? i have searched but have not found any info on it
[01:36] <apokryphos> !tell Aquatopia about install
[01:36] <Jemt> Aquatopia: You might get lucky with a 'server' install - after that you can install the rest from the internet.
[01:36] <Aquatopia> apokryphos, thanks :)
[01:36] <apokryphos> HurricaneJ: popular kde ones, at least, are kxdocker, ksmoothdock, and kooldock
[01:36] <john> oh poo, i have killed ubuntu, i enabled the nvidia drivers and got blue screen saying "failed to start x server" on boot....any ideas chaps? please help :(
