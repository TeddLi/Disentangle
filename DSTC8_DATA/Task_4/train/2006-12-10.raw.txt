[09:53] <jw_606> Hello, can someone help me get my internet connection working in wine 9.9? I'm using Ubuntu 6.06
[09:53] <nolimitsoya> kerik, there is a plugin for gnome. rightclick any bar and press 'add'. scroll through for the system monitor. or, you can use the big one- from the system menu
[09:53] <root> Slart: nothing USB connected for me

[09:54] <J-_> following ubuntu guide http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_install_Graphics_Driver_.28NVIDIA.29, trying to get my nvidia driver going, it says, "To use XvMC to accelerate video playback, use the following flags." then a line for xine and mplayer. Do I put both those lines in the file that I just created, or run both in the terminal?
