[07:11] <hiexpo> shazzr, cause i'm smart  lol
[07:12] <rabbitear_sdf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI2fRCrhQSw
[07:13] <hiexpo> i don't think you had right permissions when issuing rmrf command
[07:13] <shazzr> hiexpo: Why would not 'sudo rm -rf [folder]' do the trick from console? Weird that one has to use a GUI to get rid of the folder structure like that...
[07:13] <greenride> hiexpo: I get `Error while deleting.`
[07:14] <F2Knight> don't do : sudo rm -rf /
[07:14] <vonsyd0w> you could have a hardware or filesystem issue
[07:14]  * F2Knight or do do it.
[07:14] <hiexpo> greenride, with gksudo nautilus
[07:14] <greenride> yes
[07:15] <hiexpo> what error greenride
[07:15] <F2Knight> shazzr there is no difference , however try looking at extended attributes. us lsattr to see if any are set
[07:16] <F2Knight> lsattr
[07:16] <F2Knight> -------------e- ./findilo.sh
[07:16] <shazzr> F2Knight: No worries now. The folder is gone. So hiexpo's tip worked.
[07:16] <greenride> hiexpo: Let me verify that I did this correctly. At a terminal, I typed `gksudo nautilus`. Then, I went to the folder in the gui and right clicked. Then, I went to `Move To Trash`. Is that correct?
[07:16] <hiexpo> greenride, yes
[07:16] <F2Knight> still fun to know, you can also set the 'i' or immutable attribute. I do this a lot on things like authorized keys files and such keeps even root from deleting it with out unsetting it
[07:17] <shazzr> greenride: I just did ALT+F2 and typed gksudo nautilus
[07:18] <hiexpo> greenride, it my be a file owner issue
[07:18] <greenride> hiexpo: When I did that, I get the message `Quiz` can't be put in the trash. Do you want to delete it immediately?
[07:18] <greenride> hiexpo: Then, I clicked Delete.
[07:18] <hiexpo> say yes
[07:19] <greenride> Then, I get the error message `Error while deleting.` Could not remove the folder .git.
[07:19] <greenride> If I click, `Show more details`, I see...
[07:20] <greenride> Error removing file: Directory not empty
[07:20] <hiexpo> .git is that a hidden file in your home folder?
[07:20] <greenride> It's a hidden file in the Quiz folder that I'm trying to delete.
[07:21] <F2Knight> if you just want to delete the .git file, use rm -rf .git/
[07:21] <greenride> The folder name is irrelevant. I have another folder with the same problem that errors on a different directory.
[07:21] <greenride> F2Knight: `rm -rf .git` errors with the message:
[07:22] <rabbitear_sdf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=safkWMNJdDg
[07:22] <greenride> `rm: cannot remove .git: Directory not empty`
[07:22] <shazzr> greenride: Dive into the dir and delete all the content that you are allowed to delete first?
[07:23] <shazzr> greenride: My folder was empty except on folde/file
[07:23] <greenride> shazzr: I can cd .git. However, I cannot ls -alh in that directory.
[07:23] <greenride> ls -alh gives me:
[07:23] <greenride> ls: reading directory .: Input/output error
[07:23] <greenride> total 0
[07:24] <F2Knight> greenride are you providing the -rf
[07:24] <F2Knight> because it won't work with out it
[07:24] <greenride> F2Knight: Yes. I am. I realize this is strange because the error message is like I'm not providing it.
[07:25] <greenride> F2Knight: I've used Linux for some time, and I've never encountered this before.
[07:25] <greenride> Oddly, I can `cd .git`, but I cannot run ls -alh in that directory.
[07:26] <shazzr> greenride: Log in to Unity, alt+f2, gksudo nautilus, delete folder.
[07:27] <greenride> shazzr: How do I Log in to Unity?
[07:27] <shazzr> greenride: Well...the default gui in Ubuntu is Unity.
[07:28] <greenride> shazzr: I just tried that, and I described the error messages that I got when doing it.
[07:28] <greenride> Should I post screen shots?
[07:29] <researcher123> how to know processor and graphic card information using command line?
[07:29] <hiexpo> greenride, try this go into your home folder click show hidden files find that folder and try to open it
[07:29] <greenride> researcher123: lspci -vvv
[07:29] <shazzr> greenride: Did you do a alt+f2? Or did you open a terminal window where you wrote 'gksudo nauilus'?
[07:30] <bazhang> sudo lshw researcher123
[07:31] <sebastian_> Hello
[07:32] <greenride> shazzr: I did both, but I did the alt+f2 after you requested. The initial steps were different, but the latter steps and errors were identical.
[07:32] <greenride> hiexpo: When I goto the folders, they open, but nothing is inside.
[07:32] <shazzr> greenride: how about if you try to mv the folder to a different location? Then delete it?
[07:33] <greenride> hiexpo: When I try to ls -alh these folders from the command line, I get errors.
[07:33] <[Saint]> might be worth checking filesystem consistency.
[07:33] <sebastian_> don't working flah player Ubuntu 14.10 Why ?
[07:33] <hiexpo> greenride, how about just ls
[07:34] <greenride> hiexpo: Just `ls` gives
[07:34] <greenride> ls: reading directory .: Input/output error
[07:34] <Ben64> sounds like a dead hard drive
[07:34] <vonsyd0w> definitely sounds like a filesystem/hardware issue
[07:34] <[Saint]> livedistro; filesystem check
[07:35] <[Saint]> sounds like your fs is hosed honey.
[07:35] <greenride> shazzr: I can move the files to a different location, but I can't delete from the new location either.
[07:35] <[Saint]> yeah - sounds like a HW error or a hosed filesystem.
[07:35] <[Saint]> fsck is your new friend.
[07:35] <[Saint]> ...maybe.
[07:35] <shazzr> greenride: Move it to a USB and delete?
[07:36]  * [Saint] sometimes wonders if people just roll a dice or flip through a dictionary to suggest random shit that might work
[07:36] <[Saint]> tried standing on one leg?
[07:36] <[Saint]> singing soprano?
[07:36] <hiexpo> hehe
[07:38] <greenride> shazzr: If I copy to another file system, I can delete it. Let me try fsck
[07:46] <greenride> [Saint]: fsck /dev/sdb1 after unmounting the hard drive fixed those files, which allowed me to rm -rf them.
=== xubuntu is now known as Guest93977
[07:46] <greenride> [Saint]: Thanks for the help.
[07:48] <greenride> hiexpo, shazzr, F2Knight: Thanks for your help. Your advice (and commands to run) probably led [Saint] to suggest fsck, which ultimately worked.
[07:48] <[Saint]> HollllllaaaahhhhhhhhhhH!
[07:48] <hiexpo> kool
[07:49] <greenride> [Saint]: Thanks man
[07:49] <[Saint]> not a problem it just sounded very much like filesystem corruption to me, so I ran with it.

[09:15] <Ben64> DukeDrake_: can you log in as console
[09:15] <Ben64> on console*
[09:15] <DukeDrake_> There were no errors during the upgrade
[09:15] <Seveas> DukeDrake_: log in on the console (ctrl+alt+f1 to go there, alt+f7 to go back). Run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

[09:31] <iskuhdzljsl> I'm currently working off a liveUSB session on a laptop, and woud like to gain access to a Windows drive (Windows is in hibernate) without starting Windows. Lubuntu won't let me mount through the GUI, as it says the drive is in hibernate... but suggests that I should attempt to mount with the read-only flag. I went to /media/lubuntu, but naturally, there's nothing listed there, because the drive's not mounted. How do I mount in
[09:32] <Seveas> iskuhdzljsl: mkdir /mnt/windows; mount -t ntfs-3g -o ro /dev/yourwindowsdrivehere /mnt/windows
[09:32] <phpcoder> Ben64, maybe aproblem with nvidia driver
[09:33] <phpcoder> i do not know
[09:33] <iskuhdzljsl> Seveas - and get the ID of the Windows drive from gparted?
[09:33] <DukeDrake_> Seveas: hmm .. fglrx doesn't seem to be installed at all .... yet when I try to install it via apt-get, it fails with "Unabble to correct problem. You have held broken packages" :(
[09:33] <phpcoder> for example i was listening music on youtube....the system (cursor/keybord) was blocked but i still was listening the music
[09:33] <phpcoder> so it is not a complete "block"
[09:33] <Seveas> iskuhdzljsl: or from fdisk -l
[09:33] <phpcoder> so i am asking if there is a way to check the reason in log file for example
[09:34] <Jakey2> i want to run a batch of sql scripts from a folder does anyone know a script for this
[09:34] <iskuhdzljsl> Seveas - cool. Giving it a shot now.
[09:34] <Seveas> DukeDrake_: the held broken packages thing is a clue that not all went well in the upgrade. Time to get a wired connection and do more apt-get
[09:36] <Avihay_work> Jakey2: maybe you can use your cli sql client, and use xargs, or some bash for loop
[09:36] <zztopless> Just switched from a windows host with a couple of ubuntu guests to a Mint guest with the same ubuntu guests and for whatever reason all TOR traffic on the guests is very slow (fine on the host and fine on the guests if I boot back in to my not-yet-deleted windows7 installation on the host), I mean like ~ 1 MB/s on either host or the guests on the win7 host vs ~30-40k/s tops for the gusts on the ubuntu host.  Any ideas
[09:36] <zztopless> would be much appreciated...
[09:36] <DukeDrake_> Seveas: ok
[09:37] <Jakey2> Avihay_work, looking to do it in bash

[09:42] <DukeDrake_> same error
[09:42] <DukeDrake_> hm

=== Tsunami1 is now known as Guest83427
[09:46] <Seveas> that nc makes it send the output to me. Ordinarily I'd ask to pastebin it, but that's tricky without a webbrowser :)

[10:13] <rahulprodev> trijntje, I think my internet is not working on command line
[10:13] <DukeDrake_> ok :}
[10:13] <DukeDrake_> (is my first issue of this kind ^^)
[10:14] <Seveas> DukeDrake_: apt-get install unity-control-center 2>&1 | nc seveas.net 1234
[10:14] <trijntje> rahulprodev: internet should work just as normal
[10:14] <Seveas> I've had such issues dozens, if not hundreds of times. I tend to break apt horribly or do utterly unsupported upgrades like 9.10 to 14.10 :)

[10:16] <rahulprodev> trijntje, I use wifii, I think it's not connected
[10:17] <DukeDrake_> incoming
[10:17] <rahulprodev> DukeDrake_, :)
[10:18] <Seveas> DukeDrake_: ok now I'm even more confused. It's installed, but not installed at the same time!?
[10:18] <Seveas> DukeDrake_: apt-cache policy unity-control-server | nc seveas.net 1234
[10:19] <rahulprodev> trijntje, I think I will reinstall a window...
[10:19] <DukeDrake_> there.
[10:20] <rahulprodev> trijntje, thanks.
[10:20] <trijntje> rahulprodev: you can if you want, but you can also fix ubuntu
[10:21] <DukeDrake_> (by the way: how can I jump by words on the terminal? (like ctrl+left and ctrl+right on windows))
[10:21] <Seveas> ctrl-left/right should do the trick
[10:21] <rahulprodev> trijntje, I'm not that familiar that much with terminal... Is there any recovery system like windows?
[10:23] <DukeDrake_> (nope ^^)
[10:23] <rahulprodev> DukeDrake_, ok :0
[10:23] <trijntje> rahulprodev: can you see which programs were updated or installed last on your pc? Thats probably the problem
[10:24] <Seveas> DukeDrake_: I'm a bit at a loss I'm afraid, so I want to tackle the problem from a different angle. So first more debug info for me:
[10:25] <Seveas> more /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* | nc seveas.net 1234
[10:25] <Seveas> And then another apt-get attempt: apt-get -f --fix-policy install
[10:25] <Seveas> which will probably fail, if it does, append the ususal 2>&1 | nc seveas.net 1234
[10:25] <DukeDrake_> o.o
[10:26] <nashant> Hey, is there any way I can increase the effective resolution of my display? I want to shrink everything so I can fit more on the screen

[10:32] <DukeDrake_> yeah, well .. I had the 'c' in the command ... I can also see the directory in /etc/apt/ ... errrrr... hmm o.O
[10:33] <Seveas> DukeDrake_: are there any files in there?
[10:33] <DukeDrake_> no Xd

[10:37] <iseon> Hello, has anyone tried to build an ubuntu kernel on Debian? I just tried but had errors.. should it be successful following for example https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile ?
[10:40] <Seveas> iseon: depends on which part of that document you followed. But it should generally work
[10:42] <DReynolds> Does anyone know how to fix the problem "select CD_ROM boot type" with 2 empty options when trying to load ubuntu install cd on intel macbook?
[10:42] <iseon> Seveas: ah actually I followed this step-by-step http://blog.avirtualhome.com/compile-linux-kernel-3-2-for-ubuntu-11-10/
[10:42] <iseon> I think it might be a little out-dated now though.
[10:42] <DukeDrake_> re
[10:42] <Seveas> see the title of that already spells trouble
[10:43] <iseon> Seveas: got any pointers for similar step-by-step example for  ubuntu 15.04?
[10:43] <DukeDrake_> hm
[10:44] <Seveas> iseon: you're trying the 15.04-to-be kernel on debian?
[10:44] <DukeDrake_> "Installed none" with the xserver-xorg-core is really weird
[10:44] <iseon> I'm building the kernel for another computer running ubuntu 15.04 on the Debian machine
[10:45] <Seveas> iseon: ok, so you're building the 15.04 kernel for a 15.04 machine on a debian box? (I really want to make sure I understand you correctly before gicing bad advice)
[10:45] <iseon> Yes, that is correct
[10:45] <Seveas> ok, then I suggest you look at pbuilder
[10:46] <Seveas> on debian you can create an ubuntu 15.04 build chroot with pbuilder and then use pbuilder to build the kernel package. That way you get closest to what Ubuntu itself does.
[10:46] <Seveas> If you need to make changes before building, you can do that on Debian just fine and build source packages (debuild -s) which you then turn into binary packages with pbuilder.
[10:47] <phpcoder> gys is there a log where can i see why my the gui is messed up
[10:47] <iseon> I will check it out, does it mean that I need a full ubuntu 15.04 filesystem on the debian box though?
[10:47] <phpcoder> ?
[10:47] <Seveas> phpcoder: /var/log/Xorg.0.log and ~/.xsession-errors
[10:47] <Seveas> iseon: you need a minimal chroot, which pbuilder will create for you.
[10:48] <iseon> Seveas: very cool, thanks that is super helpful :):)
[10:48] <DukeDrake_> bbl
[10:48] <Seveas> iseon: it caches it compressed, that takes 113MB. During build you'll need a bit more diskspace.
[10:49] <phpcoder> Seveas, thanks!

[11:03] <haskell0_> I think I uninstalled both nouveau and NVidia drivers, now after logging in nothing appears (although I can move the mouse), can I use the live CD to install NVidia drivers?
[11:04] <lotuspsychje> haskell0_: try grub recoverymode/fix broken packages
[11:05] <lotuspsychje> haskell0_: or a terminal from recoverymode and install drivers from there
[11:05] <ioria> haskell0_, never done that, but you can enable  cdrom in  sources.list and add nomodeset in grub
[11:06] <haskell0_> lotuspsychje, I tried recoverymode/fix broken packages, but I keep seeing "Failed to fetch http://..."
[11:08] <lotuspsychje> haskell0_: sudo apt-get update maybe?
[11:09] <lotuspsychje> haskell0_: maybe boot nomodeset as ioria sugests
[11:10] <haskell0_> lotuspsychje, I am able to get terminal access, I used sudo apt-get update, and I see similar "Failed to fetch http..." messages, perhaps I should wget the nvidia driver and install that?

[11:24] <mailsender> Hi ubuntu people, i am having 2 issues with my ubuntu 14.04 .       first i wanted to send mail using php mail() and it did not seem to work. after debugging and installing of some mailing systems, the server was slow so i restarted it. it now will not run a simple "hello world".
[11:24] <mailsender> i looked at netstat and i do not see anything on port 80
[11:25] <mailsender> htop shows apache running and i also restarted apache which showed no error
[11:26] <mailsender> how can i tell if apache is running on port 80?
[11:26] <mailsender> what to look for in the netstat output?
[11:26] <lotuspsychje> mailsender: try an nmap -PN -sV on your ip
[11:27] <mailsender> nmap -PN -sV 172.88.my.ip
[11:27] <mailsender> is this the syntax?
[11:28] <lotuspsychje> mailsender: yes
[11:28] <mailsender> thanks, i am doing it
[11:28] <bekks> mailsender: lsof -i | grep 80
[11:29] <Apachez> any of you who knows if theres a virtual usb driver within ubuntu repositories? that is so I can mount a directory to behave as a usb drive (to then be used as a usb drive for virtualbox for the vmguest to reach)?
[11:29] <mailsender> lsof -i | grep 80 showed nothing
[11:29] <bekks> So nothing is running.
[11:29] <bekks> Did you use sudo?
[11:29] <mailsender> ok thanks
[11:30] <mailsender> ahhh, sudo brings up all kinds of things
[11:30] <mailsender> so if apache is listening on port 80, why can't i run a simple hello world?
[11:31] <bekks> mailsender: firewall blocking issue, routing issue, configuration issue, etc.
[11:34] <mailsender> the thing is i just used that file to test the mail() function and after i rebooted it does not run any php code on the server
[11:34] <mailsender> all i did was installing and uninstalling sendmail, postfix and similar ubuntu mail packages
[11:35] <mailsender> so i do not know which of those actions might have impacted apache
[11:35] <Dumle29> I just did a fresh install of xubuntu on an older laptop of mine. Sound over the headset jack works fine, but sound over the internal speakers does not
[11:36] <lotuspsychje> !sound | Dumle29

[12:54] <k-stz> rahulprodev: default, but maybe you want to read a bit into manual partitioning, so you know what your missing, it is rather simple too

[13:00] <SCHAAP137> anyone here run 14.10 with MATE? anyone notice that the icons in the notification tray don't automatically "center" themselves within the panel?
[13:01] <SCHAAP137> if i shrink the panel size to 31px and enlarge it again to 32px, then all icons in the notification tray are correctly center-snapped
[13:01] <codemagician> dasjoe: I think my hardware might need some things from 15 though.. as it uses the onboard intel graphics
[13:01] <sysop2> so is my answer "you cant?"
[13:02] <SCHAAP137> but at first, the icons in there appear "snapped-to-top"
[13:02] <SCHAAP137> was wondering if someone knows a workaround for this
[13:02] <rahulprodev> Hi, what will be the good size of /swap for 4 gb ram?
[13:02] <dasjoe> codemagician: try a live version of 14.xx, then :)
[13:03] <cfhowlett> rahulprodev, 1.5 to 2 times ram = 6 - 8

[13:03] <MonkeyDust> SCHAAP137  don't struggle with 14.10 too much or too long... next week 15.04 is released

[13:03] <codemagician> dasjoe: ah, I see run from the USBPEN direct to test
[13:03] <rahulprodev> cfhowlett, kostkon thanks.
[13:04] <dasjoe> codemagician: exactly. You can do a full installation to USB media, too.
[13:04] <SCHAAP137> cool MonkeyDust, eagerly awaiting it
[13:05] <SCHAAP137> hope Intel brings their 1.0.9 gfx driver release soon as well, for 15.04
[13:05] <MonkeyDust> SCHAAP137  guess you installed mate with a ppa? in 15.04, it's in the repos
[13:06] <rahulprodev> I'm installing ubuntu manual partitioning is this is good to go with /(root) - 20 gb, /swap - 6gb and /home - rest of the space?

[13:07] <SCHAAP137> have not added a ppa for it
[13:07] <cfhowlett> rahulprodev, pretty close to my set up - looks legit
[13:07] <rahulprodev> cfhowlett, cool, thanks :)
[13:09] <rahulprodev> if I want to make extra partition like for videos, can i make in future I mean after ubuntu is installed?
[13:09] <rebs> if i upgrdaee from 14.04 -> 15.05 will i expected to manual backup personal data and .rc files etc
[13:09] <cfhowlett> rebs, you should always do a manual backup before upgrding
[13:09] <rebs> yes
[13:09] <rebs> thats not quite my question

[13:15] <rahulprodev> hi, I'm installing ubuntu by manual partition, if I have to create partition after installion, is i need save free space this time?
[13:15] <rahulprodev> or is i can use /home space in future to create extra partition.
[13:16] <nrdb> rahulprodev, have you considered LVM?
[13:17] <BluesKaj> ra recommend you create a / and /home partition with gparted before installing the OS
[13:17] <rahulprodev> LVM? I don't know about it :(
[13:17] <BluesKaj> rahulprodev,^
[13:18] <rahulprodev> BluesKaj, hm, I created it by going ubuntu installing option "something else"
[13:18] <nrdb> rahulprodev, it allows you to create partitions as needed... but you could always create the partitions before installation but not use them until after the installation is done.
[13:19] <BluesKaj> rahulprodev, not sure, but that might work
[13:21] <rahulprodev> nrdb, hm then I will let 60 gb free space.

[13:59] <cfhowlett> *mode*

[14:08] <rahulprodev> nrdb, ok I'll try that.
[14:08] <sleepee> hey guys.  anybody know what's the worst that could happen if i reinstall and leave the /var partition unformatted?
[14:09] <nrdb> oopaine, you can bind two interfaces into one virtual one that is faster.
[14:09] <baxx> ok thanksssssssssssss
[14:09] <rahulprodev> baxx, i'm naive in linux scripting and command line :)
[14:10] <oopaine> i use virtualbox
[14:10] <sleepee> i'm reinstalling a machine i was using as a kvm host but i want to save the kvm guests that were in the /var partition...
[14:10] <rahulprodev> baxx, someone else can help u:)
[14:10] <rahulprodev> nrdb for /etc/skelton you mean skel directory?
[14:11] <nrdb> rahulprodev, yes thats it.  I didn't remember it correctly
[14:12] <baxx> rahulprodev: no worries! thanks for letting me know :)
[14:12] <sleepee> now that i think, i should probably ask in the ubuntu-server channel
[14:15] <nrdb> sleepee, I would suggest that you install as usual ... and after installation edit the /etc/fstab to mount the partition on top of the /var directory
[14:16] <sleepee> ahhh.. ok.  so just keep var in the / during the install and then separate it after the installation?
[14:18] <nrdb> sleepee, that way the '/var/' partition won't be touched during the install process.  and your VMs should be left alone... but as always a backup is always a good idea.
[14:18] <sleepee> ok.  thanks nrdb!  i'm going to give that a try!
[14:18] <sleepee> thanks for your help!

[14:22] <bodo_> hi. i want to install ubuntu unity. and i dont want only 1 partition i did create 2 beside swap. what type do i need to chose primary or logical?
[14:23] <nrdb> bodo_, it really doesn't matter, but you must use logical only if you need more than 4.
[14:24] <bodo_> oh ok. so if i have swap, / and /home i can use primary
[14:24] <nrdb> bodo_, yes.
[14:24] <bodo_> thank you

[14:41] <sysop2> still cant unlock using onboard.  I tried this but didnt help gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver embedded-keyboard-enabled false
[14:44] <oopaine> it's a virtualbox settings: 1 interface NAT and the second hostOnly ....  this machine is connected to the internat at the momend and packagesdownload works.
[14:45] <sysop2> I meant true on the end of that.
[14:46] <zerowaitstate> oopaine: it should just work. the host-only interface will get its routes via DHCP from virtualbox, and ditto for the NAT adapter
[14:47] <zerowaitstate> oopaine: that NAT adapter needs to be the default route (i.e., 0.0.0.0/0)
[14:47] <zerowaitstate> oopaine: the default route for the VM that is, not your actual computer
[14:47] <zerowaitstate> oopaine: but virtualbox usually handles this right
[14:48] <oopaine> i like to have a static ip adress for the hostOnly
[14:49] <zerowaitstate> oopaine: that's fine. just ensure that the 0.0.0.0 route always points to the NAT adapter and you're good
[14:49] <zerowaitstate> oopaine: the route to the host-only adapter will need to be a network that matches the IP assigned to the interface
[14:50] <zerowaitstate> oopaine: but generally, in a virtualbox environment, you are only talking about single-hop for hostonly connections, so there's no route propagation to worry about
[14:51] <oopaine> okay, thx ... i'll try. :)
[14:51] <zerowaitstate> oopaine: hence, the ip-address and subnet mask of the hostonly interface automatically creates a "direct-connect" route for that interface
[14:51] <wolfdog> ive been using cmus as my music player, which i LOVE. . while im working in console its great, but if I start X it wont play in the background while im working in that, comes back on only when i ctrl-alt-f2 back to my terminal. .. is there any way to get it persistently whever i am?
[14:52] <zerowaitstate> oopaine: what you're talking about is real easy man. I do it in vagrant all the time

[14:56] <wolfdog> SCHAAP137: just getting back into linux tbh, unfimilar with tmux ... by screen session do you mean within X?
[14:56] <sms> I have tried to use ubuntu iso 14.10, (No install, simply booted it) on hp stream 7
[14:57] <sms> unfortunately there are too many bugs, it got very slow and buggy to the point that i had to do a hard shutdown, it also did not detect wifi
[14:57] <SCHAAP137> no wolfdog, i mean a session inside /usr/bin/screen or /usr/bin/tmux
[14:57] <SCHAAP137> it's like, a console session that you can detach/attach to
[14:58] <SCHAAP137> so for instance, after boot, in non-X, you start tmux
[14:58] <sms> so what can i do about this? really want to use ubuntu, dont wanna be stuck with windows
[14:58] <rabaprodev> hello everyone :), if i wipe data by shred will it really become unrecoverable?
[14:58] <SCHAAP137> in there you start your stuff, then detach with Ctrl b, d
[14:58] <SCHAAP137> later inside X, you start a terminal application
[14:58] <SCHAAP137> and type: tmux attach
[14:58] <SCHAAP137> bam, back in the original tmux console session

[15:06] <goose> shinka: but \$ will escape the $
[15:07] <shinka> goose: Thanks!
[15:07] <goose> shinka: alternatively, if you quote it using single ticks (i.e. echo 'export PATH=${HOME}/Applications/sbt/bin/:${PATH}') then the string will be printed as-is

[15:28] <bazhang> admin3, its not there
[15:28] <TimeVirus> seems no one knows how to get a KDE program menu entry for Xfce ?

[15:31] <zerowaitstate> admin3: i.e., you can use "sudo apt-add-repository ppa:/webupd8team/sublime-text-2" to add their repository to your sources, then run "apt-get update" to update your cache, the run "apt-get install sublime-text" to install sublime 2
[15:31] <zerowaitstate> admin3: make sure to preface each command with "sudo"; I forgot to do that
[15:31] <TimeVirus> pretty sure it have reboot since the install but I'll relog see
[15:32] <admin3> tnx
[15:32] <bazhang> TimeVirus, there are plenty of gtk typing tutors
[15:32] <zerowaitstate> admin3: the nice thing about the PPA is you don't have to reinstall each time there is a new version; apt handles checking for new versions and does installation for you
[15:32] <TimeVirus> lol
[15:33] <TimeVirus> o\
[15:33] <SCHAAP137> there we go
[15:33] <zerowaitstate> admin3: bear in mind we do not typically support software from PPA's here
[15:33] <OerHeks> .. but if something goes wrong, we cannot help you with a PPA, then you must get help from owner
[15:33] <bazhang> typically as in never

[15:35] <zerowaitstate> i realize that's ot

[15:37] <yar_> want some hints on how to optimize the kernel?
[15:37] <TimeVirus> who?
[15:37] <TimeVirus> optimized how?
[15:38] <yar_> ???
[15:38] <yar_> by compiling it to my own needs?
[15:38] <OerHeks> yar_, that would be beyond the scope of this channel, i think.
[15:39] <infinitesum> Is there a way to use apt to install python3.3 on trusty/64? I only see a 3.4 package, so not sure if I can just install it manually or what?
[15:39] <yar_> OerHeks: i don't think so
[15:39] <OerHeks> infinitesum, downgrade is a bad idea
[15:39] <TimeVirus> so you are not really asking if someone wants hints on optimizing the kernel
[15:39] <bazhang> yar_, what is the exact issue
[15:39] <infinitesum> OerHeks: So if I want to use Python 3.3, should I just use an older version of Ubuntu?
[15:40] <bazhang> install build-essential yar_
[15:40] <bazhang> !compile | yar_ read this
[15:40] <xangua> yar_: yes you can compile your own kernel and see about a 1% plus in performance
[15:40] <ubottu> yar_ read this: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first). Also read !checkinstall
[15:40] <TimeVirus> why the question mark?
[15:40] <TimeVirus> lol
[15:40] <ioria> infinitesum, i remember something like pythonbrew... it creats a virtual enviroment... not sure  ...
[15:40] <infinitesum> My logic is the pypy says they are working on 3.3 compatibility, but 3.4 probably wont happen for a very long time
[15:40] <yar_> can't find exact word for that
[15:41] <TheNumb> infinitesum: you can download the sources and build it yourself.
[15:41] <bazhang> the word is gentoo yar_
[15:41] <TheNumb> bazhang: not really.
[15:41] <bazhang> read the links, install build-essential yar_
[15:41] <TheNumb> the python ebuild only has 2 slots
[15:41] <OerHeks> infinitesum, that would be 12.10, which is EOL, maybe this ppa is any help (  http://askubuntu.com/questions/244544/how-do-i-install-python-3-3 )  >>  https://launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/ubuntu/deadsnakes

[15:44] <TheNumb> Should be more helpful ;-)
[15:45] <OerHeks> infinitesum, if you are a beginner, question the program why it does not work with python 3.4
[15:45] <infinitesum> TheNumber: The issue isnt ansible, its that python3.4 on trusty is broken in a bunch of ways, but because Im running the commands using ansible its hard to figure out whats wrong
[15:46] <OerHeks> infinitesum, so how do you tell python 3.4 is broken?
[15:46] <infinitesum> if you google `ubuntu ensurepip`, there are several threads about how the trusty version of 3.4 is missing some key libraries needed to make virtualenvs work out of the box
[15:47] <TheNumb> infinitesum: I hope you're not trying to install ansible in a 3.4 virtualenv
[15:47] <infinitesum> haha no
[15:47] <TheNumb> Good ;p
[15:47] <infinitesum> just trying to use ansible to provision an ubuntu box, including creating a virtualenv and installing my requirements.txt
[15:47] <TheNumb> infinitesum: well, is there a bug report?
[15:48] <infinitesum> yeah there is, its unclear when it will be fixed... there is a workaround that works when just running the commands with the command line, but then reconciling that with ansible is proving to be kind of a pain
[15:49] <TheNumb> infinitesum: well, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/six/+bug/1433324

[17:50] <iampoz> hi everyone, I am new to making scripts and would like to make a fairly simple one. I am wondering if anyone could help or if it is off topic for here. shell or even awk would be fine.
[17:50] <yoosi> _X_C_V_B_: what are you trying to install?
[17:50] <_X_C_V_B_> yoosi: me and my shadow
[17:50] <EriC^^> iampoz: script to do what?
[17:50] <_X_C_V_B_> I got it working
[17:51] <sysop2> I need to run a perl script to make my touchscreen work,  where do I configure it to run right as lightdm does, it requires  x to be running so I cant put it in rc.local.
[17:52] <sysop2> that way I can use my touchscreen to login with.
[17:52] <iampoz> the goal of the script would be, for example: take the first text (csv file) of each line and then run a command that makes a file with that name
[17:53] <EriC^^> iampoz: first text of each line? can you give a sample of the line?
[17:53] <EriC^^> is the only thing on the line the filename?
[17:53] <iampoz> AAA,BBB,CCC ; first text of the line is AAA
[17:55] <SchrodingersScat> iampoz: echo "AAA,BBB,CCC" | cut -d , -f1
[17:56] <EriC^^> iampoz: for i in $(sed 's/,/\n/g' /path/to/file); do touch $i;done
[17:56] <EriC^^> SchrodingersScat: that will only take the first column of every line
[17:56] <MonkeyDust> iampoz  there's also #bash and #ubuntu-app-devel
[17:57] <konam> am i the only one experiencing EXTREME memery leak from firefox 37 ubuntu 14.04?
[17:57] <konam> memory*
[17:58] <iampoz> EriC^^, I will try that
[17:58] <TheNumb> konam: disable all the extensions and try again.
[17:58] <SchrodingersScat> EriC^^: thought that was the point, oh well.
[17:59] <ioria> iampoz i'll do a little c prog that fread each line and then calls system touch to create the file in a loop
[17:59] <EriC^^> iampoz: use for i in $(sed 's/,/\n/g' /path/to/file); do touch "$i"; done
[17:59] <EriC^^> in case it has spaces in the filename
[17:59] <konam> that kind of would beat the point of firefox wouldn't it? :)  TheNumb
[17:59] <konam> I'll just go back to 34
[18:00] <TheNumb> konam: one of the extensions might be buggy.
[18:00] <sysop2> konam, whenever I run chrome and firefox my swap starts filling up, I have to activate a swap file and then swapoff the partition and then swapon it and then swapoff the swapfile.
[18:01] <sysop2> that will clear out the swap for awhile till it starts building back again.
[18:01] <iampoz> SchrodingersScat, that was the point. you were right. Just not sure how to change "AAA,BBB,CCC" into the input file, I guess if I am in the directory, I just need to put the file name so I will try that.
[18:01] <konam> sysop2 i don't use swap partitions
[18:01] <sysop2> its been happening for years across many different versions.
[18:01] <sysop2> you dont use swap at all?
[18:02] <sysop2> or do you use a swap file?
[18:02] <EriC^^> iampoz: if you use SchrodingersScat command it will only take AAA from the first line, and ignore BBB and CCC
[18:02] <konam> i never have issues with memor + firefox, just started happening on this version sysop2
[18:02] <konam> sysop2 no, i don't use swap at all, i used to but saw that the benefits were minimal
[18:03] <iampoz> EriC^^, sorry that I was not more clear, that is what I want. I ran yours and it worked, but it also made files with names from BBB and CCC
[18:03] <sysop2> if you have enough ram your are right,  but I still use them, I guess out of tradition lol
[18:03] <konam> sysop2 if there were any benefits at all. i haven't missed it, everything has kept running smoothly
[18:03] <EriC^^> iampoz: oh ok
[18:03] <konam> sysop2 yes, i used to do it out of tradition too haha
[18:04] <SchrodingersScat> EriC^^ / iampoz: would sed 's/,.*//g' work?  would remove everything after the first comma, yeah?
[18:04] <Bashing-om> sysop2: One can do away with swap if one has enough ram installed to meet their needs, and do not ever intend to hebernate . I run with 4 Gigs and a very small swap partition - just in case .
[18:05] <EriC^^> iampoz: for i in $(cut -d, -f1 /path/to/file); do touch "$i"; done
=== z_ is now known as Guest85802
[18:06] <sysop2> yea I never hibernate either, I should stop using the swap part since I upgrade ram, but oh well. the tradition continues.
[18:06] <ikonia> there is nothing wrong with using a swap partition
[18:06] <iampoz> EriC^^, yes, that worked
[18:06] <ikonia> even if you have a lot of ram
[18:06] <ikonia> it can still be helpful
[18:07] <konam> ikonia yeah, there's nothing wrong with using one
[18:07] <Bashing-om> ikonia: sysop2 ^^ aggreed, is cheap insurance .
[18:07] <ikonia> not even insurance, it can help your system run, even with a lot of ram
[18:08] <konam> sysop2 when my pc doubled as media center i didn't hibernate much either. changed my setup and now i do it a lot
[18:09] <Bashing-om> ikonia: OK, I am in a learning mode .. as I understand it, swap is not even touched till there are ram usage contraints ?
[18:09] <ikonia> Bashing-om: no, thats not true

[18:09] <BZWingZero> I have a samba share set up on my linux server, being accessed from my windows desktop. Files created on the share in windows are given the wrong permissions: 770. I need help getting newly created files to have 774 permissions.
[18:09] <ikonia> swap is not just used as an overflow buffer
[18:10] <BZWingZero> I have already configured my samba.conf, but it seems to be ignored
[18:10] <daftykins> BZWingZero: use the samba share declaration to force default perms
[18:10] <BZWingZero> daftykins, they're being ignored
[18:10] <daftykins> your values must be wrong
[18:10] <Bashing-om> ikonia: Noted ! Thanks for the instruction .
[18:10] <daftykins> double check them with testparm
[18:10] <daftykins> BZWingZero: bear in mind in the conf, i think they need to be written as 0774
[18:10] <ikonia> Bashing-om: there is more to it than that, but thats just a high level summary
[18:11] <BZWingZero> daftykins, http://pastebin.com/vbzLved3 current relevant config from testparm
[18:12] <daftykins> lol path removed
[18:12] <Bashing-om> ikonia: Good place to start the thought process, though . I have yet to ever know enough .
[18:12] <daftykins> oh noes i don't know your local share
[18:13] <BZWingZero> considering this will end up being a web-root...
[18:13] <daftykins> oh no you're not one of those web devs that copies and pastes are you?
[18:13] <BZWingZero> (either way, path is irrelevant for the problem, its functioning properly)
[18:13] <daftykins> BZWingZero: so the Windows client is being used via guest?
[18:13] <BZWingZero> correct
[18:14] <daftykins> to which query?
[18:14] <sysop2> I need to run a perl script to make my touchscreen work,  where do I configure it to run right as lightdm starts, it requires  x to be running so I cant put it in rc.local.
[18:14] <BZWingZero> windows has mapped the share via guest.
[18:14] <daftykins> valid users and guest seems a contradiction to me
[18:14] <BZWingZero> I think
[18:15] <BZWingZero> smbstatus shows the correct username
[18:15] <BZWingZero> but turning off guest access prevents from connecting.
[18:16] <daftykins> only as that's how you've authed with the samba host most likely
[18:16] <daftykins> you would have to disconnect the share, remove it from the Windows user accounts' cache then retry
[18:17] <daftykins> what ubuntu is running on the host end?
[18:17] <BZWingZero> lts 14.04.2

[18:18] <daftykins> ok let me just check out the configs on the hosts i deal with
[18:18] <BZWingZero> take your time. I appreciate the help. Spent 6 hours fruitlessly googling yesteday on this problem.
[18:19] <daftykins> BZWingZero: first off, keep a copy of your current /etc/samba/smb.conf then and we'll mess with it :D
[18:19] <BZWingZero> Something else that makes me go "huh". If I change my create mask and force create mode to 0777, newly created files get all permissions EXCEPT global read.
[18:19] <BZWingZero> which is what I need
[18:20] <EriC^^> BZWingZero: oh hey :)
[18:20] <daftykins> so i take it the use case here is web dev work?
[18:20] <EriC^^> BZWingZero: daftykins will get you all set i'm sure ;)
[18:20] <BZWingZero> daftykins, for now. I built a linux server to learn. Web is my day job, figured I might as well start with learning how to config a webserver
[18:20] <BZWingZero> EriC^^, ty for your help yesterday :)
[18:20] <EriC^^> np :)
[18:21] <daftykins> ooh am i making 3 a crowd? was there some input on this one yesterday?
[18:21] <BZWingZero> daftykins, we ran into a brick wall a few times. Not much success.
[18:21] <EriC^^> daftykins: no, i was trying to help him, i don't know anything about samba though
[18:22] <daftykins> BZWingZero: so as default the apache2 doc root is /var/www/html, what've you done to handle file ownership in there?
[18:22] <daftykins> i tend to create a web site management group, then add my user and www-data to it
[18:22] <BZWingZero> I'm using nginx. I have a user account with full access to the folder.
[18:22] <daftykins> right but you can't really have your user own the path and nginx run as a different user
[18:23] <daftykins> so i do the above then have the doc root owned by www-data:mygroup
[18:24] <daftykins> BZWingZero: just as an example this is the config i have for someone - http://paste.ubuntu.com/10852300/
[18:25] <daftykins> i make use of the Windows user accounts on the clients to auth directly with the samba host, i create the users then set their smb passwords with smbpasswd
[18:25] <BZWingZero> I suspect its a user account issue, and not actually a samba.conf issue. And I know next to nothing about linux user accounts
[18:27] <daftykins> righty-o, well first step you'll want to disconnect the mapped drive on your Windows host, then run "control userpasswords2" and check the advanced tab -> manage passwords for any stored passes for that host. Probably nothing there though since guest is in use
[18:27] <BZWingZero> The windows network drive mapping is dead
[18:29] <_jay> issues on upgrade 12.04-14.04- currently I have no desktop icons. They start to load, but is seems like it crashes when generating jgeg or pdf previews? Folder icons are there already at first login.
=== dm7freek is now known as macfreek
[18:31] <daftykins> BZWingZero: as in removed?
[18:32] <BZWingZero> yes. The windows computer has no trace of the mapped share.
[18:33] <wafflejock> BZWingZero, regular linux user accounts aren't really very complicated, /etc/passwd has all the users and their login shell, /etc/group has the group listings, you can use the "groups" command to see groups for the logged in user or "groups username" to see groups for a particular user... so a user can be in many groups, each path (file/directory) has two parts to the ownership the user and the group, then it has the permissions
[18:33] <wafflejock>  which control read/write/execute for the paths user, group, and anyone else (other)
[18:33] <BZWingZero> wafflejock, so a lot less granualr than windows accounts.
[18:33] <wafflejock> BZWingZero, unless you install some access control list (ACL) stuff it's really a little less sophisticated than windows permissions
[18:34] <wafflejock> but I'm not really privvy to the samba problems, I do use VirtualBox for running dev environments but I just use the virtual box shared folder settings and it's linux in linux
[18:34] <daftykins> BZWingZero: so right now does your Linux user match your Windows username?
[18:35] <BZWingZero> daftykins, at the moment yes. I can create a new account on either if needed.
[18:35] <daftykins> nah that's ideal
