[04:07] <Chipzzz> I have an ATI r2400 video card that works fine for days at a time. Suddenly it will catch a fit and I'll see [drm:r600_audio_bits_per_sample] in the kernel log. After that, the x server goes bonkers. Any suggestions?
[04:07] <trench> truepurple: now i have installed two computers with ubuntu while you have been talking here :P
[04:07] <gratnam11> maybe my network cards sucks?
[04:07] <Starminn> gratnam11: It could be a hardware incompatibility issue, then. Regarding discerning what that might be I can't help with as I'm not very knowledgable in that field; however from my personal experience Linux runs faster. If your computer is very new, though, also keep in mind that the developers may not have had a chance to write up the compatability for your hardware.
[04:07] <gratnam11> i grapped it out of my oldbox
[04:07] <truepurple> sacarlson: what is this usb flash installer you were talking about earlier that can have multiple boots in it?
[04:07] <sacarlson> truepurple: uRock: yes unetbootin  is free and runs on windows just download it and the ubuntu iso and install the unet.. and run it
[04:07] <gratnam11> because it works great with windows
[04:07] <truepurple> trench meaningless
[04:08] <trench> truepurple: but true :P
[04:08] <sacarlson> truepurple: that version isn't avalable on windows sorry
[04:08] <truepurple> Name anyway please
[04:08] <Starminn> gratnam11: You could always try running an Internet search of "Linux compatible <your network card>"
[04:08]  * uRock knows how to install via every mode except using a PXE server
[04:09] <gratnam11> okey thanks
[04:09] <demonspork> what is that cloud based OS
[04:09] <Starminn> gratnam11: Actually "Linux problem <your network card>" might be better.
[04:09] <demonspork> I think it is based on Ubuntu
[04:09] <brophat> i am going to install ubuntu and am going to use encryption do i or should I do a special install that would be beneficial for encryption maybe such as a special partition setup?
[04:09] <Starminn> demonspork: Run a search on ChromeOS to see an example.

[04:30] <weecol> how are you doinbg
[04:30] <tycable> rww, thanks
[04:30] <bazhang> truepurple, then you want some other os installer on there? you can make it persistent (save changes on it) usb stick= pendrive but otherwise yes the rest of the stick is unusable. Please do some basic reading on this.

[04:32] <weecol> mind a pm session
[04:32] <mayo> no thats fine
[04:32] <sacarlson> truepurple: and yes with the unet.. standard installed it would be normal for the rest of the space to be unnaccessble, it does a dd install that only sets up the needed partition for the boot
[04:32] <syphirx> I have a question, I've been having a minor (but extremely annoying) problem. What is causing Pithos (and  other things) to lag?

[04:34] <alejandro> cabbrick1243, i installed it through synaptic, how can i update that way?
[04:35] <syphirx> This is really annoying me, it seems that everything is fine, but the sound lags (lets say on 1:39) then lags for a second, no sound, then continues at 1:42 or whatever
[04:36] <Starminn> doodleknox: I hate to say it, but if you haven't done anything on it yet you may consider just reinstalling.. :/
[04:37] <syphirx> This problem isn't just just with Pithos, but with other things like Banshee and Rythembox
[04:37] <cabbrick1243> alejandro: those are rarely updated, but in the case that they are then type
[04:37] <cabbrick1243> "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" which is a whole update... The only way I know of to get the latest is to build from source. What are you trying to run with wine anyway?

[04:46] <weecol> mayo u using network manager
[04:47] <Chipzzz> mayo: you have to edit the file and add your card
[04:47] <truepurple> Dang it, chat stopped updating without any notification
[04:47] <mayo> yes
[04:47] <mayo> how?
[04:48] <mayo> chipzzz how exactly please?
[04:48] <kitty_> ok, i'm really confused and i don't know how i broke my firestarter firewall but now it no longer forwards any traffic from my router to the internet, anyone able to help me?

[04:48] <Mean_Admin> kitty_: describe
[04:48] <robertzaccour> mayo, i sent you a link, did you try that?
[04:48] <kitty_> it will give me an error message in dmesg... looking for one
[04:49] <Chipzzz> mayo: add these two lines: 1) auto wlan0 and 2) iface wlan0 inet dhcp (don't add the '1)' and '2)', of course) then reboot... you should have wireless
[04:49] <sacarlson> truepurple: and yes with the unet.. standard installed it would be normal for the rest of the space to be unnaccessble, it does a dd install that only sets up the needed partition for the boot

[04:49] <mayo> may you send it again pleas
[04:49] <peeps[lappy]> does anyone here use an IRC bouncer?  i've never tried one, looking for suggestions
[04:49] <Gnea> kitty_: is forwarding turned on in /proc?
[04:49] <weecol> the line would probably go some thing like iface wlan0 inet dhcp and then include thye net work information for using ifconfig pkg are you wanting to use network manager
[04:49] <robertzaccour> mayo, it was the first link when i searched ralink 3090
[04:49] <mayo> chipzzz where do i add?
[04:50] <kitty_> how would one check?
[04:50] <Bushy> I have a noob question, I'm very new to unbuntu.  I want to change the inactivity time out that causes a login to screen.  Any suggestions where to look?
[04:50] <Gnea> by reading the appropriate file
[04:50] <Chipzzz> mayo: type sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces
[04:50] <weecol> interfaces for the ifupdown pkg route3

[04:50] <Mean_Admin> Gnea: ah the damned echo 1 > /proc/something something
[04:50] <Gnea> kitty_: should be /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
[04:50] <truepurple> sacarlson But if I do this persistance thing, I could have live CD, and still use the rest of the space on the partition?

[04:50] <ubottu> Mean_Admin: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional.
[04:51] <kitty_> yes it is turned on
[04:52] <mayo> it says gedit is not installed
[04:52] <Chipzzz> robertzaccour: he already installed the driver
[04:52] <sacarlson> truepurple: I tried that before but at the time it wasn't supported yet,  I think it's a plan to make it work so they had the gui setup to suport it, it may work by now, I'm not sure
[04:52] <Starminn> Bushy: Try this if you would please: System->Preferences->Screensaver -> Uncheck "Lock when screen is idle" (or something to that effect) I don't know if it will work, but it's worth a shot certainly. ;)
[04:52] <Chipzzz> mayo: type sudo apt-get install gedit
[04:52] <Gnea> kitty_: do all websites simply not work? did an ip change?
[04:52] <Bushy> I will thanks
[04:53] <truepurple> sacarlson so persistance isn't supported yet?
[04:53] <kitty_> i have a script that i run to reset the firewall anytime i disconnect/reconnect to a network/any network
[04:54] <Gnea> kitty_: okay, does it work if you reboot?
[04:54] <kitty_> its never needed me to reboot before
[04:54] <truepurple> sacarlson: You mean persistance isn't supported yet?
[04:54] <v_> i need offline dictionary can anyone tell me ?
[04:54] <v_> kitty:i need offline dictionary can anyone tell me ?
[04:55] <Gnea> kitty_: it sounds silly, but try it and see what happens

[04:55] <kitty_> i have masq shell scripts for each of my possible internet iface devices, the script i can run manually will check if any of them are up and re-issue the firewall with specific information on which interface to use and will re-issue routing table entries

[04:56] <Starminn> v_: One comes by default in 10.10 I believe?
[04:56] <Starminn> Gnea: My apologies.
[04:57] <Gnea> kitty_: is it a homemade script or something that came with the firewall software?
[04:57] <truepurple> sacarlson: You mean persistance isn't supported yet?
[04:57] <weecol> where would the appropreate place be to get the driver module loaded in to the kernel for a wireless (mayo)
[04:57] <v_> Starminn: that is online
[04:57] <Starminn> v_: Oh, I gotcha. I'll see what I can find

[04:58] <mayo> chipzzz i added those line
[04:58] <kitty_> i used the output from the firewall software to just make new scripts that will point to different interfaces and will grab my internet address from the main script when it spits it out in a file in /root
[04:58] <mayo> now what chipzzz
[04:58] <Gnea> !11.04 | Lomion
[04:58] <ubottu> Lomion: Natty Narwhal is the codename for Ubuntu 11.04, due April 28 2011 - Help and support (only) in #ubuntu+1 - Natty is unstable and is not intended for production systems.
[04:59] <Bushy> Starminn thanks for the suggestion, it worked.
[04:59] <doodlenox> whats the quickest way to reinstall - first isntall had errors
[04:59] <doodlenox> i dont need to save anything
[04:59] <Starminn> Bushy: Awesome. Happy Ubuntu-ing.
[04:59] <truepurple> sacarlson: Ok I tried to install ubuntu live CD onto a USB flash drive, I failed, but now I can't access it, I just need to reformat it? Could I point unetbootin to it again without needing to reformat?
[04:59] <Jackalope> im runnning kubuntu 10.10 and looks like things dont pop up of overlapping when im scrolling down in a web browser
[04:59] <Gnea> kitty_: well, I've never used that software before, perhaps you could pastebin it?
[04:59] <mayo> chipzzz?
[05:00] <fabian> hi
[05:00] <nightangel> im running a dell ispiron 1750 and im tring to get the Broadcom sta wireless driver to load and dont know how to do it
[05:00] <v_> Starminn: thanks budy
[05:00] <fabian> im form Peru
[05:00] <fabian> i'm from Peru
[05:00] <Chipzzz> mayo: type cat /etc/network/interfaces and post it on pastebin again... if anything is wrong with that file, you won't have wired access either, but if the syntax is good, you'll have both
[05:00] <AbhijiT> !br | fabian

[05:00] <Starminn> v_: Not a problem. In fact, thank you. I'm gonna grab myself a copy too. :)
[05:01] <sacarlson> truepurple: yes it should reformat it for you but you might want to do an md5sum on the iso to be sure it's correct before you attempt doing it again
[05:01] <v_> Starminn: good too
[05:01] <fabian> i'm gonna speak in english
[05:01] <Chipzzz> mayo: if the file is good, you'll have to reboot to get the new interface
[05:01] <AbhijiT> fabian, ask your ubuntu question
[05:01] <fabian> i'km gonna make a trivial game about FOSS
[05:02] <fabian> *i'm
[05:02] <Starminn> v_: Glad to hear. :)
[05:02] <truepurple> sacarlson I don't have a ISO, I have about 170kb of unknown data
[05:02] <fabian> question about programming, technology
[05:02] <kylemm>  whats the best game/program to get?
[05:02] <fabian> for example
[05:02] <sacarlson> truepurple: you might want to download an iso file first then and check it
[05:03] <mayo> chipzzz http://pastebin.com/gbHQCDAY
[05:03] <fabian> can sb make a question with the answer?
[05:03] <fabian> please
[05:03] <fabian> ??
[05:03] <icedtea> the best program is /bin/yes
[05:03] <robert___> hi
[05:03] <philneo> /bin/yes?
[05:03] <truepurple> sacarlson what about the existing microscopic data, just install over it?
[05:03] <rww> I prefer /bin/true.
[05:03] <Starminn> kylemm: Depends on what you're looking for.
[05:03] <rww> philneo: yes
[05:03] <icedtea> oops /usr/bin/yes
[05:03] <kylemm> a cool fun program to fool around with for a bit
[05:03] <philneo> what it does?
[05:04] <rww> philneo: yes
[05:04] <sacarlson> truepurple: ya just download anther iso image http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download
[05:04] <mayo> chipzzz?
[05:04] <nightangel> can some one help me with getting my broadcom wireless driver to load
[05:04] <rww> philneo: when you inevitably try running it, you may find the keyboard shortcut ctrl-c useful.
[05:04] <truepurple> sacarlson, I didn't download the image, I direct downloaded it through unetbootin
[05:05] <truepurple> sacarlson and I think it failed when I ran out of HDD space, but I am not sure
[05:05] <mayo> hello?
[05:05] <sacarlson> truepurple: well like you said that didn't work,  so try another method
[05:05] <fabian> hello
[05:05] <kylemm> Starminn: a cool fun program to fool around with for bit
[05:05] <Chipzzz> mayo: when you were editing the file, did you delete anything?
[05:05] <mayo> no
[05:05] <truepurple> sacarlson No need to reformat the existing drive though right?
[05:05] <sacarlson> truepurple: oh yes that would be a problem,  you do need at least 600meg disk space to do this
[05:05] <Starminn> kylemm: Well, my idea of "fun" and yours inevitably vary greatly. :)
[05:05] <kylemm> like a cool program lol :D
[05:06] <sacarlson> truepurple: no need to reformat,  but you will have to clean up you hd to have the space needed
[05:06] <mayo> no it is still there
[05:06] <philneo> rww:lolz
[05:06] <Starminn> kylemm: If you're looking for a game I am partial to SuperTuxKart. :) My suggestion, though, is to open up the Software Center and just look around, downloading whatever tickles your fancy.
[05:06] <philneo> yyy
[05:06] <weecol> chipzzz do you know how to register a driver to be loaded in ubuntu
[05:06] <mayo> no
[05:06] <Chipzzz> mayo: if you type  sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces, does the file look like what is posted in the link you just sent?
[05:07] <fabian> can somebody make me question about FOSS?
[05:07] <mayo> yes chipzzz
[05:07] <mayo> no chipzzz
[05:07] <bazhang> fabian, not really on topic here; try #ubuntu-trivia
[05:07] <truepurple> sacarlson I have 685mb on my main drive, and 844mb on a extra drive, apparenly 685mb wasn't enough
[05:07] <mayo> it says the things you told me to put
[05:07] <Starminn> fabian: Would this belong in the off-topic channel? #ubuntu-offtopic
[05:07] <fabian> ok
[05:07] <Aerosonic> Hi guys. I am helping out the IT department at a local high school. I was wondering if i could bring any use of Ubuntu to that school. The computers suck, they run an outdated Windows XP. Basically they want to restrict the computers and be able to view each and every kid's desktop while they are logged in. The school has about 900 computers.
[05:07] <fabian> thanks
[05:07] <mayo> in addition to whta was there already
[05:07] <Starminn> Or what bazhang said, fabian.

[05:08] <peeps[lappy]> is there a ppa for gimp 2.8
[05:08] <Chipzzz> weecol: he installed the driver from the deb package
[05:09] <weecol> or in kubuntu there are others
[05:09] <Aerosonic> Dr_Willis: I know, Ubuntu is the most flexible OS I've used so far.
[05:09] <weecol> loading it in the the kernel
[05:09] <WACOMalt> Anyone in here fammiliar with X11 forwarding? I am wondering if this could be a replacement for my VNC. I got it set up but it seems to be a per application solution.
[05:09] <kylemm> thanks
[05:09] <Aerosonic> I was wondering if there was some special edition for schools
[05:09] <Starminn> kylemm: I second Pidgin. I'm using it right now for this IRC chat.
[05:09] <bazhang> Aerosonic, edubuntu
[05:09] <sacarlson> truepurple: well point the iso download to put the file in the 844mb left disk that might be enuf

[05:10] <mayo> chipzzz weecol, thank you
[05:10] <czardoz> Aerosonic, there is edubuntu
[05:10] <storytellerxD> nope i just cant make my sound work i mean it works but trashed like not quality sound
[05:10] <Aerosonic> bazhang: Ty, hahah.. but does it have all of it already installed or do you need to spend an hour tweaking each computer?
[05:10] <Aerosonic> Starminn: Already downloading, thanks
[05:10] <bazhang> Aerosonic, you want some thin client solution it sounds like
[05:10] <Chipzzz> mayo: does it work?
[05:10] <Dr_Willis> Aerosonic:  theres that edubuntu varianbt.
=== fred_ is now known as Guest5942
[05:11] <Starminn> Aersonic: It has a lot already installed. It's not the typical few hundred MB CD, it is a bit over a GB.
[05:11] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  x11 forwarding is per 'app' yes. thats how it works.
[05:11] <sacarlson> truepurple: but it might need almost 2X the 600meg to uncompress parts to install onto the usb flash, so better setup more free space
[05:11] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  vnc does a complete x 'session' thats how vnc works. :)
[05:11] <WACOMalt> Dr_Willis:  so no way to show my whole desktop via x11 forwarding?
[05:11] <_karlo_> test
[05:11] <Aerosonic> Dr_Willis: 2.40GB
[05:11] <mayo> no
[05:11] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  theres also 'freenx' thats similer to vnc. but faster.
[05:11] <truepurple> sacarlson So how do you download netinstall?
[05:11] <mayo> chipzzz it doesn't
[05:11] <weecol> i suggested loadeing the driver
[05:11] <Aerosonic> The edubuntu is 2.40GB
[05:11] <Chipzzz> mayo: hhave you rebooted?
[05:12] <mayo> no, not yet
[05:12] <Aerosonic> Okay thanks guys
[05:12] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  run the gnome-panel and stuff it launches should show up on the  local desktop. but its still a'per app' type session
[05:12] <Aerosonic> bbs
[05:12] <WACOMalt> Dr_Willis: would be able to help me get that set up? I have it already installed, but on my windows side the client I have seems to hate me
[05:12] <sacarlson> truepurple: I thought you already had unetboot installed?
[05:12] <truepurple> Sacarlson How sure are you of that 2x? I was told by someone else that it would require almost no virtual memory
[05:12] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  set what up exactly? I just use xming+putty as needed to get my linux apps appering on my windows box.
[05:12] <Chipzzz> mayo: if the interfaces file is ok, it should work when you reboot
[05:12] <weecol> he's gone
[05:13] <linuxguy101> I am testing out a opera file server for linux tonight tell me what you think. http://admin.home.zogozan.operaunite.com
[05:13] <sacarlson> truepurple: not sure at all, I've never had so little space
[05:13] <WACOMalt> Dr_Willis: Well I tried "NX Client for windows" and when connected it just has a blank screen
[05:13] <truepurple> sacarlson I do, but it might be better to directly download netinstall and use unetbootin to put it on the USB flash drive. Or isn't that possible?
[05:13] <WACOMalt> Also do you know the xfce panel app name?
[05:13] <weecol> chipzzz: pm?
[05:14] <sacarlson> truepurple: it will still have to put the iso on your hard disk before it starts to install it to the usb flash so you will still need the space
[05:14] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  i found 'nx' to be confuseing to setup. theres several 'variants' of it (free/nonfree/gpl) -  i had it working.. then it stopped.. so went back to just plain xming or vnc.
[05:14] <weecol> talk about getting on the irc list
[05:14] <WACOMalt> gotcha.
[05:14] <WACOMalt> X11 forwarding is giving me errors with the xfce panels
[05:14] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  try 'xf<tab>'  i think its xfpanel. i dont care much for xfce
[05:14] <WACOMalt> tried running "PuTTY X11 proxy: wrong authentication protocol attemptedxfce4-panel: Cannot open display:"
[05:14] <truepurple> Sacarlson I thought netinstall downloaded the ISO from the internet after boot?
[05:14] <weecol> and other registers
[05:15] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  other apps work?
[05:15] <nightangel> im having trouble getting my wireless network hardware to load its drivers it got it to work when i was using the live CD but now that i have it loaded it dosent seem to want to find the drivers. can some one help
[05:15] <WACOMalt> Dr_Willis: neither did I, but apparantly in some very random cases Gnome with tightvnc messes up your keymappings O_o
[05:15] <WACOMalt> I got xterm to work yes
[05:15] <WACOMalt> x
[05:15] <WACOMalt> I wish "startx" would work :P
[05:16] <truepurple> Sacarlson well not the ISO, I mean ubuntu install, am I wrong?
[05:16] <sacarlson> truepurple: first it has to download the iso file to your hard drive then uncompress parts of it and then moves the files to the usb flash
[05:16] <WACOMalt> Now I keep getting:  Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: localhost:10.0 whenever I start any app
[05:16] <truepurple> sacarlson after reboot, onto the machine you want to install it on, right?
[05:16] <weecol> wacomalt: do you like the dm packages?
[05:17] <storytellerxD> guys any idea if there is any way to update audio drivers?
[05:17] <sacarlson> truepurple: just the iso file  is 600meg and uncompresed it's over 1 gig
[05:17] <WACOMalt> dm packages?
[05:17] <weecol> display managers
[05:17] <WACOMalt> which ones?
[05:17] <mayo> i still cant click the tab to select wireless
[05:17] <truepurple> sacarlson after reboot, onto the machine you want to install it on, right?
[05:17] <weecol> gdm and kdm
[05:17] <WACOMalt> I like XFCE and gnome so far
[05:17] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  these days i just use xming on windows normally, and its wizard/ tool to start specific apps.
[05:17] <WACOMalt> oohh
[05:17] <mayo> it is greyed out chipzzz
[05:17] <WACOMalt> weecol: I dont use them honestly this is a headless server
[05:18] <fred__> how do you specify a port when connecting to an using this program
[05:18] <Chipzzz> mayo: type ifconfig
[05:18] <weecol> can apply to over the network
[05:18] <truepurple> sacarlson after reboot, onto the machine you want to install it on, right?
[05:18] <weecol> network terminals
[05:18] <WACOMalt> Dr_Willis: know what error I may be having?  Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: localhost:10.0
[05:18] <sacarlson> truepurple: oh maybe you have the space to install the mini iso but you would have to download the iso manualy and use unetboot to install that
[05:18] <WACOMalt> now I get that even with xterm, which had launched correctly
[05:19] <weecol> what's the security on thouse terminal progs
[05:19] <gryfft> I'm trying to install an intel 82852 graphics driver. I'm in over my head. Can anyone point me in the right direction? :x
[05:19] <truepurple> sacarlson after reboot, onto the machine you want to install it on, right?
[05:19] <WACOMalt> startx... what is the command to stop it?
[05:19] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:   when you use ssh and the X forwarging the DISPLAy variable is set to that localhost:10, you are doing this via vnc? or xming? or what once you ssh in?
[05:19] <mayo> http://pastebin.com/2LTB12p1
[05:19] <weecol> you close the window manager
[05:19] <sacarlson> truepurple: the unetboot defaults will just download the full desktop version
[05:19] <mayo> chipzzz http://pastebin.com/2LTB12p1
[05:19] <WACOMalt> doing this via ssh
[05:19] <weecol> logout
[05:20] <WACOMalt> and xming
[05:20] <gryfft> This is in the all-important cause of Minecraft, I"ll just point out.
[05:20] <WACOMalt> indeed
[05:20] <WACOMalt> Howd did you know? :P
[05:20] <truepurple> Sacarlson I didn't understand that. With netinstall, you don't need to download the ISO, it does that actively after reboot on the machine you want to install it on, right?
[05:20] <gizmobay> I messed up my groups file. What group do I need to add myslef to so I can use sudo? adm, root
[05:20] <gryfft> I meant for my problem, but Minecraft is universally important, I feel we can all agree.
[05:20] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  you NEED a X server on the local box. for the apps to appear on.. thats xmings job...

[05:21] <WACOMalt> Dr_Willis: which I have up and running
[05:21] <bazhang> gryfft, but offtopic here ; how does this relate to ubuntu?
[05:21] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  if you are just sshing in,, and running a X app.. windows cant display it.
[05:21] <weecol> admin group
[05:21] <WACOMalt> oh
[05:21] <WACOMalt> worked for xterm... O_o
[05:21] <jmbrowning> what does universe mean when referring to a package?
[05:21] <gizmobay> thanks
[05:21] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  then you ahve somthing set up wrong.  I jhad to twiddle with the ssh settings in putty to get it workign that way i recall
[05:21] <gryfft> bazhang: I'm trying to install the proprietary Intel drivers, 'cause apparently what I have is crashing it.
[05:21] <truepurple> sacarlson I thought the whole point of netinstall was to download ubuntu after you boot, not before, am I wrong?
[05:21] <bazhang> jmbrowning, the repo
[05:21] <sacarlson> truepurple: as I said already it installs the entire iso file onto the usb flash,  then you boot the flash that will have the needed files to install to your hd
[05:21] <WACOMalt> I haev X11 forwarding torned on and pointed to my localhost xserver from putty
[05:21] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  or just use the xming 'wizard' thing. and be carefull you dont accidnetly run 2 xming X servers.
[05:22] <WACOMalt> cant find it
[05:22] <weecol> look up sudo config
[05:22] <EmuAlert> How do I delete the .Trash-1000 file on my removable drives? How do I turn off this feature and just have everything go into this computer's trash?
[05:22] <jmbrowning> bazhang: arduino is in the universe repository, but hasnt' been updated. how do i contact the package manager, if there is one
[05:22] <Chipzzz> mayo: type lspci
[05:22] <sacarlson> truepurple: yes it installs the installer onto the usb flash,  for that you need the space
[05:22] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  i tended t just make a xming wizard/mauncher that ran gnome-terminal, then ran all apps from that. Dident even use putty after i set that up.
[05:22] <EmuAlert> uh, it's a folder, actually
[05:22] <weecol> chipzzz wasn't it a usb
[05:22] <WACOMalt> ah
[05:23] <truepurple> sacarlson  Space on the USB flash drive?
[05:23] <gryfft> The last step of the most promising tutorial I went through is sudo apt-add-repository ppa:glasen/855gm-fix. And it doesn't appear to be working.
[05:23] <Chipzzz> weecol: not as far as I know
[05:23] <kylemm> any1 successfully get visual effects to work on a LIVE CD with Nvidia drive?
[05:23] <weecol> thanks
[05:23] <sacarlson> truepurple: yes BOTH  you need about 1gig on you hard disk just to install the installer on the usb flash
[05:23] <truepurple> sacrlson This is for a new computer that has over 2tb of space, hard drive space will not be a issue after reboot
[05:23] <WACOMalt> localhost:O.O ... is that where my putty should be pointing?  The tutorial says O not 0 ...which confuses me

[05:24] <mayo> hello?
[05:24] <weecol> hey
[05:24] <fred__> ubuntu 11.04 livecd always crash with the nvidia drivers i had to take the effects
[05:24] <AbhijiT> mayo, hhi
[05:24] <weecol> your new in the conversation
=== LjL-Temp is now known as Guest16160
[05:24] <bazhang> fred__, #ubuntu+1 for that
[05:24] <sacarlson> truepurple: well it seems to be an issue for the computer you are using to install the installer
[05:24] <kylemm> fred_: did u get it to work?
[05:24] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  with the drivers frim system -> admin-> addational drivers..  issue is it wants to reboot after installing the drivers.. then you lose the drivers. :) Ive  done a live cd -> flash drive. and gotten them workign with a few tweaks..
[05:25] <truepurple> sacarlson what is a issue?
[05:25] <WACOMalt> wacomalt
[05:25] <kylemm> dr_Willis: can you help me? as im running this on a Live USB aswell
[05:25] <fred__> no, the thing basically halts at boot
[05:25] <fred__> what does ubuntu+1 means
[05:25] <fred__> or do
[05:25] <bazhang> fred__, this is not the natty support chan   #ubuntu+1 is
[05:25] <WACOMalt> versions that are newer than the release
[05:26] <fred__> oh
[05:26] <fred__> my bad
[05:26] <truepurple> sacarlson what is a issue? What are you talking about?
[05:26] <bazhang> truepurple, your tiny hdd
[05:26] <sacarlson> truepurple: not enuf hard disk space on the computer that you are using to install the installer to the usb flash disk,  1 gig hd must be needed for the standard desktop installer
[05:26] <Chipzzz> mayo: it's a pci card, not a usb device, right?
[05:26] <v_> Does anyone knows for  software for seeing partitions of Hard Disk ?
[05:27] <pickett> hi, when i copy over the network I only get 600k/s with wireless n, if I change the connection to wireless g i get 2.4mb/s, anyone know why this would be?
[05:27] <bazhang> v_gparted
[05:27] <mayo> yes a pci device
[05:27] <pickett> also when i copy from a windows comp over the network with wireless n i get 4.5-5.5mb/s
[05:27] <sacarlson> truepurple: if I'm wrong then just download the http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download  file and install it
[05:27] <truepurple> sacarlson Yes, that is why I wish to use the netinstaller, can I download it to my hard drive then use netbootin to put it on the USB flash drive? If so, where do I go to download netinstall?
[05:27] <weecol> ok my bad on that one
[05:27] <Chipzzz> mayo: type lspci
[05:27] <WACOMalt> X11 forwarding error: xfce4-terminal:1456): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: localhost:10.0           Dr_Willis how do you launch this XMing wizard? I dont see it as having been installed
[05:28] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  if i recall correctly, i installed the nvidia drivers,  I did not do a 'sudo apt-get update, or sudo apt-get upgrade' (that can goof things up), then  generated a proper xorg.conf with the nvidia-settings command after i rebooted..  and got it working. THEN i had to keep that xorg.conf somewhere and restore it as the system bootede the next time (copied the xorg.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf)
[05:28] <Dr_Willis> because it kept getting reset on each new reboot.
[05:28] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  the xming package has some wizard/lauincher tool/icon in the menus.
[05:28] <sacarlson> truepurple: maybe I don't know what the netinstaller is and how will it save you the space needed?
[05:28] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  i did this during beta of 10.04 - so its been a while since i last used it.
[05:29] <truepurple> sacarlson You've been telling me about it, how can you say you don't know what it is now? geesh
[05:29] <sacarlson> truepurple: I assume you are talking about unetbootin
[05:29] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/   'This essential installer includes the XLaunch wizard.'
[05:30] <truepurple> sacarlson are you familar with the term "miniiso"?
[05:30] <sacarlson> truepurple: because it's not netinstaller it's unetbootin http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
[05:30] <mayo> chipzzz http://pastebin.com/LRBbC7YA
[05:30] <sacarlson> truepurple: yes mini.iso
[05:30] <navod> hi
[05:30] <kylemm> damn
[05:31] <kylemm> Dr_Willis: damn. Well if u happen to remember pm me
[05:31] <truepurple> sacarlson Where can I download mini iso?
[05:31] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  with xming, and the X '-query' feature. you could go old skool and have the X server display a whole desktop if you enable gdm to have the  proper XDMCP sesttings enabled..
[05:31] <navod> ya
[05:31] <truepurple> sacarlson net instal is a option WITHIN unetbootin
[05:31] <mayo> chipzzz...
[05:31] <kylemm> thx for telling me how u prob did it
[05:31] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  all i recall is i had to insxtall the drivers. then replace the xorg.conf at each boot  from rc.local, THEN started gdm from rc.local but that might all be fixed by noe.
[05:31] <WACOMalt> Dr_Willis: most confusing download page ever :P trying to find the package...
[05:31] <bazhang> truepurple, then read up on the unetbootin documents
[05:31]  * Da|Mummy gives it up for Fedor
[05:32] <sacarlson> truepurple: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[05:32] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  there were issues with uipdate/upgrading  because the live-usb setup i think CANT boot the newer kernels. you must use the original kernel/drivers
[05:32] <WACOMalt> found it :P
[05:32] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  i think theres basically just the one package you download/install..
[05:32] <Chipzzz> mayo: it seems to think you have a 5390, not a 3090
[05:32] <nit-wit> truepurple, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[05:32] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  rest are optionsl
[05:32] <sacarlson> truepurple: ok then you must have tried it and failed?
[05:32] <droidftw_> I <3 UBUNTU
[05:32] <kylemm> i got a question. If i am using this as a LIVECD, does it change anything on my actual comp? will it screw around with my hard drive files? will it mess up my ram or anything internal?
[05:33] <bazhang> sacarlson, not tried yet, apparently
[05:33] <droidftw_> JUST DID MY FIRST DUAL BOOT
[05:33] <droidftw_> SO AMAZING
[05:33] <FloodBot3> droidftw_: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[05:33] <rww> droidftw_: drop the caps, please
[05:33] <bazhang> droidftw_, ubuntu support question?
[05:33] <rww> kylemm: not unless you tell it to, no.
[05:33] <droidftw_> no
[05:33] <bazhang> droidftw_, #ubuntu-offtopic for chat please
[05:33] <rww> droidftw_: congrats, btw.
[05:33] <Starminn> kylemm: Nope. It doesn't even change the CD. Each time you boot from CD it'll be fresh again
[05:33] <kylemm> rww: well im planning to lend my LIVEUSB to my friend, and dont want his stuff getting messed up due to my USB. IF it does i will have to pay like $1000
[05:33] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  if you mount the HD.. and delete stuff.. yes the files will get deleted and so forth
[05:34] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  if you dont mount/acces the hds then no.
[05:34] <rww> kylemm: betting $1000 that someone else won't do something silly doesn't seem like a good idea
[05:34] <truepurple> sacarlson I was asking about downloading it directly to save space, time and complication.
[05:34] <kylemm> well hes computer smrt
[05:34] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  people use live usb's all the time to 'fix' broken windows pc's ...... so i dont get why you are even asking this. :)
[05:35] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  let him make his own live-usb then?
[05:35] <kylemm> well %100 it will not mess with anything if hes not stupid?
[05:35] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  you can also do a full/normal install to a flash drive.. but that can get confuseing in ways.. but more up to dateed stuff
[05:35] <truepurple> Sacarlson So this installs onto a pendrive just like a regular ISO, including the lack of being able to use any other space on the flashdrive?
[05:35] <sacarlson> truepurple: I don't see the mini.iso on the list of unetbootin so I think you need to download the file manualy http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
[05:35] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  if you dont mount the filesystems.. it wont access things.. he could still repartion his HD. :)
[05:36] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  or do some dd commands...
[05:36] <truepurple> sacarlson its under the name netinstall like I said...
[05:36] <truepurple> within unetbootin

[05:37] <sacarlson> truepurple: I'm clueless what your netinstall will do
[05:37] <WACOMalt> Dr_Willis: I am getting an X cursor and cherboard wallpaper on my Xming window
[05:37] <kylemm> lol
[05:37] <truepurple> sacarlson it should be the same in linux, anyway so with mini iso, that would be installed just like a regular ISO, including the inability to use the reset of the flash drives space?
[05:38] <sacarlson> truepurple: yes
[05:38] <truepurple> *rest of
[05:38] <truepurple> sacarlson Ok thanks
[05:38] <sacarlson> truepurple: until you install a real operating sytem to fix it
[05:38] <Chipzzz> mayo: good question... what makes you think it's a 3090?
[05:39] <truepurple> sacarlson I think it downloads and does that for you
[05:39] <sacarlson> truepurple: well if you want to play with it go for it
[05:40] <fabian> my computer with 10.10 frozen sometimes
[05:40] <sacarlson> truepurple: in the time you chated with me you could have tried 4 other things already
[05:40] <fabian> for example
[05:40] <truepurple> sacarlson considering the lack of space for a full live CD, I might not have another choice
[05:40] <fabian> i am listening music
[05:40] <kylemm> WELL
[05:40] <fabian> and it frozen
[05:40] <kylemm> heres some good news.
[05:40] <fabian> my english is bad
[05:41] <fabian> sorry
[05:41] <kylemm> i sent him a disclaimer.
[05:41] <mayo> because i clicked a link and it says it was the same driver
[05:41] <kylemm> so legally i cant get introuble if he messes up his comp
[05:41] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  legally? Hmm.. yea.. sure..  heh
[05:41] <pksadiq> fabian: does it happen usually when hearing in totem player? or does it happen in any player?
[05:41] <kylemm> ya
[05:41] <Dr_Willis> put a ELUA on it and a click through luicense. :)
[05:41] <kylemm> i sent him a disclaimer and he accepted
[05:41] <sacarlson> truepurple: if you didn't notice the file I gave you the link for is only 12 meg

[05:43] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  did you get it notorized and fingerprint-stamped and tripplesigned by  his mother? :)
[05:43] <kylemm> wtf how can you like SuoerTuxKart. ITS UBER SLOW
[05:43] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  sounds like the X server is going.. but no actual apps are running.
[05:43] <mayo> hello
[05:43] <WACOMalt> how to fix? O_o
[05:44] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  how are you even launching theis X server?
[05:44] <WACOMalt> XLaunch, as the "one screen" setup
[05:44] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  you mean via 'xming' ?
[05:44] <WACOMalt> yes, using xlaunch to make the config
[05:44] <konner> hi can someone help me install WoW
[05:44] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  have xming now launch some app like xterm, or gnome-terminal
[05:45] <Dr_Willis> !appdb | konner
[05:45] <ubottu> konner: The Wine Application DB is a database of applications and help for !Windows programs that run under !WINE: http://appdb.winehq.org - Join #winehq for application help
[05:45] <WACOMalt> how do I launch an application now? From a separate ssh?
[05:45] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  you told it to run 'startx' which i think is the only thing it ran, You can in theory ssh in, and with X forwarding enabled run stuff.
[05:45] <kylemm> Dr_Willis: if the operating system messes up with his comp can he sue me for money?
[05:45] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  and it shoud appear locally
[05:45] <mayo> hello
[05:45] <WACOMalt> I didnt make it run startx this time
[05:46] <WACOMalt> this is a separate session, I restarted the remote machine even
[05:46] <WACOMalt> Only thing I did was go through that wizard and choose "one screen for all applications" and give it my IP
[05:46] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  if you are worried about your 'friend' sueing you  and you are doing him a favor.. i wouldent be doing him the favor..
[05:46] <kylemm> well hes like a computer wiz
[05:46] <kylemm> and does CSS
[05:46] <kylemm> so will it only mess up his comp if hes stupid?
[05:46] <kylemm> lol
[05:46] <soreau> kylemm: What are you doing now?
[05:46] <kylemm> im chillin
[05:46] <soreau> kylemm: Did you install ubuntu yet?
[05:47] <robertzaccour> I noticed that when i do screencast video recording with a webcam open the video and audio lag and go out of sync. is it likely that xfce might save me here? I'm using Gnome now.
[05:47] <kylemm> soreau: no
[05:47] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  if he wants to destroy his pc.. he can.. the live cd can let him do that...

[05:47] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  if he ran the proper commands from a live cd.. he can eraase his hd...
[05:47] <kylemm> dr_willis this can be done with XP too
[05:47] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  same with any other live-setup/disk/bootable os...
[05:48] <kylemm> dr_Willis: so its basically like any operating system. It wont do anything bad to ur comp, unless you use it that way
[05:48] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:  right.. same with xp.. so i dont see why you are being so worried about all this legal/sue stuff.
[05:48] <Dr_Willis> kylemm:   if he mounts/accesses his hard drives.. he can access th files...
[05:48] <Dr_Willis> if he repartuions the Hard disks.. they will get repartioned...

[05:49] <WACOMalt> kk
[05:49] <soreau> kylemm: work to do what?
[05:49] <juniour> hi

[05:49] <soreau> kylemm: sure
[05:49] <kostmo> One commenter mentioned "padevchooser" as being capable of this, but it doesn't seem to be (on Maverick)
[05:49] <neil> hi, I am looking for a software in 10.10 to convert 3GP videos, can anyone help me ?
[05:50] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  i seem to recall that gdm2 did not even have the XDMCP feature. thats how (in the old days) you could do a X -query and see all machines on the network that would let you do a 'remote login with full desktop'
[05:50] <AbhijiT> neil, arista transocder
[05:50] <juniour> hey when i drag the window it comes to late to drag place
[05:50] <bazhang> neil, ffmpeg
[05:50] <AbhijiT> :/
[05:50] <rww> Dr_Willis: I think gdm2 had it and gdm3 doesn't.
[05:51] <kostmo> My question is, does anything exists that allows me to do what is in this screenshot mockup? http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/23754/
[05:51] <neil> bazhang, r u talking abt the plugin of ffmpeg?
[05:51] <bazhang> kostmo, padevchooser is in the repos for 10.10
[05:51] <Dr_Willis> rww:  yea the whole numbering scheme gets cnfuseing. :) ive not used the feature in at least 2 years. so havent even tried it.
[05:51] <bazhang> neil, just ffmpeg
[05:51] <bazhang> !info padevchooser | kostmo
[05:51] <ubottu> kostmo: padevchooser (source: padevchooser): PulseAudio Device Chooser. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.9.3-2ubuntu4 (maverick), package size 19 kB, installed size 132 kB
[05:51] <kostmo> bazhang, yes, I am running it currently - but I don't see a way to choose the sink
[05:51] <WACOMalt> Hmm... so I have GDM3 then?  so is this sort of full desktop feature even available any more? (if not.. why would they phase that out?!)
[05:51] <kylemm> Dr_Willis: if i create a screenshot, then transfer it to my HD, will i see it on windows VISTA
[05:52] <juniour> hey when i drag the window it comes to late to drag place
[05:52] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  its old and was insecure, and vnc/ssh/freenx was better at it.
[05:52] <WACOMalt> so this ISNT ssh?
[05:52] <juniour> hey when i drag the window it comes to late to drag place why it is like that
[05:52] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  the old xdm, or older gdm. can do it.. but it was just a feature that not a lot of people used any more
[05:52] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  this predates ssh by a great many years.
[05:52] <WACOMalt> :/
[05:52] <neil> bazhang, i m getting 11 applications when i type ffmpeg in the search box but none of them matches the name
[05:52] <WACOMalt> VNC is slower, freeNX is less compatible...
[05:52] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  XDMCP   is  a special way to  remote display X.    ssh can do 'x forawrding'
[05:52] <WACOMalt> :/
[05:53] <maco> WACOMalt: it isnt ssh and it's also horribulously insecure
[05:53] <Dr_Willis> XDMCP predates vnc  by a great many years also.
[05:53] <WACOMalt> gotcha
[05:53] <bazhang> neil, from where? you might want to get the medibuntu.org version as well
[05:53] <Dr_Willis> I think the term is XDMCP.. its been so long
[05:53] <WACOMalt> so.. can you do x forwarding of the full session?
[05:53] <neil> bazhang, im using ubunutu 10.10
[05:53] <bazhang> neil, yes I know. check medibuntu.org for their version
[05:53] <kostmo> bazhang, In the "Output" tab of the default "Sound Preferences" application I see 3 distinct output devices, but none of them are listed in the PulseAudio applet
[05:54] <mayo> how do i do a modprobe of a driver?
[05:54] <WACOMalt> if I can find an actual working freenx client for windows Id be set I guess
[05:54] <Dr_Willis> freenx actually uses ssh   so thats part of why its  considered more secure
[05:54] <v_> Does anyone knows for  software for seeing partitions of Hard Disk ?
[05:54] <Dr_Willis> You DONT want to use xmdmcp over the wild and nasty internet. :)
[05:54] <AbhijiT> v_, gparted
[05:54] <maco> v_: sudo fdisk -l
[05:54] <bazhang> v_ gparted as I said before
[05:55] <mayo> how do i modprobe

[05:55] <WACOMalt> Dr_Willis: any chance you know of a workign setup for FreeNX and Windows?
[05:55] <WACOMalt> I have NoMachine's but it seems to flat out fail
[05:55] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  not really. i got freenx sort of working once.. (or whatever the other nx cvariant is) and had quirky issues with it.. so went back to vnc.
[05:56] <kostmo> bazhang, What I do see in the left-click menu of the pa applet is an option for "Default Sink", whose submenu only lists "Default" and "Other..."
[05:56] <Dr_Willis> the whole 'NX' stuff needs a bit of work.
[05:56] <WACOMalt> fark.
[05:56] <WACOMalt> so really VNC is my only option?
[05:56] <Dr_Willis> the ubuntu nx wiki pages.. were a bit confuseing last i checked also. they mention using one 'nx' variant, then jump to a differnet vbariant.
[05:56] <mayo> how do i install a driver i downloaded?
[05:56] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  it all depends on the details of what you need and want.
[05:56] <AbhijiT> mayo, is it.tar.g
[05:56] <WACOMalt> or figuring the Full screen X11 forwarding from ssh...
[05:57] <AbhijiT> mayo, is it.tar.gz
[05:57] <mayo> ?
[05:57] <WACOMalt> I want VNC, but faster if possible
[05:57] <mayo> not sure what you mean
[05:57] <bazhang> mayo, from the PPA?
[05:57] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  i recall seting up xming to launch 'xterm' in a fullscreen window that i then ran the normal X desktop from.
[05:57] <mayo> no
[05:57] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  local lan? internet? wireless networking? what desktop....
[05:57] <mayo> from the ralink.com
[05:57] <mayo> its a driver
[05:58] <WACOMalt> internet, XFCE on ubuntu 10.04 server, Client is Windows 7 laptop
[05:58] <bazhang> mayo, you said you were using the PPA before; did you purge it yet?
[05:58] <mayo> i have a zip file
[05:58] <mayo> no?
[05:58] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  if you trim down your desktop. vnc can work decently well. but you DONT want to use vnc over the internet. unless you ssh tunnle it.
[05:58] <mayo> what is that?
[05:58] <mayo> what do you mean?
[05:58] <WACOMalt> can you teach me how to do that?  would that also improve performance?
[05:58] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  running a single app via ssh/forwarding would be the 'fastest' i imagine and simplist.
[05:58] <Dr_Willis> !vnc
[05:58] <ubottu> VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[05:58] <mayo> now i'm using a driver in a zip file
[05:59] <WACOMalt> thanks
[05:59] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  ssh tunnling would make it worse i imagine.
[05:59] <WACOMalt> ah
[05:59] <bazhang> !info ppa-purge | mayo
[05:59] <ubottu> mayo: ppa-purge (source: ppa-purge): disables a PPA and reverts to official packages. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.2.7.1+bzr53 (maverick), package size 5 kB, installed size 56 kB
[05:59] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:  not using xfce but using somtjhing like icewm, or other Minimal desktop woild help.
[06:00] <WACOMalt> Well, givin the amount of time it took for me to get this computer even usable, I'll probably just stick with the slow, but working vnc. Over ssh I guess.   Thanks for all the pointers here
[06:00] <mayo> why do i need to do that?
[06:00] <Dr_Willis> WACOMalt:    in theory if you got xterm, or xfterminal, running via xming/xlaunch in a 'full screen window/desktop' it should then let you launch the rest of the desktop
[06:00] <bazhang> mayo, you said you were using the ppa before; lets see your sources.list please
[06:00] <snimavat> whts wrong with this simple shell script http://pastebin.com/wCRdJizM

[06:00] <snimavat> it says /home/sudhir/bin/switchg: line 3: GRAILS_1.3.5=/home/sudhir/softwares/grails-1.3.5/: No such file or directory. The directory exists though
[06:01] <mayo> i told you that didn't work
[06:01] <mayo> now i'm just asking how to install a driver
[06:01] <bazhang> mayo, we're not even sure that you installed the actual package; what was the exact command you used to add that PPA
[06:01] <Dr_Willis> snimavat:  you do have the 'CaSe' Correct of all items?
[06:02] <snimavat> Dr_Willis: yes
[06:02] <mayo> i cant sy i remember
[06:02] <bazhang> mayo, randomly installing a lot of 3rd party drivers without cleaning up the PPA is not going to help out troubleshooting
[06:02] <mayo> say
[06:02] <markskilbeck> Off topic question... is twitter loading properly for everyone?
[06:02] <markskilbeck> :D
[06:02] <mayo> how do i clean it up?
[06:03] <bazhang> using the ppa-purge that I just gave you info about mayo

[06:04] <markskilbeck> Yet the site isn't working for me.
[06:04] <mayo> i really need this to work
[06:04] <snimavat> in shellscript, how do i check if file/directory exists?
[06:05] <bazhang> mayo, then follow through and give the info needed
[06:05] <markskilbeck> I think the universe is doing its best to keep me from tweeting/

[06:19] <almoxarife> chrome can't use blank as home page? odd

[06:19] <maco> bullgard: the command to see the return code for the last command run is `echo $?`
[06:20] <alesan> markskilbeck, and also I like in firefox you can "paste" a link in the browser area with the middle button
[06:20] <markskilbeck> Well, almoxarife, the closest to it I think is the 'Most Visiting/Recently Closed' page.
[06:20] <alesan> and that is not possible wit chrome
[06:20] <juniour> markskilbeck wt ?
[06:20] <alesan> and then chrome wants to override the window manager

[06:20] <markskilbeck> juniour: I said "Good morning" in Greek.
[06:20] <markskilbeck> alesan: I'm with you there, actually.
[06:21] <markskilbeck> Ever since iTunes on windows, I've had an issue with non-standard windows.
[06:21] <rww> Chromium has an option to use standard window decorations. It looks silly, but nevertheless.
[06:21] <Khisanth> iarp: changing the group of the file/directory to www-data would let it access your stuff but that is probably a bad idea
[06:21] <juniour> markskilbeck good morning
[06:21] <almoxarife> markskilbeck: I just opened about:blank in chromium, I will assume if that was my home page I would have one big blank
[06:21] <alesan> I know chrome is faster for high-intensity javascript pages but... on normal sites I do not see a difference

[06:22] <markskilbeck> "Vivi- ... um?"
[06:22] <rww> markskilbeck: True, but given that Firefox draws widgets its own way (though granted, it does a better job of emulating GTK or Qt if you configure it right)...
[06:23] <markskilbeck> That's a slightly contrived joke. +10 points if you 'get' it.
[06:23] <almoxarife> alesan: and it works great in chrome too :) the 64bit flash that is

[06:41] <markskilbeck> kapipiert: you use MSSQL on Ubuntu?
[06:41] <jr200747> bash: s/run/execute: No such file or directory
[06:41] <paris> soreau!, you have to lead me step by step how to do it, if you don't mind?
[06:41]  * markskilbeck facepalm
[06:41] <kapipiert> markskilbeck: nop. i need to connect to external db
[06:42] <markskilbeck> jr200747: look in the archive you extracted, and see if there's a binary in there.
[06:42] <markskilbeck> If so, execute it.
[06:42] <kapipiert> how ?
[06:42] <markskilbeck> How what?
[06:42] <Dr_Willis> jr200747:  you might want to spend some time and learn some more linux fundamentals/command line basics also if you are new to linux.
[06:42] <kapipiert> how i can see all tables lik phpmyadmin tools
[06:42] <kapipiert> i whant gui fot it
[06:43] <bullgard> Why does the process [pm] not appear in pstree?
[06:43] <Khisanth> jr200747: do you have the java runtime packages installed?
[06:43] <soreau> paris: 1) Open a terminal (applications>accessories>Terminal) 2) Type lsusb 3) Press enter 4) Look for the line that corresponds to the device 5) Paste that line here
[06:43] <MrMookie> how should I link to a local file from inside this php line? <a href='file:///\\Localserver\public\text.txt'>$title</a></td>\n";
[06:43] <jr200747> Khisanth: yes
[06:43] <markskilbeck> I'd've assumed with MSSQL you'd get some database browser with it.
[06:43] <Khisanth> jr200747: so what do you get when you run charles/bin/charles.sh?
[06:44] <Khisanth> hmm the executable bit doesn't seem to be set for that
[06:44] <Khisanth> you'll need to chmod +x it first
[06:44] <markskilbeck> MrMookie: #php ;)
[06:44] <MrMookie> ;)
[06:44] <markskilbeck> Only joking. Don't go there.
[06:44] <jr200747> Khisanth: you talking to me?
[06:44] <Khisanth> yes ...
[06:44] <jr200747> pm m8?
[06:45] <Khisanth> there isn't anymore to say, just make it executable and it should run
[06:45] <markskilbeck> jr200747: let me ssh into your box. I'll fix it for you. No charge. I won't go looking through your stuff for dirty photos.
[06:45] <Dr_Willis> seems that 'charles' also wants the SUN java. not the icedtea java (from the faq) and you must use this firefox extension also.
[06:45] <Dr_Willis> The following add-on is required to autoconfigure the Firefox proxy settings. Just download and install it using Firefox.
[06:46] <paris> soreau, that what I got from line 5: Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
[06:46] <Khisanth> that would mean you don't need if it you configure the proxy settings yourself :)
[06:46] <Dr_Willis> Khisanth:  i see no mention of what settings to even use. and the addon i think does some other things. (from what little docs I do find on it)
[06:48] <Abhinav> HELP!! I am not able to play a UDF DVD in Movie Player! It saya "Location not found"
[06:49] <soreau> Abhinav: maybe it cant find the location
[06:49] <Abhinav> But it is mounted!
[06:49] <Dr_Willis> well charles seems to be workuing here.. No idea what its actully used for.. :)
[06:49] <soreau> Abhinav: umount it
[06:49] <markskilbeck> kapipiert: there are a few tools for UI-based browsing of an MSSQL database.
[06:49] <markskilbeck> For example: http://www.razorsql.com/docs/sqlserver_database_browser.html
[06:50] <ghosTM55> hi all
[06:50] <markskilbeck> Dr_Willis: it's a proxy, apparently.
[06:50] <Abhinav> soreu: done
[06:50] <soreau> Abhinav: Try totem /path/to/movie.iso
[06:50] <Dr_Willis> markskilbeck:  its displaying a lot of connection info, times, and speeds also. so its a debugging proxy :)
[06:50] <Abhinav> soreau: its not an iso
[06:50] <Khisanth> Dr_Willis: debugging http requests and you are probably right about the plugin, at the very least I would expect it to automatically disable the proxy if it doesn't detect charles running
[06:50] <kapipiert> markskilbeck: thanks
[06:50] <soreau> Abhinav: oh what is it?
[06:50] <Abhinav> soreau: Its a DVD in UDF format
[06:51] <kapipiert> maybe you have more ?
[06:51] <soreau> Abhinav: Try totem /dev/sr0
[06:51] <soreau> Abhinav: or sr1 for the second drive.. or /dev/cdrom
[06:51] <Abhinav> soreau: It says could not read from source
[06:52] <soreau> Abhinav: If it's mounted, run 'mount' and see what /dev/node it is
[06:52] <soreau> Abhinav: Then pass that as an arg to totem
[06:52] <markskilbeck> ghisen: it's illiterate. Ask for a replacement.
[06:53] <rajvi> 10.10 meerkat on dell netbook every apps gets installed but returns an "-1 exit code " strange huh ??
[06:53] <bencahill> hey, what does gnome build it's menu (Applications and such) from?
[06:53] <Dr_Willis> bencahill:  from dozens/hundereds of foo.desktop files.
[06:54] <markskilbeck> rajvi: what, through apt-get?
[06:54] <soreau> rajvi: What are you talking about?
[06:54] <Dr_Willis> bencahill:  the .desktop spec i think is part of the freedesktop.org foundation specs.
[06:54] <rolandpish> how can I run manually cron jobs that are inside /etc/cron.d ?
[06:54] <rajvi> i m a newbie
[06:54] <Dr_Willis> bencahill:  gdm also uses them.
[06:54] <Abhinav> soreau: its the same error
[06:54] <maco> soreau: postinst scripts i think
[06:54] <bencahill> Dr_Willis, the ones in .local/share/applications/ ?
[06:54] <rajvi> i m a newbie
[06:54] <rww> bencahill: amongst other places, yes.
[06:54] <markskilbeck> Roland: um... execute whatever is in /etc/cron.d
[06:55] <rww> bencahill: /usr/share/applications/, for example
[06:55] <Dr_Willis> bencahill:  those are user specific. theres others.  'locate gnome-terminal.desktop' (for example) --> /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop
[06:55] <bencahill> rww, right, ok, thanks
[06:55] <rajvi> please help
[06:55] <bencahill> Dr_Willis, ok, thanks
[06:55] <soreau> ! details | rajvi
[06:55] <ubottu> rajvi: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[06:56] <juniour> rajiv ask the problem buddy
[06:56] <juniour> ?
[06:56] <rolandpish> markskilbeck, thanks, but files under /etc/cron.d don't seem to be scripts, the two files in there contains "cron" lines.
[06:57] <rajvi> i have a problem with insatlled any apps or packages on 10.10 meerkat the app gets installed but returns an error code stating that the installation has failed but th app get install sucessfully
[06:57] <bencahill> rajvi, how are you installing said applications?
[06:57] <markskilbeck> rajvi: is that all the error says?
[06:58] <DareDevil01> Hey guys i got a question what kind of software can i use for a Upnp server in ubuntu linux?
[06:58] <rajvi> ubuntu software update
[06:58] <bullgard> Why does the process [pm] not appear in the output of pstree?
[06:59] <rajvi> when i authorize to install apps teh authorizewith freezes
[06:59] <markskilbeck> rajvi: you might try sudo apt-get clean && apt-get update
[06:59] <Abhinav> soreau: ?? you there?
[06:59] <rajvi> ok i will that do
[07:00] <soreau> Abhinav: I don't know what to tell you other than..
[07:00] <soreau> ! dvd | Abhinav
[07:00] <ubottu> Abhinav: Ubuntu's default installation and repositories do not include packages needed to play commercial DVDs for legal reasons. For information on adding them, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs | For information on the legalities involved, see the "DVD" section of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[07:00] <DareDevil01> software for upnp server in ubuntu?
[07:00] <Chipzzz> rolandpish: try crontab -l
[07:00] <Dr_Willis> DareDevil01:  i think some exists. ive never really messed with them. Not sure if theres any in the repos or not. try the search feature of the pacakge manager.
[07:01] <rajvi> i have a question can u take a remote of my system
[07:01] <markskilbeck> DareDevil01: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=upnp+server+ubuntu
[07:01] <bencahill> rajvi, not a good idea
[07:01] <markskilbeck> Pretty rude, lmgtfy.com, isn't it?
[07:01] <rajvi> i can trust u guys right
[07:01] <Dr_Willis> mediatomb - UPnP MediaServer (main package)
[07:01] <bencahill> lol
[07:01] <Abhinav> soreau: thanx!
[07:01] <DareDevil01> thank you
[07:02] <Dr_Willis> rajvi:  if the pacakges are installing..  is theres some other issue breaking things?
[07:02] <soreau> rajvi: No remote desktop. Just ask your question in detail
[07:02] <Dr_Willis> rajvi:  they do work?
[07:02] <rajvi> last time i m trying
[07:02] <Dr_Willis> DareDevil01:  i found meditomb a little.. odd to work with. :)
[07:03] <vas> <unconvertable> <unconvertable>
[07:03] <rolandpish> Chipzzz, thanks, executing crontab -l lists cron jobs under /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root (I'm logged as root right now). I would like to execute cron jobs under /etc/cron.d just to test if they execute correctly.
[07:03] <DareDevil01> Dr_Willis, why is that?, which other you know that can be good?
[07:03] <Dr_Willis> DareDevil01:  just how it worked.. try it and see.
[07:04] <robertzaccour> what do i need to install to make my system like ubuntu studio as far as multimedia codecs and kernel tweaking go?
[07:04] <DareDevil01> Dr_Willis, which other you know other than mediatomb?
[07:04] <Dr_Willis> DareDevil01:  i needed to share things as a 'series' wife wanted all of 'rosanne'  where she could just slect and play.. that was not how it seemed to ork.
[07:04] <Dr_Willis> DareDevil01:  no idea. I rarely mess with it. i just set up samba shares for the wife
[07:04] <rajvi> when i authorize to install a app the authorize window frezes if i close it i see the installation progress bar but after installation it say the installation has failed but actually the softies DO GETS installed exit code:-1
[07:04] <bullgard> How to determine what process spawns a certain process?
[07:04] <Dr_Willis> rajvi:  when in doubt fall back to the command line.  it will give more detailed info/errors.
[07:05] <rajvi> i m a newbie
[07:05] <DareDevil01> Dr_Willis, so what you mean is that there is no big management of the media that you share?
[07:05] <phrac> DareDevil01: fuppes will do what you want
[07:05] <Dr_Willis> rajvi:  i would start with opening a terminal, and try ing 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get upgrade'  and look for any errors
[07:05] <DareDevil01> phrac, than you
[07:06] <Dr_Willis> DareDevil01:  i dont manage them more then to 'share them all with the wifes pc....'
[07:06] <DareDevil01> ok
[07:06] <bullgard> rajvi: "You are a nebie." Are you so new that you cannot put a comma and full stop?
[07:06] <Dr_Willis> DareDevil01:  her new OPlay had a upnp browser feature. that was the only reason  i messed with mediatomb
[07:07] <markskilbeck> bullgard: are you trying to steal my much coveted Grammar Nazi badge?
[07:07] <bencahill> bullgard, you mean an apostrophe?
[07:07] <rajvi> i appolize for my naiveness
[07:07] <bazhang> markskilbeck, the excessive commentary is not needed nor welcome. Please refrain
[07:07] <markskilbeck> rajvi: don't bother. Everyone's a newbie at some point.
[07:07] <Dr_Willis> rajvi: getting back to the actual problem -->  i would start with opening a terminal, and try ing 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get upgrade'  and look for any errors
[07:08] <Dr_Willis> rajvi:  the gui package manager tools may have some quirky bugs you are seeing. i rarely use them.
[07:09] <Dr_Willis> DareDevil01:  seems to be a few other upnp servers/tools in the repos as well.  ushare - lightweight UPnP A/V Media Server
[07:10] <DareDevil01> fuppes seems really good, i am reading about it right now
[07:10] <rajvi> DR_Willis i think u r right
[07:13] <mopeyennui> Hello.
[07:13] <silentmind> can cp use the same directory as SOURCE when copying files?
[07:13] <Dr_Willis> DareDevil01:  ushare seems to fit what i need. :)  even supports playlists.
[07:13] <silentmind> i.e. can I avoid passing a full path for both source and dest
[07:13] <mopeyennui> I got a small problem. My arrow keys launch a program... I don't have xbindkey. I can't open metacity.. where might I find such a setting?

=== markskilbeck is now known as BingSuperCoolGuy
[07:14] <Chipzzz> silentmind: yes but to avoid using the path, you must have cd'd to that directory
[07:15] <Dr_Willis> rajvi:  if the update and upgrade dont give any errors. try installing somthing 'sudo apt-get install cheese' (for example)
[07:15] <silentmind> Chipzzz: thanks
[07:15] <bencahill> silentmind, you can use relative paths for source and dest
=== BingSuperCoolGuy is now known as markskilbeck
[07:16] <bencahill> silentmind, . = current dir, so ./* would be all files in the current dir, e.g.
[07:17] <silentmind> bencahill: I do that atm but sometimes need to copy deeply nested files, I don't like cd'ing in and out all the time :)
[07:17] <bencahill> silentmind, and just in case you didn't know, .. goes up a dir, so if you're in /home/user1, you could put ../user2 instead of /home/user2
[07:17] <bencahill> silentmind, ah
[07:18] <Chipzzz> silentmind: you can copy recursively with cp -r
[07:18] <bencahill> silentmind, although a small tip, cd wih no args goes back to ~
[07:18] <bencahill> s/wih/with/
[07:20] <silentmind> Chipzzz: not sure how that could help me ...? Just copying one file (a template) into the same dir, but the path may be deeply nested
[07:20] <silentmind> bencahill: didn't know that, thanks
[07:20] <theyLive> i disabled automatic updates yet the damn update window keeps popping up.
[07:21] <shentino> How do I change which vt my gdm starts on?
[07:21] <theyLive> how do quiet this thing?
[07:21] <markskilbeck> silentmind: so you'd like the directory structure to be created from moving a file?
[07:21] <markskilbeck> from the file you are moving*
[07:22] <silentmind> "cp foo/bar/hello/greet.txt world.txt" instead of "cp foo/bar/hello/greet.txt foo/bar/hello/world.txt"
[07:22] <mopeyennui> Do i have to take a ticket in here?
[07:22] <markskilbeck> theyLive: I seem to remember removing that application from the startup applications area.
[07:23] <mopeyennui> (I'm only anxious because turning the arrow keys into shortcuts to launch a program is annoying.)
[07:23] <markskilbeck> mopeyennui: Just Ask (tm)
[07:23] <Chipzzz> he asked but I don't think anyone knows
[07:24] <mopeyennui> -0Okay.. for some reason Home, End, PgUp, PgDn, and the arrow keys are launching a program.
[07:24] <mopeyennui> I do not have xbindkeys installed.
[07:24] <mopeyennui> What kinds of things could be causing this?
[07:24] <soreau> mopeyennui: What program are they launching?
[07:24] <mopeyennui> Rythembox
[07:24] <soreau> mopeyennui: Which window manager are you running?
[07:25] <mopeyennui> How do I check.. it's a default install.

[07:25] <theyLive> markskilbeck, seems like thats the trick. update notifier is in there
[07:25] <theyLive> thanks
[07:26] <soreau> mopeyennui: ps ax|egrep "metacity|compiz"
[07:26] <markskilbeck> theyLive: no problem. That annoyed me for months.
=== LjL-Temp is now known as Guest7810
[07:26] <Loshki> bullgard: processes often know their parent pid, ps axf
[07:26] <mopeyennui> soreau: I admit, i'm a newb. What was that?
[07:27] <markskilbeck> mopeyennui: it's a couple of commands for you to execute.
[07:28] <soreau> mopeyennui: 1) Open a terminal (Applications>Accessories>Terminal) 2) Type ps ax|egrep "metacity|compiz"|grep -v grep 3) Press enter 4) Show the output here
[07:29] <bullgard> Loshki: Thank you very much for your help.
[07:30] <mopeyennui> 9No output
[07:30] <mopeyennui> It can be typed in, but only brings a new line up.
[07:32] <markskilbeck> You'd've expected the metacity or compiz process to be shown
[07:33] <mopeyennui> 9Oh hell.
[07:33] <versificator> morning, what happened to Intrepid?  does it get totally removed off all the servers when support ends?
[07:33] <soreau> mopeyennui: Do your windows have borders? Can you move them with Alt+Drag? Is this kde or lxde?
[07:33] <mopeyennui> 0-GNOME
[07:34] <mopeyennui> Gnome
[07:34] <markskilbeck> mopeyennui: clean install?
[07:34] <bullgard> versificator: No.
[07:35] <Chipzzz> Why do mopeyennui's lines often begin with numbers?...
[07:35] <versificator> bullgard: can't find 8.10 on http://releases.ubuntu.com/ is it archived elsewhere?
[07:35] <soreau> mopeyennui: Well typically metacity or compiz would be running. In any event, try gnome-keybinding-properties and see if those keys are bound to anything
[07:35] <Chipzzz> Something going on with his keyboard?
[07:35] <bullgard> versificator: Yes.
[07:35] <ardchoille> mopeyennui: are  you using an nvidia card with the 96 drivers?
[07:35] <markskilbeck> Chipzzz: his native language is obviously Numbers.
[07:35] <Da|Mummy> i have a 2.4ghz rf wireless controller, how do i get ubuntu to recognize(before any smartass answers, yes i do have the usb dongle that comes with the controller to connect wirelessly)
[07:36] <soreau> mopeyennui: or ccsm>General>Commands
[07:36] <mopeyennui> The numbers are a known issue with me pressing non letter keys,.
[07:36] <mopeyennui> Or just typoing
[07:36] <Chipzzz> Not finding fault... I'm wondering if it is connected to his problem
[07:36] <Prinler> Hey everyone
[07:36] <green> Hello, im having truble with my wireless, it says its " disabled by hardware switch" but I click the switch and the computer wont respond to it... Than you
[07:37] <green> *thank--
[07:37] <mopeyennui> Here's something - I can use arrow keys in gnome menus but not with other programs.s
[07:38] <soreau> green: Check the output of 'dmesg' from your terminal or run 'sudo tail -f /var/log/messages' to monitor the output when you press the button
[07:38] <Prinler> I sure love errors on boot :(
[07:38] <markskilbeck> Arrow keys are the devil.
[07:38] <markskilbeck> j + k, all the way.
[07:39] <mopeyennui> ...
[07:40] <Da|Mummy> so how do i get 2.4 ghz wireless to work on ubuntu?
[07:40] <Prinler> super glue
[07:41] <Da|Mummy> this might just be the one thing that superglue cant fix...beign wireless and all

[07:42] <KatronixSerf> Hi all, I recently upgraded my NVidia drivers, and found with the most recent kernel I have its preventing me from booting into X windows with the following error in dmesg: http://pastebin.com/4tBXgvnu how can I upgrade the kernel drivers so that they are all happy?
[07:42] <versificator> does ubuntu server have the full disk encryption option like the desktop alternate installers?
[07:42] <kenapa> versificator
[07:44] <robertzaccour> can i install an ubuntu alternate with wireless internet?
[07:44] <Dr_Willis> robertzaccour:  clarify what you mean.
[07:44] <kenapa> robertzaccour
[07:44] <versificator> he probably doesn't have a cat5 connection
[07:44] <markskilbeck> Specifically "ubuntu alternate"
[07:45] <KatronixSerf> anyone?
[07:45] <robertzaccour> Dr_Willis, with the alternate install iso on a disc/usb can i install it with wireless internet? i don't have wired
[07:45] <Prinler> KatherineD_,
[07:45] <versificator> i'd be surprised if it couldn't robertzaccour since even debian can install over wless
[07:46] <Dr_Willis> robertzaccour:  it can INSTALL with no networking... it might have drivers foryour wireless built in.
[07:46] <Prinler> KatronixSerf, if the kernel is not happy, you dont get no chicken
[07:46] <bullgard> Why does the process [pm] not appear in the output of pstree?
[07:46] <versificator> robertzaccour: what is your wless card model?
[07:46] <kenapa> CANADA!
[07:46] <kenapa> CANADA!
[07:46] <kenapa> CANADA!
[07:46] <FloodBot1> kenapa: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[07:46] <robertzaccour> versificator, my wireless works, using it right now on ubuntu
[07:46] <KatronixSerf> Prinler, Ok, how do I make it happy? would this require a custom install?
[07:46] <soreau> So anyways, I have a bluetooth headset and dongle combo but sometimes it will go to 'sleep' when there's no audio output then when there is output and it wakes up, the sound will be choppy until I select the lesser grade output for the device (telephony duplex HSP/HFP) and switch back to the higher grade (High Fidelity Playback A2DP) or otherwise reload/reset the device
[07:46] <Chipzzz> KatronixSerf: you could boot into X using the recovery console's frame buffer video, remove your old drivers, reboot with the open source nVidia drivers and install the new proprietary ones
[07:47] <mopeyennui> I'm back.
[07:47] <kenapa> CANADA!
[07:47] <kenapa> CANADA!

[07:47] <yoann973> Hi dear community ! I am a brand new user of Linux, and I look for some help on graphic tablet issues (intuos 2), any expert available ? Have a good day all of you !
[07:47] <Prinler> I always reinstall my linux after a major hardware change
[07:47] <versificator> robertzaccour: yeah but does the alt _installer_ cd have the drivers in its kernel --that's the rub
[07:47] <soreau> How can I get the device to always wake up in a proper state?
[07:47] <Dr_Willis> KatronixSerf:  you could remove the old nvidia drivers via the command line also. if you wanted.

[07:49] <Prinler> took me 2 seconds to google that KatronixSerf
[07:50] <mopeyennui> How do I launch metacity?
[07:50] <bullgard> Why does the process [pm] not appear in the output of pstree?
[07:51] <mopeyennui> Completly ruined the usability of this system.
[07:51] <elise001> hi
[07:51] <markskilbeck> mopeyennui: the 'metacity' command
[07:51] <Prinler> bullgard, http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&hl=en&safe=off&q=Why+does+the+process+%5Bpm%5D+not+appear+in+the+output+of+pstree%3F&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&pbx=1&fp=649be7798417a8e0
[07:51] <markskilbeck> Sans quotes, of course.
[07:52] <mopeyennui> I had to add ' --replace' to 'metacity' to get it to do something.. gflashed the display
[07:52] <Da|Mummy> damnit...
[07:52] <Da|Mummy> anyone have any idea how to get my 2.4ghz rf wireless + receiver to work in ubuntu?
[07:52] <elise001> hi
[07:52] <Dr_Willis> Da|Mummy:  totally depends on its chipset i imagine.
[07:53] <Prinler> da mummy what wireless card?
[07:53] <markskilbeck> mopeyennui: does metacity alleviate the issue?
[07:53] <Da|Mummy> its a simple 3rd party ps3 controller
[07:53] <mopeyennui> No.
[07:53] <elise001> hi
[07:53] <Da|Mummy> its got a usb dongle receiver
[07:53] <Prinler> http://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/networking/8259-making-wireless-work-in-ubuntu
[07:53] <Da|Mummy> i cant get it to pair though
[07:53] <Prinler> da mummy go here
[07:54] <Da|Mummy> that better not be about wifi internet...
=== markskilbeck is now known as Da|Daddy
[07:54] <Dr_Willis> Da|Mummy:  Your original question did not say what the device was..
[07:54] <Da|Mummy> i knew it!
[07:54] <versificator> anyone here use ubuntu server?
[07:54] <Prinler> mummy what the hell is the difference?
[07:54] <Dr_Willis> and as far as i know that thing should not be driver specific.
[07:54] <Da|Mummy> Dr_Willis, its a DreamGear Lava Glow ps3 wireless controller
[07:55] <Dr_Willis> Da|Mummy:  pair it on a ps3 and then move it over perhaps.
[07:55] <Prinler> getting the device to work for any reason(doesnt matter) internet or not
[07:55] <Dr_Willis> Da|Mummy:  also check dmesg output when you plug it in.
[07:55] <robertzaccour> so i should be able to alternate install with a rtl8191se card?
[07:55] <Dr_Willis> Prinler:  its a wireless gamepad.. shouldent have any special drivers or anythign else on the linxu side. If its seen as a normal ps3 controller.
[07:56] <Da|Mummy> its worked on windows
[07:56] <Dr_Willis> robertzaccour:   the Install should work.. the wireless may work.   if you did not have to do any fancy setup for that wireless on a normal install.
[07:56] <Da|Mummy> and its worked on ps3
[07:56] <Dr_Willis> Da|Mummy:  i dont even know if Linxu has support for normal ps3 controlllers.. ive never tried them
[07:57] <Dovid> Hi. Can anyone help me with this error ? http://h6315.com/ubuntu_disk_error.jpg
[07:57] <Da|Mummy> this isnt normal ps3 controller, normal is regular ol blutooth and yes linux supports it
[07:57] <Dovid> can I reboot and work on it ? or should i replace the disk first ?
[07:57] <Da|Mummy> i cant figure out this 2.4ghx rf thing though
[07:58] <Dr_Willis> Da|Mummy:  bluetooth can be problematic.   I would ahve to suggest checking the forums. ive basically given up on bluetooth.
[07:58] <bsmith093> quick syntax question, how do i remove a folder and everything under it including subfolders?
[07:58] <Dr_Willis> bsmith093:  rm -r foo
[07:58] <Dr_Willis> bsmith093:  rm -rf foo (perhaps)
[07:58] <Dovid> bsmith093: rm -rf /folder/path
[07:58] <Dr_Willis> bsmith093:  use with CARE
[07:59] <Da|Mummy> whole lotta care
[07:59] <Dovid> i had a client that had rm -rf / in a cron job. oops
[07:59] <versificator> if it starts to ask you alot of questions, you prolly have rm aliased to rm -i
[07:59] <versificator> i know tha'ts in some .bashrcs
[07:59] <Da|Mummy> heres what dmesg tells me about the receiver http://pastebin.com/GP1C25Pd
[07:59] <Prinler> umbuntu = amazing
