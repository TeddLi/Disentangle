[15:28] <linda> okay
[15:28] <cens0red> linda I remember seeing a howto up there about how to set up usb devices.
[15:28] <Wirwing> tux: just search for mp3 in sypnaptic, and install the right packages, there are the necessary codecs to play mp3 files
[15:29] <oshi> morning all
[15:29] <jrib> Docfxit: strange that the gui did not work.  I tried a similar example here and it seemed to work okay
[15:29] <Asra> morning? :D .. its 4:30 in the afternoon here
[15:29] <bazhang> tux ubuntu-restricted-extras
[15:29] <acrimo> prince_jammys: yes, it gets all the way to the end
[15:29] <acrimo> then the splash screen goes a sort of blue colour for a split second
[15:29] <acrimo> then i see a blinking cursor at the top left of the screen
[15:29] <acrimo> then the cd-drive spins up
[15:30] <acrimo> then the screen is blank
[15:30] <Docfxit> jrib <unconvertable> Maybe when I select the computer name which is docfxit it isn't pointing to the root?
[15:30] <Mushrooms> prince_jammys: Sorry I need to ask you another question again, I have tried to call up different programs using the terminal, namely gedit, firefox. I notice that if I open a separate terminal, and issue "killall gedit" it closes the connection between gedit and the terminal, as well as shutting down gedit. This is not true for firefox. Is this normal?
[15:30] <prince_jammys> Docfxit: jrib 's way is good, and alternative is "locate manager.*' which does NOT search the drive, it searches a previously made index of the drive (so it may not be fully updated),, locate is faster, but less accurate
[15:30] <test3r> tux: you want the extras. yes. plugins. =might as well get good bad ugly the crazy etc then u hav playback for a lot.
[15:30] <black_> I can't switch resolutions with xrandr
[15:30] <rever> bazhang, What is the best player to use for HD Content on Gutsy?
[15:30] <ubuntu-sw> hi i have a file file.zix how can i extract it
[15:30] <bazhang> rever I have had luck with vlc; opinions vary on that one
[15:30] <tux> thank test3r  & bazhang
[15:31] <bazhang> np
[15:31] <Docfxit> prince_jammys <unconvertable> Very nice to know about both ways. Tx.
[15:31] <bazhang> rever you may also want to visit www.medibuntu.org and get the win32codecs if you dont have them
[15:31] <test3r> er actually
[15:32] <test3r> !multimedia tux
[15:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about multimedia tux - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[15:32] <ubuntu-sw> hi i have a file file.zix how can i extract it
[15:32] <dgjones> ubuntu-sw, it doesn't look like you can do anything in ubuntu http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=432865, you might be able to get something running under wine though
[15:32] <test3r> !multimedia
[15:32] <ubotu> Ubuntu 7.04 installs multimedia codecs automatically. For older versions of Ubuntu, or if you can't use the automatic installer, see https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - For multimedia applications, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultimediaApplications
[15:32] <boris> hello
[15:32] <prince_jammys> Mushrooms: a little confused by the question --- but one thing : when you open a program from a terminal, that program is 'bound' to the terminal ... so if you then close the terminal, it will also close the program...  one way to invoke programs using commands and not have to keep a terminal open is with Ctrl-Alt-F2  try it ... i don't understand your original question
[15:33] <test3r> ;)
[15:33] <rever> bazhang, I have all the codecs and like I said the play OK just not as well as I thought. On my older system everything is smooth. CPU is low too. Here on the dual core I get 78% so thats one full core and haf of another
[15:33] <ubuntu-sw> so i can not extract .zix files on ubuntu
[15:34] <MasterMel> is there a standard password and username for samba?
[15:34] <bazhang> rever what driver you have for that video card?
[15:34] <jrib> !samba > mastermel (read the private message from ubotu)
[15:34] <rever> bazhang, The latest 169 buy Nvidia
[15:34] <bazhang> manually installed rever?
[15:35] <rever> bazhang, I used envy
[15:35] <acrimo> do i need to run anything after making a change to /etc/X11/xorg.conf for it to take effect?
[15:35] <bazhang> uh oh envy
[15:35] <Pici> acrimo: You need to restart xwindows.  Either by ctrl-alt-backspace or sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart
[15:35] <Mushrooms> prince_jammys: yeah i noticed that one single terminal handles one instance of gedit only.
[15:35] <Wirwing> I dont have direc rendering. Heres my xorg.conf http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55972/
[15:36] <rever> bazhang, I am thinking about recompiling mplayer with better options as I do not think it was compiled to play HD content.
[15:36] <Mushrooms> prince_jammys: don't worry about the question, now that i read it, it doesn't make sense to myself
[15:36] <prince_jammys> Mushrooms: another tip, since you are exploring the terminal is tab completion -- do you use it?
[15:37] <Mushrooms> prince_jammys: yep i know about tab completion, it's partially implemented in windows too
[15:37] <bazhang> rever you might also consider using the restricted driver manager to install the drivers--envy is not well considered here
[15:37] <prince_jammys> Mushrooms: ok -- in the terminal it will expand both known commands and file names
[15:37] <rever> bazhang, the restricted driver is outdated. I was going to do it manually but decided to use envy since it builds a deb package.
[15:38] <Lieuwe> hello
[15:38] <acrimo> Pici: would restarting the system do it?
[15:38] <prince_jammys> Mushrooms: handy when you have crap like Program\ Files/Adobe\ Photoshop and such
[15:38] <Pici> acrimo: sure.
[15:38] <Necrodrako> Hello, Im using Gutsy Gibbon, I have a "Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer 2.0"  which has side buttons primarily used for navigating back and forth in a browser. I cannot seem to get these buttons to function Ive tried several tutorials, to no avail. can anyone here help me?
[15:38] <Mushrooms> prince_jammys: yep i know what you mean. thanks for the tip :)
[15:39] <rever> bazhang, it worked and everything loads without issues and I configured xorg myself. So other than the envy created a deb package it is the same as running the nvidia installer itself. From what I can see
[15:39] <feysalus> hi

[15:41] <Seveas> too late Pici and Amaranth :)
[15:41] <Pici> :(

[15:44] <Seveas> prince_jammys, Mushrooms it's much simpler: /usr/bin/firefox is a shellscript setting up a proper environment for firefox. At the end it starts /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin, which is the actual browser

[16:12] <dgjones> !ask | whites
[16:12] <ubotu> whites: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)

[16:12] <frijolie> does anybody know, is HD-DVD playback software or hardware?

[16:13] <prince_jammys> NeXtDaY: ah i see
[16:13] <whites> i got gutsy and i have a creative soundblaster x-fi fatal1ty... but i don't know how to install it :P
[16:13] <bazhang> hardware but offtopic here frijolie
[16:13] <frijolie> i'm purchasing a Toshiba Laptop which has a HD-DVD combo drive (it is also a DVD+- writer)
[16:13] <NeXtDaY> bazhang: Yep. will do that soon. first i must get gusty livecd
[16:13] <prince_jammys> whites: sound card not detected?
[16:13] <whites> nope... in devices there are 0 soundcards
[16:13] <frijolie> buzhang: I don't care about playing HD-DVDs, i just want to make sure the drive will be recoginized and function as a regular DVD drive
[16:13] <NeXtDaY> bazhang: thanks for your help. hope to see u here soon :)
[16:13] <whites> but in pci devices there is creative x-fi
[16:14] <bazhang> frijolie: should do--though running a livecd would help if the store lets you ;]
[16:14] <bazhang> NeXtDaY: see you later ;]
[16:14] <prince_jammys> whites: have had this problem but dont remember solution, sorry
[16:14] <NeXtDaY> bye
[16:14] <neverblue> frijolie, so you possibly want to play an HD-DVD on your DVD player?
[16:15] <frijolie> bazhang: good idea, i'll see if they'll let me use a LiveCD...
[16:15] <frijolie> neverblue: well, it would be nice...but definately not a requirement. I could live without it
[16:16] <whites> prince_jammys thanks for reading it... if anyone knows how to install x-fi soundblaster fatal1ty on gutsy tell me how to :)

[16:18] <boris> Pici: camera, not webcam
[16:18] <Pici> genii: ah.
[16:18] <rvalles> networkmanager just doesn't work; wifi connects but only when I go to the config tool and edit (touching nothing) the wifi settings.

[16:18] <frijolie> genii: thanks, I'll check out that link
[16:19] <prince_jammys> thesaint4444: how are you going to run wine programs without a desktop environment?
[16:19] <rvalles> on boot, it does indeed launch wpa_supplicant, but doesn't connect anywhere (doesn't even set the essid)
[16:19] <boris> Pici: ive got Ixus 70 digital camera, maybe you could help me, ubuntu 7.10 cant detect it and i _need_ to get photos off it
[16:19] <frijolie> bazhang: your guess, it will still be recognized and work as a normal DVD player?
[16:19] <frijolie> bazhang: that's all I really care about.
[16:19] <thesaint4444> prince_jammys: it is a console program... does not need a window...
[16:20] <rvalles> how can I disable an interface from NetworkManager point of view, so that I can set up that one by hand?
[16:20] <prince_jammys> thesaint4444: i know, but the windows programs that it runs need windows
[16:20] <AJC_Z0> boris: Can you remove the storage device from it and put it in a reader?
[16:20] <bazhang> frijolie: I would read up on that a bit--I always do my homework when buying new hardware--usually asking someone in irc is my last step ;]
[16:20] <thesaint4444> prince_jammys: no... the windows program is a console program.
[16:20] <Jouva> I'm wondering if there's a PAM library (or other authentication software) that can use the 6 digit output from VeriSign "Identity Protection" key fobs in Ubuntu?
[16:20] <amenado> rvalles-> just go and modify /etc/network/interfaces
[16:21] <frijolie> bazhang: where do you suggest looking, I've already tried the forums (ubuntuforums.org)
[16:21] <adamb> Hey guys I am trying to get my dual monitors working, but it only displays on one, any idea on how i would go about getting this fixed?
[16:21] <prince_jammys> thesaint4444: you mean its DOS?
[16:21] <thesaint4444> prince_jammys: windows runs on top of dos...
[16:21] <bazhang> frijolie: something like computer name ubuntu gutsy hd-dvd support or along those lines for search terms in google
[16:21] <prince_jammys> thesaint4444: did you check whether wine can run in DOS mode? i thought it couldn't
[16:21] <rvalles> amenado: if an interface is set that way, networkmanager won't manage it?
[16:21] <whites> it's boring having gutsy without soundcard : <unconvertable> omg
[16:22] <boris> AJC_Z0: how ?
[16:22] <adamb> ctrl-atl-bkspace used to take me to console mode back in the day, how do I get to init 3 nowadays?
[16:22] <thesaint4444> prince_jammys: yes I believe it can.
[16:22] <amenado> rvalles nm uses same file /etc/network/interfaces
[16:22] <boris> AJC_Z0: you mean a SD card reader ? i dont have it
[16:22] <nano-> How do I enable wireless if I've been using the cable for a while? Pulling out the cable and disabling the kill-switch doesn't help.

[16:23] <rvalles> amenado: thing is, I want to hide wlan0 from nm, so that nm doesn't touch it ever
[16:23] <nano-> Not that this is Hardy, not Gutsy, so my own fault, but it's factory default Hardy so just pointing it out so that it will not be broken when Hardy arrives.

[16:24] <dr-raku> can anybody help me to fix hal-device-manager to get it running again? it gives some messages and dies ( http://pastebin.com/md66f4af ); i'm running gutsy and noticed this behaviour after today's autoupdate
[16:24] <amenado> SHARKattack-> intall the open ssh server
[16:24] <fatereconciled> Why remote into ubuntu?
[16:24] <rvalles> amenado: quite smart, but it's part of ubuntu's base stuff
[16:24] <rvalles> amenado: this is my sister computer, I can't go and break up the whole system to disable it
[16:24] <amenado> rvalles-> just because its there in the base, you dont have to use it, how often do you tinker with cron?
[16:24] <thesaint4444> prince_jammys: hey no problem, thanks...
[16:25] <rvalles> anyways, it seems you're right and it stores his stuff there, amenado
[16:25] <rvalles> but the wpa key, which isn't there; where is it?
[16:25] <amenado> rvalles how often do you tinker with syslogd ?
[16:25] <meekolope> hello all
[16:25] <Tankado> hello anyone know how i can install the eclipse-cdt plugin for ubuntu? is there a package or something?
[16:25] <adamb> How do I get from X windows to console mode (run level 3) ?
[16:25] <rvalles> amenado: I use gentoo at home
[16:25] <ikonia> Tankado: search synaptic to see if there is a package in the repo
[16:25] <amenado> rvalles-> wpa keys are also defined in same interfaces file
[16:25] <meekolope> adamb: init 3
[16:26] <rvalles> amenado: I got computers for my sisters as a present, this one needs wifi (router in another room, no cable)
[16:26] <Tankado> ikonia : i  tried i only see "eclipse" as a whole but not the cdt plugin
[16:26] <meekolope> adamb: as root
[16:26] <ikonia> adamb: ubuntu uses runlevel 2 by default
[16:26] <fatereconciled> I've had problems with using secure WPA with ubuntu
[16:26] <adamb> that does nothing
[16:26] <rvalles> amenado: it's not there.
[16:26] <ikonia> Tankado: what format file does the plugin come in
[16:26] <Pici> adamb: You want to stop xwindows temporarily?
[16:26] <rvalles> amenado: what's the syntax? then I'd try and add that by hand
[16:26] <adamb> init 3 doesn't do anything.
[16:26] <amenado> rvalles-> you have to add it in, it does not magically add the wpa keys
[16:26] <adamb> Pici: yes..
[16:26] <whites> anyone knows how to install x-fi soundblaster fatal1ty on gutsy?!
[16:26] <adamb> Where is the inittab?
[16:26] <Pici> adamb: sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop
[16:27] <amenado> rvalles i dont know on top of my head, but if you google for it am sure you'd find the correct one
[16:27] <dr-raku> whites, in.. /etc/ ??
[16:27] <Tankado> they offer to download it there : http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/downloads.php  but i heard its arealy long process and thought i could find something simpler
[16:27] <fatereconciled> Whites: Is your card blacklisted
[16:27] <amenado> rvalles some info we dont have readily available, so we google for it ourselves
[16:27] <ikonia> Tankado: doesn't look like there is anything in the repo for it
[16:27] <rvalles> amenado: networkmanager _knows_ the key... it does even work the moment I edit the essid (delete a char and put it back, then click okay)
[16:28] <dr-raku> rvalles, any ideea, please? :|
[16:28] <whites> dr-raku it is not detected
[16:28] <Tankado> ok thanks ikonia will just d/l it from there

[16:28] <amenado> rvalles i advised you already, you dont have to tinker with it if you have it set in the interfaces file
[16:28] <ikonia> js1: dpkg -i
[16:28] <frijolie> will Ubuntu ever allow package selection during install?
[16:28] <macogw> adamb: you can use update-rc.d to edit what starts or doesnt during different runlevels
[16:28] <fatereconciled> jsl: dpkg
[16:28] <macogw> adamb: its the debian version of chkconfig
[16:29] <fatereconciled> Or ikonia beat me to that :P

[16:35] <ikonia> Hisotaso: yes,
[16:36] <adamb> So I installed nvida driver with "envy" but it doesn't seem to see my secondary monitor, what else can i do?
[16:36] <whites> fatereconciled there are 64b drivers from creative but i don't know why the installation crash...
[16:36] <ikonia> !envy > adamb
[16:36] <neverblue> ikonia, i seena previous post for me, about a plugin, wrong person, correct?
[16:36] <js1> thx
[16:36] <Hisotaso> Ikonia i dont know where i can check that
[16:36] <ikonia> neverblue: spot on
[16:36] <adamb> ikonia: ?
[16:36] <[-Haza-]> Pici: Cheers mate :)
[16:36] <ikonia> Hisotaso: what version of ubuntu did you download 32bit / 64bit desktop / server
[16:36] <ikonia> adamb: check the pm from ubotu
[16:36] <Hisotaso> oph its 32
[16:36] <Hisotaso> sorry
[16:37] <fatereconciled> what do you mean upon loading driver on boot?
[16:37] <Hisotaso> ikonia it was working before but i saw womething online that said the generic kernel supported dual core
[16:37] <Hisotaso> so i wanted to try it
[16:37] <adamb> ikonia: yeah i tried the restricted drivers on and off, and still didn't see my second monitor
[16:37] <whites> fatereconciled are u talking to me? :P
[16:37] <adamb> what else could I try?
[16:37] <fatereconciled> yes =P
[16:37] <frijolie> prince_jammys: well, I definately don't want a server environment. I at least want GNOME installed
[16:37] <rvalles> amenado: gonna reboot now and hopefully will go up during boot
[16:37] <ikonia> Hisotaso: it does
[16:38] <whites> fatereconciled i got 2 soundcards... internal and this x-fi...  i can only load internal drivers from boot
[16:38] <bazhang> frijolie: prince_jammys was unaware of the other minimal install
[16:38] <ikonia> adamb: well, you've borked you ubuntu install as far as I'm concerned using envy
[16:38] <amenado> rvalles if you read up that article on how to wpa... and used  pre-up ...you'd be okay
[16:38] <adamb> I tried before using envy...
[16:38] <Hisotaso> ikonia ya i just tried to go back to the 386 kernel to get my video working, thought i could just choose to boot to it in grub and it would be back to normal
[16:38] <adamb> using restricted drivers
[16:38] <ikonia> adamb: so ?
[16:38] <frijolie> bazhang: oh, so there's minimal install 1 and minimal install 2? Hehe
[16:38] <ikonia> adamb: should have stuck with the drivers and made them work
[16:38] <fatereconciled> go into BIOS and disable both before installing asta
[16:39] <ikonia> adamb: envy is no the answer
[16:39] <Indiadev_Techie> Windows really Suckx !!!
[16:39] <prince_jammys> frijolie: right.  bazhang pointed out the other minimal install ... the server install doesnt even require that you install any server packages, but if you want a desktop you have to install it yourself
[16:39] <whites> fatereconciled they're both disabled
[16:39] <adamb> ikonia: ok i will revert back, but what should I do to make restricted drivers work?
[16:39] <ikonia> Indiadev_Techie: thats not appropriate here.
[16:39] <bazhang> frijolie: well one is the minimal desktop; the other is ubuntu-server and nothing you want as far as I can tell
[16:39] <ikonia> adamb: I'm not debugging an envy mess, I can't support you until you do a re-install on your machine
[16:39] <mjw-> !offtopic | Indiadev_Techie
[16:39] <ubotu> Indiadev_Techie: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[16:39] <fatereconciled> whites hmm.. and you're sure all alsa was loaded correctly
[16:39] <blue|palm> what does it mean when apt-get reports (after an upgrade command) that is has held certain packages back?
[16:39] <Indiadev_Techie> ikonia: but it really **** !!!
[16:39] <blue|palm> is there something that needs to be done to install these packages? Are there conflicts? etc
[16:39] <adamb> I will re-install, i am asking when i do re-installed what do I do to get second monitor.
[16:39] <ikonia> Indiadev_Techie: it doesn't matter. It's not appropriate or required here.
[16:40] <Indiadev_Techie> ikonia: i really hate it....
[16:40] <amenado> Blue-Omega-> if you use synaptic, it takes care of dependencies
[16:40] <frijolie> bazhang: isn't there a package called ubuntu-minimal or something similar?
[16:40] <blue|palm> amenado, ^ was that meant for me?
[16:40] <keoni> is there a way to make a hard drive image with dd without img the freespace of a disk?
[16:40] <Kouen> hi everyone
[16:40] <frijolie> Also, what is the current kernel out there?
[16:40] <Indiadev_Techie> ikonia: i have a old via p4 pc with 128mb ram nd 40gb harddrive....can i install ubuntu on it.....
[16:41] <amenado> yeah...change your nick so its easy to type
[16:41] <ikonia> Indiadev_Techie: I'm not interested, and it's not appropriate for this channel
[16:41] <fatereconciled> Not in all cases, amenado.
[16:41] <frijolie> or, how do you tell what kernel you're running. I know there's a command to tell
[16:41] <bazhang> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD frijolie
[16:41] <mahmoud2> indiadev_Techie: may be xubuntu
[16:41] <amenado> fatereconciled-> it will attempt and sometimes off course it  fails..nothing is 100% guaranteed
[16:41] <prince_jammys> frijolie: uname -a
[16:41] <Indiadev_Techie> ikonia: hey, i m askin ubuntu question.. u should help me...
[16:42] <orionjoe> can someone help me? I'm having trouble getting Open Arena to run
[16:42] <frijolie> bazhang: thanks
[16:42] <bazhang> Indiadev_Techie: #fluxbuntu
[16:42] <frijolie> prince_jammys: thanks
[16:42] <bazhang> np
[16:42] <AJC_Z0> boris: Yes, for example. I presume the camera has some unfortunate proprietary interface and doesn't just plug into a USB slot and appear as a mass storage device
[16:42] <nerdsquad3210> are you running open arena as root ?
[16:42] <Kouen> i has tried to install ubuntu linux but after 4 hours of waiting to the next dialog to be open (language selection was last one) i interrupted the installation via reset of the machine i want to know where ubuntu place files (temporal) i have three partition of fat32
[16:42] <amenado> Indiadev_Techie-> !attitude
[16:42] <Indiadev_Techie> i wanna try ubuntu on my old system toooo ....
[16:42] <ikonia> Indiadev_Techie: try it out then
[16:42] <ikonia> Indiadev_Techie: if it meets the minimum requirments, try it
[16:43] <orionjoe> I don't know, I downloaded it. when i run it the screen turns black then goes away.
[16:43] <ikonia> Indiadev_Techie: if it doesn't, it's up to you what you do
[16:43] <orionjoe> sorry, noob here
[16:43] <bazhang> Indiadev_Techie: get the livecd of fluxbuntu run it and if you like it install it
[16:43] <Indiadev_Techie> ikonia: but will it reun sucessfully... i have 128mb on my old pc...
[16:43] <prince_jammys> orionjoe: how much RAM in the old box?
[16:43] <prince_jammys> orionjoe: sorry, wrong nick
[16:43] <ikonia> Indiadev_Techie: if it meets the minimum requirments it will run, how well depends on your needs and usage
[16:43] <frijolie> bazhang: the minimal install is really "minimal" -- it's only 9MB!
[16:43] <orionjoe> that's ok, i was confused for a sec :P
[16:43] <VOYAGER> orionjoe,  lcd screen ?
[16:44] <amenado> Kouen-> just restart the install process, if you are really curious, boot on the liveCD and mount those partitions to check if any where stored
[16:44] <Indiadev_Techie> bazhang: i dont want any other os than ubuntu....
[16:44] <bazhang> hehe yes frijolie
[16:44] <orionjoe> on a laptop
[16:44] <Kibbles> I'm behind a gateway. How can I check my external IP?
[16:44] <alanbshepard70> The other day I installed nvidia drivers for my graphics card and now whenever I run updates or install a .deb package I get a system restart required notice. Why is this and can i keep it from happening?
[16:44] <Kouen> ok thanks
[16:44] <bazhang> Indiadev_Techie: you have asked and been answered this is not a chat channel
[16:44] <orionjoe> so yeah, lcd
[16:44] <amenado> Kibbles-> 62.90.99.15
[16:44] <Kibbles> lol amenado thanks
[16:45] <faris> hey all
[16:45] <nerdsquad3210> hey what are the the differences between installing from live cd oposed to regular install cd ?
[16:45] <fatereconciled> Why not, bazhang
[16:45] <ikonia> nerdsquad3210: the livecd is the regular install cd
[16:45] <bazhang> fatereconciled: why not what?
[16:45] <Kibbles> amenado: how'd you find that out though?
[16:45] <nerdsquad3210> its not
[16:45] <faris> does the live cd have compiz-fusion ?
[16:45] <ikonia> nerdsquad3210: it is
[16:45] <faris> the 700mb one
[16:45] <nerdsquad3210> your kidding
[16:45] <ikonia> nerdsquad3210: no
[16:46] <bazhang> faris very basic effects yes
[16:46] <ikonia> faris: should do, but I don't think running it from a livecd gives a good representation
[16:46] <amenado> Kibbles-> knowhow..learned it...google for tutorials on tcpip  :)
[16:46] <mjw-> !livecd | nerdsquad3210
[16:46] <orionjoe> so no one knows how to get open arena working?
[16:46] <frijolie> bazhang: I'm assuming that doesn't install xserver, right?
[16:46] <ubotu> nerdsquad3210: The Ubuntu Desktop CD is a "LiveCD" which can be run without altering existing files on your harddrive. Especially useful for testing your hardware's compatibility, it also includes an install option.
[16:46] <faris> no i dont want to run it from the live cd ,,its just for the download size
[16:46] <alanbshepard70> What's the terminal command to send data to a serial port on my computer?
[16:46] <nerdsquad3210> but theres the not live install cdrom
[16:46] <bazhang> frijolie: again no idea there sorry
[16:46] <fatereconciled> Frijolie: It does
[16:46] <sulan> Hi guys, tried enabling Composite Extension with fglrx (latest version) and running KDE 4 in Gutsy Gibbon made my keyboard not working - any ideas?
[16:46] <faris> i didnt know that
[16:47] <faris> and all of them have the compiz-fusion ready out of the box right ?
[16:47] <bazhang> nerdsquad3210: sounds like you got the alternate cd then
[16:47] <Pici> nerdsquad3210: Yes, the alternate CD.  Thats for installing on things that may not be compatible with the LiveCD (usually graphics cards).   No difference in what packages are installed though.
[16:47] <nerdsquad3210> ok
[16:47] <amenado> alanbshepard70-> man uucp,  cu is the command i think..thats goes ways back to your time..lol
[16:47] <frijolie> bazhang or fatereconciled ?
[16:47] <fatereconciled> faris: I had to install compiz manually
[16:47] <bazhang> faris basic stuff if your card supports it
[16:47] <HEP85> nerdsquad3210: it is called alternate install cd
[16:48] <alanbshepard70> amenado: thanks. lol.

[16:48] <bazhang> frijolie: haha
[16:48] <faris> yea it does tried it before on opensuse after a very long effort
[16:48] <bazhang> faris what card
[16:48] <nerdsquad3210> shouldn't it be called alternative install cd ?
[16:49] <faris> Geforce 6800GT
[16:49] <kitty_> hello all
[16:49] <credible> faris: the only thing you'll have to install is compizconfig-settings-manager
[16:49] <prince_jammys> nerdsquad3210: alternative installation cd
[16:49] <credible> the rest is provided
[16:49] <Pici> !alternate | nerdsquad3210
[16:49] <bazhang> faris nvidia are nice in ubuntu--that card should be fine
[16:49] <ubotu> nerdsquad3210: The Alternate CD is a classical text-mode installation CD. It supports a wider range of hardware than the !LiveCD.  It can also be used as an upgrade CD. - See also !minimal
[16:49] <faris> alright ,,thnx
[16:49] <bazhang> faris I have the 7300 and compiz rocks in it
[16:50] <kitty_> Is it possible to change kubuntu intu ubuntu once it is installed... without a command line?
[16:50] <mar77i> hi i've got a question: what option is there to be added to the first line in a shell script? like in "#!/bin/bash -P"... no idea what that means
[16:50] <nerdsquad3210> compix steals resources from games !
[16:50] <prince_jammys> kitty_: yes
[16:50] <bazhang> kitty_: install ubuntu-desktop from synaptic
[16:50] <Pici> kitty_: All you need to do is install the ubuntu_desktop package from your favorite package manager.
[16:50] <rocky> trying to configure bind9 on my gutsy gibbon server, i have my authoritative domains setup and working properly, but for some reason my dns server refuses to answer requests that are not authoritative, did i miss something somewhere?

[16:51] <kitty_> great, thank you :)
[16:51] <amenado> actually am curious now, using oem install from 7.10,  one can set a template install and how do one then uses oem logon to customize?
[16:51] <kitty_> May I ask another question?
[16:51] <kitty_> or do I have to buy beer first?
[16:51] <kitty_> :P
[16:51] <Pici> kitty_: As many as you want ;)
[16:51] <bazhang> or synaptic if you are a nut like me and use both ;]
[16:51] <ricky_clarkson> I am using Windows to get online because I don't know how to make mobile broadband work in Ubuntu.  Can I get to my Ubuntu installation using vmware from within Windows, so that it has an Internet connection?
[16:51] <mar77i> hi i've got a question: what option is there to be added to the first line in a shell script? like in "#!/bin/bash -P"... no idea what that means
[16:51] <bazhang> kitty_: no only the one per day please ;]
[16:51] <kitty_> I used Wubi to install Ubuntu, didnt work, then I tried Kubuntu, didnt work, I figured out it was a graphics driver issue
[16:52] <kitty_> I got in through teh command line
[16:52] <Masqy> Hi all, I'm getting confused with xrandr. I have a Lenovo N3000, and would like to use an external monitor...
[16:52] <amenado> ricky_clarkson-> care to ask #vmware channel for windows questions?
[16:52] <kitty_> and installed the vesa driver
[16:52] <ikonia> kitty_: wubi is not a supported install method or tool
[16:52] <mjw-> mar77i that first line basically is calling the "interpreter" for the script that follows...in your case, it's calling bash, which is the default shell for ubuntu
[16:52] <ricky_clarkson> amenado: Hokay.
[16:52] <frijolie> bazhang: i guess I'm just trying to avoid spending 45 min after a fresh install of the ubuntu-desktop, removing all the--what I call--crap packages "rhythmbox, EVOLUTION, xsane, gnome-pilot, bluetooth, orca, ubuntu branded OOo, etc..."
[16:52] <prince_jammys> mar77i you mean what is the -P
[16:52] <kitty_> yes, but its the only option for me at the moment, seeing as how I am studying abroad in Japan, and my cd drive is dead ;)
[16:52] <Pici> mar77i: its also sometimes called the 'shebang' or 'hashbang' line.
[16:53] <kitty_> I didnt want to risk anything that would require me to install anything with a cd... or mes with partitions
[16:53] <ikonia> kitty_: that doesn't change the fact it's not supported
[16:53] <kitty_> right, but I am past the wubi point, I am in kubuntu now
[16:53] <smacky_> what is a good program to convert a vob file
[16:53] <kitty_> so the questions arent regaurding wubi really
[16:53] <ikonia> kitty_: but what/how wubi installs
[16:53] <kitty_> I just wanted to ask about how to install the proper driver, sinc eI am using vesa now
[16:54] <ikonia> kitty_: I'm sure someone else may respond
[16:54] <kitty_> I have a mobility x700, and I just wanted to install the correct driver
[16:54] <smacky_> what is a good program to convert a vob file
[16:54] <VOYAGER> google is your friend
[16:55] <prince_jammys> mar77i the path after the first two characters #!(referrer to as a she-bang) tell your comp where to find the interpreter for what follows .. in the case of a shell script, its /bin/bash

[17:08] <mjw-> Zvezdichko you may need xgl server. Otherwise, try pasting the entire output of compiz --replace into a pastebin and someone may be able to help
[17:08] <HEP85> neiloo: a windows partition is there. but since there is no boot flag i guess it is no system partition
[17:08] <prince_jammys> neiloo: looks like you're gonna have to mess with grub
[17:08] <Indiadev_Techie> neiloo: do a fresh install now...
[17:09] <mjw-> zvezdichko xgl is not *always* required for compiz
[17:09] <neiloo> of windows or ubuntu Indiadev_Techie?
[17:09] <VOYAGER> windows always first
[17:09] <HEP85> neiloo: Where did you install windows? On the 250GB or the 300GB HD?

[17:11] <VOYAGER> isnt ntfs anymore
[17:11] <mjw-> neiloo was that second hard drive what you booted windows from or did you just put files on it?
[17:11] <prince_jammys> VOYAGER: it's there in the second drive, NTFS
[17:11] <Indiadev_Techie> neiloo: but be sute to assign different partition/drive other than windoes to ubuntu...

[17:20] <console_jockey> So, to simplify: what is the cli command equivelant to "Safely remove" hardware?  It's not umount /my/dev (I've tried that).  Any ideas?

[17:25] <Pici> Zombine: Some metacity themes might be able to do that, but you definitly don't have the same level of customization that you do with fluxbox.

[17:48] <wng-> Does anyone know how to mute the laptop speakers when headphones are plugged in?
[17:48] <mjw-> monzie actually just post your entire /etc/X11/xorg.conf to a pastebin
[17:48] <cox377> java and firefox anyone?
[17:48] <eyemean> hi i got slight problem, i installed new hard drive and windows and ubuntu 7.10 with grub
[17:48] <IdleOne> !java | cox377
[17:48] <ubotu> cox377: To install a Java runtime/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java6-jre from the !Multiverse repository (in !Backports for !Edgy)
[17:48] <brunner> I like how FloodBot2 immediately adds three more lines to the conversation when it detects a flood
[17:48] <hakon_> Pici: one sec
[17:48] <eyemean> but now wen i start up it says it cant find boot omething or other
[17:49] <eyemean> basically grub does not load up
[17:49] <Pici> brunner: it also mutes the person so you don't see the 150 other lines that they are trying to paste.
[17:49] <eyemean> so now i've had to use live cd
[17:49] <IdleOne> brunner, 3 lines from the bot is better then 200 from a troll
[17:49] <profoak> Can any one help me, I recently tried to install vmware and now it trys to install itself as an extra package whenever i try to install anything
[17:49] <Aphh> Heh, looks like I'm not the only one having grub problems today.
[17:49] <monzie> mjw-: http://pastebin.ca/904044
[17:49] <IdleOne> brunner, or a newbie who doesnt know about pastebin
[17:49] <Zombine> So... I see that people come here for help, but what are the people who know what they're doing doing here?  What incentive is there to stick around?
[17:49] <brunner> it could mute and notice or msg instead of talking to the channel
[17:49] <Cew27> hi does anyone here run awn
[17:49] <brunner> and the mute/unmute could be more spaced out
[17:50] <hakon_> Pici:  I have enabled universe if that is what youre going at
[17:50] <brunner> rather, there could be a longer delay for the unmute so it's not all together
[17:50] <Zombine> Not that I'm complaining, but it just surpises me.  Just a helpful spirit, or are y'all payed bt Cannonical?
[17:50] <IdleOne> brunner, good idea. talk to LjL about it . I believe he owns the floodbot's
[17:50] <HEP85> eyemean: the new drive might be now the first one. so the grub config is now wrong
[17:50] <eyemean> can some one please help me sort out grub, im really stuck and im new to linux
[17:50] <cox377> IdleOne: hey, thanks for the link.. I've looked at that page and can't work it out. I've installed 1.6 but for some reason firefox wont load java.. it states applet not intilized.. I've run the reconfigure
[17:50] <Cew27> prince_jammys: sorry to bother you again but do you run awn
[17:50] <foormea> prince_jammys : just tried a "mount --bind" and chown the new mount point but that won't do the trick... the owner just won't change from root..
[17:50] <prince_jammys> Cew27: no, i don't
[17:50] <cappiz> what is the module name for IA32 emulation called?
[17:50] <mjw-> monzie unfortunately i don't know much about the fglrx driver...someone might be able to help also if you paste the output of compiz --replace
[17:50] <HEP85> eyemean: can you access your hard disk from the livecd?
[17:51] <eyemean> hep85 my new drive is sata1 and my second drive is ide
[17:51] <Cew27> prince_jammys: oh ok
[17:51] <prince_jammys> foormea hold on - do you want to change the partition permissions or the permissions of individual files inside?
[17:51] <eyemean> hep85 will install ntfs first
[17:51] <foormea> prince_jammys individual files
[17:51] <arashOio> hi, gprted cannot located any file systems, I wanna retrieve my data in my hard drive...
[17:51] <brunner> IdleOne: Sorry, I'm just trying to disguise my cranky mood as being constructive, not trying to actually be helpful
[17:51] <hakon_> Pici: Did you die?
[17:52] <monzie> mjw-: http://pastebin.ca/904046
[17:52] <Aphh> Does anyone know a reason why a previously ext2 filesystem I copied 90 gigs worth of files on and had "du -sh" run successfully would become unmountable?
[17:52] <prince_jammys> foormea oh ok because i do know how to change the partition permissions
[17:52] <Pici> hakon_: not yet, just thinking.
[17:52] <danbhfive> !guidelines > Zombine I think this message somewhat answers your question
[17:52] <dar-soul> hey guyz
[17:52] <dar-soul> need some help please
[17:52] <IdleOne> brunner, lol and still you mannaged to be helpful
[17:52] <dar-soul> i cant get amork or streamtuner to play anything
[17:52] <foormea> prince_jammys well basically i'd need a unix permission-able ntfs partition :D but apparently that's just not possible
[17:52] <pike_> Aphh: fsck corrects it?
[17:52] <Aphh> Let me see.
[17:52] <Bodsda> dar-soul, why not? error messages?
[17:52] <dar-soul> I think I have installed all the reuired codecs!
[17:53] <brunner> you guys are way too nice/tolerant here... I miss the old #debian attitude, "OMG RTFM! RTFM!!"
[17:53] <mjw-> monzie  sudo apt-get install xgl-server
[17:53] <dar-soul> amaroke is giving me no demux plugin
[17:53] <HEP85> eyemean: The problem is that the system always boots from the first drive. so we must install grub onto the new drive
[17:53] <hakon_> Pici: I used to have the same problem in 6.06... Some guy in here told me to do something in terminal that enabled a lot of packages and fixed the problem
[17:53] <profoak> Can someone help me, vmware tries to install as an extra package whenever i try to install ANY program, it wont go away
[17:53] <Aphh> "Couldn't find ext2 superblock, trying backup blocks..." that doesn't look promising, heh.
[17:53] <mjw-> monzie then restart X (ctrl-alt-backspace - this will also close everything without saving) and try running compiz --replace again
[17:53] <Pici> hakon_: Did you try doing a sudo apt-get update and try again?
[17:54] <wng-> Does anyone know how to mute the laptop speakers when headphones are plugged in?
[17:54] <hakon_> Pici: no...
[17:54] <Pici> hakon_: I need to run off to a meeting now, so if that doesnt work, try asking the channel again.
[17:54] <Bodsda> dar-soul, i got that once,. closing amarok and reopening fixed it,.,.make sure you have all the gsrteamer plugins & codecs
[17:54] <dar-soul> strematune is runing xmms which gives an error and aske to cehck soundcard and if output plugin selected or any program that is blocking the sound
[17:54] <W8TAH> can someone please tell me -- is there a procedure for using multiple physical hard drives in ubuntu server, using LVM and if so - were can i find it
[17:54] <hakon_> Pici: ok
[17:54] <ubuntu_> hi
[17:54] <Bodsda> hi
[17:54] <eyemean> hep85 thats what i thought i did, but i guess not, haha, i can access my ntfs drives now
[17:55] <unperson> Hi.  I've been playing Enemy Territory on my Ubuntu Gusty machine, and now after I ran update the sound doesn't work (or rather, the old trick to make the sound work doesn't work).  Anyone know anything about this?
[17:55] <HEP85> eyemean: does grub show up and displays an error or does it not even appear?
=== aricz___ is now known as aricz_
[17:56] <eyemean> hep85 does not even apprear, it says it can boot and to please insert boot cd
[17:56] <eyemean> cant boot i mean hep85
[17:56] <dar-soul> Bodsda, can you tell me the codecs to install
[17:56] <dar-soul> ?
[17:56] <Bodsda> dar-soul, search synaptic for gstreamer
[17:56] <mjw-> monzie any luck?
[17:57] <Aphh> I wonder how long fsck takes on a 320 gig drive.

[17:58] <danbhfive> profoak: have you tried sudo apt-get remove vmware   ?  maybe that will do something
[17:58] <HEP85> eyemean: it would be good if you could post the output from sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda and sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb so I know your partition setup
[17:59] <proairgun> in
[17:59] <Bodsda> eyemean, type exactly this into a terminal               sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda and sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb
[18:00] <Bodsda> HEP85, sorry for intruding on your convo, but he said he was a noob so i thought i'd elaborate a bit more
[18:00] <eyemean> whre can paste the output again hep58
[18:00] <PythonMan_> I get an error a bit now and then saying "this or that program, couldn't open audio, please check so no other program is blocking your sound device.", how do I check that?
[18:00] <Bodsda> !paste | eyemean
[18:00] <ubotu> eyemean: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[18:00] <HEP85> eyemean: www.pastebin.com
[18:00] <unperson> Does Ubuntu still use esd at the sound server?
[18:01] <eyemean> cheers bodsda and hep58
[18:01] <Bodsda> PythonMan_, close all programs using sound

[18:01] <Arelis> Hi all. I have an ATI Radeon 9600 but performance in games is very low. I'm using the open-source radeon driver, but found out FGLRX may be causing a lot of instability issues. And I don't want that again. So how can i crank up the performance?
[18:01] <PythonMan_> Bodsda: Heh, but is there any related commands I should know?
[18:01] <mjw-> unperson my experience is that ALSA is now preferred
[18:01] <eyemean> http://pastebin.com/d5b9532fc hep58
[18:01] <eyemean> http://pastebin.com/d5b9532fc hep85
[18:02] <Bodsda> PythonMan_, i havent been following your problem,. but i remember something called hardwaremixing or audiomixing,.,.ask the channel about them,.,.it allows you to have more than 1 proram using the soundcard at the same time
[18:02] <adamb> Ok so I am using the restricted driver for my video card which has two monitor attached, only one monitor displays when I use restricted, when i dont I can see both monitor, but identical. not an extended.
[18:02] <HEP85> eyemean: now type sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt
[18:02] <unperson> mjw-, Hmm...I thought alsa was a driver architecture not a sound server, but I don't know much about this stuff.
[18:02] <adamb> Anyone point me in right direction of getting my second monitor working?
[18:02] <mjw-> unperson neither do i :)
[18:02] <pike_> Arelis: im not sure about the 9600. ive heard the around 9200 is very good with the open source drivers but..ebay may be your best option

[18:03] <Arelis> pike_, if i will need to buy a new video card, i'd buy a new computer anyways. But i don't have the money for that.
[18:03] <Bodsda> adamb, try asking in #compiz-fuision they'll probably know   (the last post was an arrow--pointing you--)
[18:03] <HEP85> eyemean: and then sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda
[18:04] <adamb> 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Unknown device 042f (rev a1)
[18:04] <pike_> Arelis: an old nvidia would be like 10-15 bucks but i get your point
[18:04] <VeganZombie> is there anyway to tell if I have a port open and forwarded to my computer? I can't seem to connect to a certain port from my public IP address but can on my local network.
[18:05] <MasterShrak> vegan netstat should help ya
[18:05] <HEP85> eyemean: and to be on the safe side we will install grub also on the second disk: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdb
[18:05] <mjw-> adamb: weird that it says unknown device, but this might help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaMultiMonitors
[18:05] <kikr> has anyone else noticed the problems with popups?
[18:05] <prince_jammys> VeganZombie: not sure but ports you're listening at:    netstat -a | grep LISTEN
[18:06] <bertvdp> hi, I'm using one of my PCs as a network file server, now I use FTP and SSH for filesharing at the moment but I would like to make it work better with mac and windows (and perhaps linux too), should I use smb, afl or nfs then ?
[18:06] <MasterShrak> kikr: in firefox im assuming?
[18:06] <VeganZombie> problem is the port I want to connect too is listening, but I can't connect to it.
[18:06] <kikr> MasterShrak, yeah
[18:06] <MasterShrak> bertvdp: samba
[18:06] <MasterShrak> kikr: i would install the adblock extension
[18:06] <bertvdp> MasterShrak, does mac work with samba too ?
[18:06] <eyemean> http://pastebin.com/d39c163e2 hep85
[18:06] <Arelis> pike_, what are the other options?
[18:07] <kikr> MasterShrak, i'm talking about the legit popups.
[18:07] <genii> adamb: 042f =Quadro NVS 290
[18:07] <MasterShrak> bertvdp: i believe so, you may need to install an extra piece of software on the mac client, but im not 100%
[18:07] <Cubitus> hi @ all.
[18:07] <Zvezdichko> is there software to capture my linux desktop on video?
[18:07] <adamb> gemi: yes thats what card I have
[18:07] <bertvdp> MasterShrak: and running samba and AFP or NFS at the same time, how would that go ?
[18:07] <MasterShrak> bertvdp: nvm, its looking like mac has a samba client built in
[18:07] <arcad3> sudo apt-get install recordmydesktop
[18:08] <HEP85> eyemean: last line should have been: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/hdb
[18:08] <adamb> i onyl see Screen 0, not a Screen 0 and 1, so its not detecting other monitor?  this is in nvidia-settings
[18:08] <Zvezdichko> thank you arcad3
[18:08] <prince_jammys> Zvezdichko: recordmydesktop
[18:08] <arcad3> np
[18:08] <MasterShrak> bertvdp: i dont know what afp is, but i dont think running samba and nfs will cause problems
[18:08] <eyemean> ok hep85 so i just do sudo grub-install now?
[18:08] <HEP85> eyemean: yes only with hdb instead at the end
[18:09] <bertvdp> MasterShrak, AFP is apple file protocol (which has been reverse engineerd to work for linux)
[18:09] <MasterShrak> adamb: is there a button that says "Detect Displays" ?
[18:09] <eyemean> ok hep85
[18:09] <mark4> ok so how do i start compiz-fusion in this fresh ubuntu install i got here. i tried compiz --replace ccp & but it didnt work
[18:09] <MasterShrak> bertvdp: ic, well i would just run samba, itll eb able to talk to windows and mac, no need for nfs or afp
[18:09] <HEP85> eyemean: after that grub should at least show up. maybe we still have the wrong partition order
[18:09] <Cubitus> now i have a toshiba satellite notebook with a intel graphic chip. sometimes, ubuntu freezes and I have to hard-reset my notebook. My question is: why is the intel graphic chip /gm965 / gl960 on the compiz blacklist? does intel not work on these drivers?
[18:09] <bertvdp> MasterShrak, okey thanks, I'll get some info from !samba then :P
[18:09] <bertvdp> !samba
[18:09] <ubotu> Samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT.

[18:12] <macogw> oiZo: when you drag a directory from the main part into the left part of Nautilus (the file browser) it automatically gets added to the Places Menu
[18:13] <MasterShrak> oiZo: also if you add things as a bookmark from nautilus, if i remember correctly (not a gnome user)
[18:13] <oiZo> well can i remove e.g. the Connect to server menu?

[18:16] <penyaskito> MasterShrak: the problem is that the cd sees the two disks, not the raid itself
[18:16] <jappdev> kashogi: are you verifing users based on their local account?
[18:16] <bertvdp> kashogi, what's your exact problem

[18:19] <ubotu> denzOw-norge: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

[18:23] <mjw-> !justask | mikebot
[18:23] <ubotu> mikebot: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
[18:23] <MasterShrak> penyaskito: well, i would consult the forums or google

[18:24] <adamb> Is there a way i can have wallpaper on my main monitor that doesn't span across both monitors?

[18:24] <bofh80> hey people, my bro's machine has ubuntu 7.10 has crashed. on boot it kernel panics right after "starting up . . . . ." saying something like 'cannot mount root fs hd(0,0)' or something really similar. i have booted of ubuntu cd and i can't mount and read the drive fine, is there a tool i can use to repair to boot error, or shall i just backup and reinstall?
[18:25] <kashogi> \i have set up ftp server  on ubuntu ,i can login with admin account but wheni add a user to ftp the password doesnot work
[18:25] <HEP85> eyemean: change the line # groot=(hd1,4) to # groot=(hd1,2) and save
[18:25] <bertvdp> adamb, I don't know, I use a special background or 2 pasted next to eachother ;)
[18:25] <profoak> How do you relink something to command, im getting a error and it says relink libpcrecpp.la with the above command, i don't know what its talking about
[18:25] <adamb> pike: well yeah, that would work possibly.. I just want a normal size wallpaper on my main monitor..
[18:25] <mikebot> I guess it would be gnome, not ubuntu.
[18:25] <adamb> bertvdp: : hahah
[18:25] <bofh80> ehm, rather "i CAN mount the drive and read write to it fine..."
[18:25] <baseline> hi, how can i see who is on my apache?

[18:28] <eyemean> http://pastebin.com/d5f3747f5 hep85
[18:28] <danbhfive> penyaskito: so I take it is an environmental variable, that sucks, at least for me
[18:28] <jappdev> eyeman: yes, in 2.6.24.2 its fixed
[18:28] <mjw-> MasterShrak i would assume that's what that update was for

[18:30] <Mud> I have several questions
[18:30] <jappdev> vegeta: try ntop
[18:30] <bofh80> MasterShrak, i can mount the drive fine, nothing wrong with it apparently, i'm hoping just some corruption in the boot strapping
[18:30] <danbhfive> penyaskito: ok, thanks
[18:30] <penyaskito> !asktoask | Mud
[18:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about asktoask - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi

[18:31] <penyaskito> !ask |Mud
[18:31] <ubotu> Mud: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
[18:31] <bofh80> MasterShrak, is it grub? can i repair the boot sector from the CD ? as that's the only thing i can't think of doing before i backup and just reinstall
[18:31] <denzOw-norge> one more question, How can i force ubuntu to go 100hz on the monitor?..i had 100hz in win XP..
[18:31] <Mud> !ask
[18:31] <Mud> ?
[18:31] <MasterShrak> bofh80: i would follow the guide for getting grub back after installing windows, althought thats not your problem, its pretty much the same process
[18:31] <MasterShrak> !grub | bofh80
[18:31] <ubotu> bofh80: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto

[18:33] <macogw> quittt: Lynx is all-text, Links2 can be used in just a terminal (not gnome-terminal) with framebuffer to show images and colors as well.  For normal ones, Dillo is very lightweight, but it doesn't have a great rendering engine.  Epiphany and Kazehakase are also a bit lighter than Firefox.
[18:33] <quittt> Dillo?
[18:33] <quittt> never heard of it
[18:33] <macogw> quittt: i only know of it because it's in Damn Small Linux
