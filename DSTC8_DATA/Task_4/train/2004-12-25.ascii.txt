[09:14] <crimsun> kleedrac: I'm afraid not. Any version of mplayer except for -k7* should work for your cpu
[09:14] <intinig> does a subversion gnome client exist?
[09:14] <kleedrac> crimsun: Hmmm ... I wonder why it does that?
[09:15] <will> best media player: VLC /get wxvlc) It plays everything!
[09:15] <|QuaD-> will: totem has caused me no troubles
[09:15] <|QuaD-> totem xine
[09:15] <crimsun> kleedrac: good question.
[09:15] <Tsjoklate> |QuaD same here.. totem-xine werkt geweldig
[09:15] <crimsun> intinig: I don't see one in warty or hoary
[09:15] <kleedrac> xine is working great for video and xmms works great for mp3's but some of my music is in .wma as my wife ripped it
=== L0sT [~waa3@raptor.ukc.ac.uk]  has joined #ubuntu
[09:16] <will> xine is very good, with w32codecs
[09:16] <|QuaD-> kleedrac: heh.. never needed a wma file played
[09:16] <crimsun> intinig: however, there's always gsvn, as in http://gsvn.tigris.org/
[09:16] <will> but post processing with VLC is the way forward, it uses its own codecs (builtin)
[09:16] <kleedrac> Quad: consider yourself lucky :) worse quality than mp3 ... wish she'd learn to use oggenc that's why I installed it :)
[09:17] <crimsun> intinig: that project, however, seems deprecated.
[09:17] <intinig> what should I use then?
[09:17] <|QuaD-> kleedrac: is ogg open source?
[09:17] <kleedrac> Quad: absolutely

[09:32] <|QuaD-> ironwolf: that seems like something i owuld go to #gaim for
[09:33] <|QuaD-> i don't believe we have any gaim developers here
[09:33] <Tsjoklate> |QuaD would go to their website and see if anyone else has the same problems
[09:33] <ironwolf> |QuaD: been there...since it's running under ubuntu, was hoping for help here...No response there.
[09:34] <kleedrac> crimsun: file sending
[09:34] <|QuaD-> Tsjoklate: i would?

[09:43] <crimsun> kleedrac: ah, but you installed "mplayer-custom", which the wiki says will not work.
[09:44] <kleedrac> Oh?  I didn't even realize!  How do I correct this?
[09:44] <crimsun> kleedrac: remove mplayer-custom and install mplayer-586 instead
[09:45] <crimsun> kleedrac: the reason for the illegal instruction is quite simple: mplayer-custom is compiled with SSE2 support, which your Pentium III does not support
[09:45] <crimsun> kleedrac: your Pentium III (like mine) only supports MMX, MMX2, and SSE

[10:23] <|QuaD-> Rattboi: are you talkign about it not starting x cuz of kde/gnome conflict?
[10:23] <wood1> There is bound to be 1 or more problems
[10:24] <|QuaD-> wood1: he didn't
[10:24] <|QuaD-> Tsjoklate: there is one girl that caught my eye!
[10:24] <Rattboi> |QuaD-: I'm talking about the new X menu update that changed the Gnome menus to Debian style
[10:24] <Rattboi> has that been fixed yet?
[10:24] <Tsjoklate> |QuaD the cook at the cafeteria at school?
[10:24] <|QuaD-> no.. .from the deb woman's page, not telling which though
[10:24] <|QuaD-> Rattboi: no idea, haven't updated
[10:24] <Tsjoklate> I know which one
[10:24] <wood1> Well Rattboi, I think that you have messed up your sources.list
[10:24] <|QuaD-> which
[10:25] <Rattboi> wood1: I'm running hoary
[10:25] <Rattboi> so it's to be expected
[10:25] <|QuaD-> wood1: he knows what he's doing
[10:25] <Tsjoklate> Erinn
[10:25] <wood1> So how active is the Debian Women community ?
[10:26] <Rattboi> ok, I guess I'll have to reboot and update
[10:26] <|QuaD-> Tsjoklate: that was actually #2
[10:26] <Simira> we're working on it. There was a BOF in Mataro on friday, and my article will be out today.
[10:26] <Tsjoklate> well then the bottom but really debian-women is not a meatmarket
[10:26] <|QuaD-> Tsjoklate: yeah :)
=== Tsjoklate changes subject
[10:26] <|QuaD-> Tsjoklate: it was a joke
[10:26] <|QuaD-> i am not going!
[10:26] <|QuaD-> i just looked at the picture
[10:26] <wood1> How many active members does it have ?
[10:27] <Simira> there are presentations on DW from time to time, on different places
[10:27] <wood1> Simira
[10:27] <Tsjoklate> |QuaD that's why I only post pictures of Bucky the squirel
[10:27] <|QuaD-> Tsjoklate: haha.... i am a normal 21 year old hornball
[10:27] <wood1> What is the actual goal of the community ?
[10:27] <Simira> wood1: I don't know. That depends on how you count. There's a mailing list, IRC-channel (open to men as well: #debian-women

[10:29] <|QuaD-> Tsjoklate: at least i am honest
[10:29] <Tsjoklate> |QuaD and I applaud you for such
[10:29] <wood1> So the last meeting was on the 20 of November? When will the next meeting be ?
[10:29] <Simira> wood1: what about taking a look at the web-page?
[10:30] <|QuaD-> (though if either erin or hannah live by me.... i wouldn't mind having dinner to talk about debian, lol)
[10:30] <wood1> Well I am looking at it
[10:31] <wood1> Simira, Are you a software developer ?
[10:32] <Simira> wood1: I wouldn't say that. I've made a couple of applications (for windows, though), but I'm more of a network maintainer and administrator

[10:38] <rattboi24> yeah, I guess I might have
[10:38] <rattboi24> I think one of the updates had an updated kernel

[10:51] <bluewheel> aboutToUbuntu, sudo apt-get update first
[10:51] <aboutToUbuntu> by the way, thanks for answering my questions, its very much appreciated
[10:51] <bluewheel> that will update the package listing
[10:51] <aboutToUbuntu> bluewheel, i did that
[10:51] <|QuaD-> aboutToUbuntu: hoary or warty
[10:52] <aboutToUbuntu> warty
[10:52] <|QuaD-> thats expected... it is stable
[10:52] <|QuaD-> not bleeding edge
[10:52] <aboutToUbuntu> so ... if i wanted, say, openoffice 1.1.3, I have to wait?
[10:53] <aboutToUbuntu> or vnc 4.x
[10:53] <rattboi24> or install it by hand
[10:53] <|QuaD-> there is a backports repository... but it might break your system
[10:53] <tranceConscious> how do i set up a usb modem???
[10:54] <aboutToUbuntu> so, as far as I can remember, openoffice has a very nice and easy installed, or at least it was with suse. will it do the same thing here, and will it mess with the rest of my system?
[10:54] <aboutToUbuntu> *installer
[10:55] <|QuaD-> aboutToUbuntu: i owuld reccomend the back ports repo... but thats jsut me
[10:55] <rattboi24> nice, ubuntuguide.org
[10:55] <rattboi24> that's easier to remember
[10:55] <aboutToUbuntu> QuaD, how do i do it?
[10:56] <|QuaD-> rattboi24: is that the link for backports?
[10:57] <jiyuu0> |QuaD-, http://ubuntu-bp.sourceforge.net/
[10:57] <ironwolf> does order matter for rsync  --include and --exclude's ?
[10:57] <|QuaD-> aboutToUbuntu: look at jiyuu0's link
[10:58] <rattboi24> |QuaD-: no, unofficial ubuntu guide
[10:58] <rattboi24> used to be a different link that was more convoluted
[10:58] <wood1> But OpenOffice lacks the power of MS_Access

[11:01] <wood1> I want OpenOffice to include a Database Software like Access
[11:01] <housetier> wait for the next major release
[11:02] <wood1> Well OpenOffice is nice but still lacks behind MS-Office in database application
[11:02] <housetier> or get the beta preview
[11:02] <wood1> How do I get the preview
[11:02] <housetier> openoffice.org I'd say
[11:02] <wood1> Can it handle Access mdb files ???
[11:02] <|QuaD-> wood1: how do you figure?
[11:02] <|QuaD-> MS Access is horrible
[11:03] <housetier> wood1 I don't know, see for yourself :)
[11:03] <|QuaD-> ms shouldn't even include it in their suite... there is nothing good about it anymore
[11:03] <wood1> Well it is very good
=== Simira likes Access
[11:03] <|QuaD-> the one advantage it had was ease of use

[11:03] <wood1> Come on, let's be fair, Access is well ahead in terms of Database
[11:03] <|QuaD-> and it is horrible in terms of performance
[11:04] <|QuaD-> wood1: how do you figure? is isn't multithreaded, no server archetecture... what is it ahead on????
[11:04] <wood1> Well if all you want is a database software to handle 2 million records, Access is faster than the wind
[11:05] <|QuaD-> wood1: i REALLY hope you are kidding.... access is slow
[11:05] <|QuaD-> want me to get you technical papers comparing that to others>
[11:05] <JanC> OOo can handle .mdb on platforms that support the MS Jet Database Engine...
[11:05] <|QuaD-> wood1: if access is so powerful, why is it soo cheap and microsoft sql server like a couple grand?
[11:06] <wood1> Well have you done that ?
[11:06] <wood1> Can you get OpenOffice to handle *.mdb files
[11:06] <JanC> and Access is not a database, it's a database frontend & a RAD tool
[11:07] <JanC> which by default uses the MS Jet Database Engine...

[11:10] <|QuaD-> wood1: what would
[11:10] <sladen> oscarh: what patch?
[11:10] <wood1> If I could use some simple interface to interact with MySQL databases ?
[11:10] <oscarh> sladen,  alps touchpad
[11:10] <JanC> wood1: OOo 2.0 will have database form creation wizards etc.
[11:11] <wood1> So QuaD, how do I do that in MySQL
[11:11] <Simira> and Access hasn't?
[11:11] <|QuaD-> woood1: mysqlcc, phpMyAdmin
[11:11] <wood1> By the way, I have to get my job done in Access in 1 Week.
[11:12] <wood1> When will OpenOffice 2 get released ?

[11:13] <bluewheel> wood1, I did plenty of Access work, what got you stuck ? i have not sued it in a while now in favor of SQL for a varity of reasons
[11:14] <Simira> isn't OOo actually a MS Office clone?
[11:14] <JanC> not really
[11:14] <|QuaD-> wood1: if you are new.... then why did you make comments how access is so superior
[11:14] <JanC> first versions of StarWriter date back to the 1980s  :)
[11:14] <bluewheel> Simira, OOo is opene source version of StarOffice
[11:14] <wood1> Well bluewheel, I have a Access Database which contains 20 fields
[11:14] <|QuaD-> Simira, bluewheel: sql is a language not a database... you use sql within access and mysql
[11:14] <wood1> It's has just 1 primary key
[11:15] <bluewheel> 1 primary key ouch
[11:15] <wood1> It has 10 tables which has relationships with the Master table
=== pitti [~pitti@213.151.107.243]  has joined #ubuntu
[11:16] <wood1> QuaD, I said that I need an esay interface like Access. I will spend about 6 months to devote my time to master the SQL language but for now, I have to stick to Access
[11:16] <wood1> The only reason I have to switch to Windows is only because of Access
[11:16] <wood1> Don't you get it ???
[11:16] <bluewheel> Simira, i didn't know access used sql ?
[11:17] <bob2> access is based on Jet, which is somewhat like sqlite
[11:17] <Simira> why does on e have to excuse oneself for using Windows? *switches between mIRC and OE
[11:17] <Simira> bluewheel: yes
[11:17] <bob2> Simira: traitor!
[11:17] <tsw> if I recall correctly access uses something like sql but no quite alike
[11:18] <bluewheel> Simira, you don't / should not have to, but many people in this room might beg to differ, personally i spend 50% of my time on a Mac
[11:18] <tranceConscious> microsoft uses jet engine...
[11:18] <wood1> So can somebody help me if I can somehow use some kind of application in Linux to import my Access Database
[11:18] <tranceConscious> I mean access uses that.
=== Simira does *not* apology for using Windows
=== svenl_ is now known as svenl
[11:19] <bob2> wood1: I really doubt anything can do that
[11:19] <wood1> The Access database has 1 Primary key with 20 fields and has 10 separate tables which has relationships with the master table
[11:19] <JanC> wood1: you can learn basic SQL in 2 hours...
=== tsw has also windows now, for drawing few elctronic schematics
[11:19] <JanC> maybe one
[11:20] <bob2> wood1: if you can dump the sql, you might be able to munge it into a linux rdbms, but this is an access question, not an ubuntu one
[11:20] <housetier> wood1 maybe you can dump the database and import it into mysql
[11:20] <wood1> Well is there a way to import the Access Database to MySQL ?
[11:20] <JanC> yes
[11:20] <wood1> Wow that's great
[11:20] <bob2> wood1: you'll need to go ask some forum where questions about Access are on-topic
[11:21] <wood1> How do I go about doing that ?
[11:21] <bob2> wood1: #windows, perhaps
[11:21] <Simira> wood1: try google...
[11:21] <JanC> in your "Access database" make a foreign tables that link to a MySQL tables
[11:21] <|QuaD-> wood1: 05:04 < wood1> Well if all you want is a database software to handle 2 million records, Access is faster than the wind,  05:03 < wood1> Come on, let's be fair, Access is well ahead in terms of Database, i don't think you should just install windows and use their propietary stuff
[11:21] <JanC> and then just copy everything   :-p
[11:22] <JanC> foreign tables (or wather it's called is under import or link or something like that IIRC
[11:22] <wood1> The main point that I was and am trying to get is getting MySQL to import the Access database and use some kind of simple applications to edit the values

[00:07] <qazwer> thanks
[00:07] <linux_galore> seen a few people ask about Ubuntu as a server......time to make a server release
[00:07] <|QuaD-> qazwer: i actually think the developers reccomend against ubuntu for servers
[00:08] <daniels> |QuaD|: no, we absolutely do not
[00:08] <daniels> linux_galore: why would we want a separate 'server release'?
[00:08] <daniels> we use ubuntu on all our servers and see no reason for anyone else not to
[00:09] <daniels> boot with 'linux custom' in the installer and you won't get gnome or anything
[00:09] <linux_galore> daniels: why not..... if people want to pay for it
[00:09] <cenerentola> linux_galore free as in freedom and free as in beer
[00:09] <linux_galore> who needs a desktop with a server all you need is a nice admin interface vie the LAN

[00:14] <womble> Is there a dockable dialup management thing for Warty that I can give to ordinary users to control their PPP connection?
[00:15] <linux_galore> bluewheel: yes and there are now companies that make server releases to match the desktop releases......you know its like saying ooh you can buy a family car but we dont do anything but family cars.......your dead in the water
[00:15] <daniels> you don't need separate server and desktop releases

[00:16] <qazwer> yes, I don't think  separate server and desktop releases
[00:16] <bluewheel> see i've only run Linux on my home machines and my work desktop, I managed to get one work server to used Linux for a file server because win2k crashed too much and they were pull out hair
[00:16] <arctick> i dont think that analogy works with OOS
[00:16] <linux_galore> I know so have a desktop server selector in the install under expert
[00:16] <arctick> oss rather
[00:17] <linux_galore> I cant see a distro doing a good desktop and server from a single CD
[00:17] <arctick> there are lots of custom-target distros that do quite well, look at knoppix
[00:18] <linux_galore> yes but say Im a corp with $$$ and Im like OK nice desktop but do you have a server option.......ooh use the same CD....eeer yeah right......Hello Mr Novell do you have a server to go with your desktop

[00:19] <Kamion> FYI, I renamed the 'custom' option to 'server' earlier today to drive home the point that it's perfectly reasonable to use Ubuntu as a server
=== Nominus [~hanzo@ppp83-237-39-72.pppoe.mtu-net.ru]  has joined #ubuntu
[00:19] <qazwer> guangdong
[00:20] <bluewheel> qazwer, ahh ok have a friend in Bejing at the moment
[00:20] <linux_galore> Kamion: yeah but your not going to have apache mysql and php and a few mail server options squished into that single CD
[00:21] <qazwer> hehe,3q,but how to only to say you?
[00:21] <bluewheel> I think there is a need for server / desktop products to be differant, if for no other reason than we accept more failure on our desktop
[00:22] <bluewheel> a server though needs a seperate toobox to interface with since it is locked away somewhere deep in the depths
[00:22] <linux_galore> yes and the server rig can be a good money earner
[00:22] <Kamion> linux_galore: sure, but that's ok, you can get them from the network totally trivially. people installing servers will be picking their own package sets anyway.
[00:23] <daniels> if GNOME crashes, that has no effect on your web server
[00:23] <bluewheel> linux_galore, and there is that, I mean people don't mind paying for a server OS and if it undercuts windows then it is very viable option for TCO
[00:23] <daniels> there's no reason to say 'let's make something stable for our servers and it's OK, our desktops can be complete crap'
[00:23] <linux_galore> Kamion: I can do that with Novell too but II dont get the Enterprise server rig for that reason i get it because everything on the CD works together very well
[00:24] <bluewheel> daniels, but people accept it, it does not mean they will look at deiban stable, it has a very good version of gnome
[00:24] <Kamion> everything in Ubuntu main should work together just as well as everything on the CD
[00:24] <bluewheel> as in it's stable as hell
[00:24] <__learner__> where is the folder where the page should be in apache for linux? How can I change that?
[00:25] <arctick> i cant see Ubuntu or Debian taking any market share away from rh or novell anytime soon... the thing is people want proven stable packages
[00:25] <linux_galore> Kamion:  I dont want a desktop Ive already done that....now I want a dedicated server solution
[00:25] <arctick> plus a big name
[00:25] <Kamion> linux_galore: I wasn't contradicting that in the slightest
[00:25] <bluewheel> arctick, yea and peope also want to pay for software that comes from a nice big company who will certify and support it
[00:25] <bob2> __learner__: /var/www/
[00:25] <__learner__> tx a lot
[00:25] <linux_galore> Kamion: as soon as the customer install either red hat or Novell guess whats happens........both of those companies will throw in a 12 month desktop install for free....bye bye Ubuntu
[00:26] <Kamion> the guy who runs all our servers doesn't want his distribution to pick the set of packages though; he wants to select them by hand and have them be the minimal possible selection to reduce security exposure
[00:26] <Kamion> linux_galore: our releases are all supported for 18 months and we'll be doing longer-term support options too.
[00:26] <qazwer> if I set LC_ALL=zh_CN,I want save filename by zh_CN not UTF8, how can i do it?
[00:26] <arctick> wow, sounds like you got an admin that cares
[00:26] <linux_galore> Kamion: you can do that with any distro.....you miss the logic of having a distro
[00:26] <daniels> arctick: well, we didn't just hire random people
[00:26] <Kamion> linux_galore: as a distribution developer, I respectfully disagree :-)

[00:27] <daniels> linux_galore: as far as I can tell, your main complaint about Ubuntu is that it's free
[00:27] <linux_galore> Kamion: using your logic I may aswell go grab Debian because im getting the same thing anyway
[00:27] <Kamion> distributions are about large-scale software integration and support; they aren't just about picking package sets for you 'cos you don't want to bother managing your server
[00:28] <Kamion> linux_galore: you don't get security support over three release cycles with Debian
[00:28] <bluewheel> daniels, it's more than just free, it just works
[00:28] <daniels> linux_galore: er, no, Ubuntu and Debian are different distributions, with different installers, packages, hardware support, and package sets
[00:28] <linux_galore> daniels: no Im saying Ubuntu needs to go beyond the desktop
[00:28] <bluewheel> debian / gentoo / freebsd are just free

[00:29] <arctick> ive got a server related question. when youve set up apache, where do you stick your websites?
[00:29] <linux_galore> nope single CD desktop for a server......sorry no go and Im not sitting around while I have to download a pile of packages missing on the Ubuntu "desktop" CD for a server
[00:29] <arctick> im going to try to learn php+sql
[00:30] <Kamion> if you're managing a reasonable number of servers then you'll have a local mirror anyway
[00:30] <Kamion> that's what all the server admins I know do
[00:30] <Kamion> since you don't want to download all the security updates a dozen times
[00:30] <bob2> linux_galore: so you'd be happy if someone generated cd images without gnome but with dovecot?
[00:31] <linux_galore> yes I just grab a server enterprise CD shove it in one machine bingo I have a mirror......no having to play with packages Im not sure of on a download.......also I know all the apps on the CD have been integrated into the admin tool kit
[00:32] <linux_galore> bob2: yes but also with the services/apps have a admin interface....ie a beefed up webmin/control center
[00:32] <bob2> hah
[00:33] <Kamion> that's what we're doing with everything in main, not just with the CD
[00:33] <Kamion> only integrating the CD is the lazy distro's approach
[00:33] <linux_galore> yes but no X....just a remote browser login
[00:34] <linux_galore> Kamion: you mean lazy as in "doesnt chew up time"
[00:34] <Kamion> linux_galore: like it or not customers want to install stuff not on the CD, so any sane distro will integrate that stuff too
[00:35] <Kamion> unless your beloved CD is *all* that's supported, in which case they're offering less
[00:35] <linux_galore> Kamion: yes but I dont want to work around a "desktop" CD to install a server....i want a server CD for servers

[00:49] <Xophe> I have been advised to compile an earlier kernel than the Ubuntu-provided 2.6.8.1, to see if the problems I'm having with my CD-ROM drive (mostly ripping CDs) are kernel-related

[00:50] <superted> anyone running hoary here?
[00:50] <Xophe> is there a ubuntuish way of doing this?
[00:50] <Rattboi> superted, a lot are
[00:50] <bluewheel> Xophe, yep well it's the debian way but yes there are smart ways of doing it
[00:50] <bluewheel> Xophe, have you downloaded the source ?
[00:51] <superted> Rattboi: and its all good in the hood? :)
[00:51] <Rattboi> hmm
[00:51] <Rattboi> depends, I guess
[00:51] <Rattboi> what are you expecting?
[00:51] <Xophe> bluewheel: partly I'm wondering whether there are patched sources which should be tried rather than vanilla kernel.org
[00:51] <Rattboi> it's pretty good though
[00:51] <Xophe> I'm familiar enough with make-kpkg
[00:51] <Rattboi> expect instabilities at times
[00:52] <bluewheel> Xophe, i don't know about that i am running a ppc so my kernel is just d/l'ed source form elsewhere

[00:53] <superted> Rattboi: well is it complicated to downgrade afterwards if it gets too unstable?
[00:53] <bluewheel> amd64 might wanna try some user pages ?

[00:55] <Kamion> Xophe: we don't have any amd64-specific patches in our kernel, if that's any guide
[00:55] <BockBilbo> can anyone tell me how to recover grub??
=== umarmung [~Tanzbaer@pD9E682FB.dip.t-dialin.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[00:56] <Xophe> Kamion: that's worth knowing, certainly
[00:56] <Kamion> there're a couple of patches which touch that architecture but they touch other architectures too
[00:56] <Xophe> (the symptoms of this particular problem are that while playing CDs directly works fine, ripping hem causes cdparanoia to go "++++" and sound-juicer to go at approximately 0.3x speed
[00:57] <Xophe>  ... mjg59 said that there were possibly issues with 2.6.8 and .9 with ripping, so...)
[00:58] <bluewheel> BockBilbo, did you install a dud kernel ? might want to use a live cd and then fix your config
[00:58] <BockBilbo> bluewheel, is not that
[00:58] <BockBilbo> the prob is that i have to install win for my parents
[00:58] <BockBilbo> and it will erase grub init
[00:58] <Xophe> Kamion: I presume that this means there isn't a terribly authoritative place to go for earlier ubuntu-flavoured kernels
[00:58] <BockBilbo> so i need to reinstall grub after installing win
=== jpvcx [foobar@j132017.upc-j.chello.nl]  has joined #ubuntu
[00:59] <Kamion> actually, I tell a lie, there's one amd64-specific patch on top of another patch we've applied to add a wireless driver, but that obviously doesn't matter for the upstream kernel
[00:59] <Kamion> Xophe: we don't have a snapshot.debian.net equivalent yet, no

[04:02] <bob2> Xophe: reportbug routes bugs to ubuntu-users
[04:03] <Xophe> and is that a good idea?
[04:03] <rodi> so, speaking of annoyed...  I have one nagging problem left with Hoary, and after a little poking around on the forums and the wiki, haven't found anyone else having it...
[04:03] <rodi> My screen starts to flicker as if the refresh rate is incorrect every time I log in.
[04:04] <fabbione> Xophe: please report bugs only on kernels that come from us
[04:04] <fabbione> Xophe: do not send reports for kernel you compiled yourself
[04:04] <rodi> The problem being that this is an LCD (laptop) and one generally doesn't set the refresh or sync rate on them as far as I understand.
[04:04] <fabbione> Xophe: also.. out kernel is patched.. so it is pointless to use our config on a vanilla kernel

[04:04] <rodi> I thought it might help to install the binary kernel, but it appears to only be available for Warty right now, and I'm not sure it would help anyhow.
[04:04] <rodi> Any sugggestions?
[04:05] <Xophe> fabbione: ok: "my CD-ROM drive does not work for ripping CDs"
[04:05] <Xophe> but the point of building a non-Ubuntu kernel was that I have been informed that there are bugs in 2.6.8.x and 2.6.9.x regarding ripping CDs
[04:06] <Xophe> and before reporting a bug as a kernel bug (probably hardware-specific) I wanted to test this theory
=== murf [~murf@193.165.214.35]  has joined #ubuntu
[04:06] <Xophe> and I have asked here before about earlier builds of Ubuntu-flavoured kernels

[04:06] <Xophe> fabbione: so, suggestions welcome
[04:06] <fabbione> Xophe: if it was such a big problem people would have reported it much earlier than now
[04:07] <murf> hello, who is member of ubuntu team members, there is no list on the website (or i'm blind) ...
[04:07] <Xophe> how many people are running Ubuntu on "IBM IntelliStation A Pro"s?
[04:07] <fabbione> so my suggestion is still report a bug (severity minor) with all possible details, including try more than one tool
[04:07] <fabbione> and not just "cdrip" doesn't work
[04:07] <Xophe> *sigh*
[04:07] <farruinn> Xophe: afaik, linux-source-2.8.* is the ubuntu patched source and kernel-source-* is the unpatched source, so maybe try with linux-source if you haven't already
[04:07] <sgarrity> I'm trying to install ubuntu on a G3 iMac - doesn't anyone know of any free tools to resize a Mac OS X partition? (HFS, I think)
[04:07] <murf> oh ... the correct question was - is there list of ubuntu developer members ?
[04:08] <bob2> murf: there isn't one
[04:08] <murf> bob2: so it sounds like anonymous distribution ....
[04:08] <sid77> sgarrity, never heard of. I know there is something commercial which do the wotk but I'm not too sure about it :(
[04:08] <Xophe> farruinn: sure, but linux-source-2.6.8.1 is precisely not the source I need to try to verify this hypothesis
[04:08] <sgarrity> sid77: Yeah, thought so. Thanks.

[04:34] <sid77> ctr, don't know, but you can ask here
[04:34] <ctr> I managed to mount the disk and unmount it
[04:34] <farruinn> ctr, I find it quite stable
[04:35] <ctr> but I fear reading from it or doing anything with it incase it becomes fubar'd
[04:35] <sid77> mmmh
[04:35] <farruinn> reading is well supported, writing is not so well supported
[04:35] <sid77> farruinn, no hfsplus?
[04:35] <sid77> on
[04:36] <farruinn> hfs is fine afaik, but I believe that writing to hfs+ is a bit buggy
[04:36] <ctr> ahhh
[04:36] <farruinn> but I haven't had any problems
[04:36] <ctr> hmm
[04:36] <ctr> so I should probably, to be safe, mount it read-only ?
[04:36] <farruinn> and you can always use hpmount if you're wary of ruining the disk

[06:01] <RuffianSoldier> well - will this KDE problem be fixed?  I havent used the new KDE yet - i really want to
[06:01] <farruinn> RuffianSoldier: kde is a meta package, so dpkg -i kde.deb won't do you much
[06:02] <RuffianSoldier> well - anyone else have problems install KDE in hoary?

[06:03] <stuNNed_> hi all
[06:03] <RuffianSoldier> bob2 - im guessing some required KDE packages havent been added to the repos yet?  so KDE wont install...... am I correct?
[06:04] <emanuelez> RuffianSoldier, ubuntu developers are not really focusing on kde... i wonder if k3b works...

[06:05] <RuffianSoldier> emanuelez - I have known that for ages - my question is - since the latest KDE is in hoary repos - why am I not able to get it?
[06:05] <gangalino> I'm having trouble understanding how to share my RealPlayer w/ other logins. whereis doesn't even show realplay for other users
=== zAo^^ [~zao@zAo.xs4all.nl]  has joined #ubuntu
[06:05] <zAo^^> lo all
[06:06] <bob2> RuffianSoldier: I don't know, check the bts
[06:06] <bob2> RuffianSoldier: you can't get it because it's not all there
[06:06] <RuffianSoldier> thats what I thought
[06:07] <zAo^^> I had no updates for 3 days now; what is wrong? (standard sources on Warty)
[06:07] <mart> gangalino: how did you install it?
[06:07] <bob2> zAo^^: warty only gets security updates
[06:08] <farruinn> zAo^^: I know, isn't it great! ;-)
[06:08] <RuffianSoldier> zAo^^ Just upgrade to Hoary - I did - and it was easy
[06:09] <gangalino> mart: by typing "./RealPlayer10GOLD.bin". Follow the prompts provided to finish installing the player.
[06:09] <bob2> RuffianSoldier: please don't encourage random people to do that
[06:09] <RuffianSoldier> :-(
[06:09] <RuffianSoldier> ok
