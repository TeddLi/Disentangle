[02:51] <Psil0Cybin> configure encrypted volumes
[02:51] <Psil0Cybin> configure ISCSI volumes
[02:51] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, no, after you choose manual
[02:51] <demophobia> oh no D: need help after all
[02:51] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: i am in manual
[02:51] <buklau> drobuddy, i cant find anythign specific with a wifi card
[02:52] <drobuddy> From personal experience, I highly recommend avoiding encrypted volumes unless you really know what you're doing. They are a pain to recover if you're not careful
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> psusi:  I now see
[02:52] <demophobia> At https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsNetgear I click the link for WNA1100, but it -- http://sourceforge.net/projects/ath9...htc-installer/ -- leads to 'page not found' error
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> all 3 hard drives, no parttitons
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> within them all
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> 1 TB each hard drive.
[02:52] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, instead of add or remove a partition, you want new partition table / disk label
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> oh
[02:52] <VLanX> is there any chance with dd or anything else to read a file from and device and discard the data? In other words, I need to perform a true read benchmark on a remote NFS partition...
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> i cannot find that option
[02:52] <demophobia> oh, but that was last updated 2 years ago
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> i will keep looking
[02:52] <k_sze[work]> Which minor version of Python 3 brought back the u'' syntax? I forget. Was it 3.2?
[02:52] <demophobia> maybe i don't need to install anything after all ...
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> OH I SEE
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> new partition table
[02:52] <Psil0Cybin> so i select YES
[02:52] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[02:52] <buklau> drobuddy, i only see network card if that would work
[02:53] <drobuddy> buklau: PM me the manufacturer and version
[02:53] <drobuddy> buklau: Desktop or laptop?
[02:53] <Psil0Cybin> so now it says psusi: it will remove all existing raid parttions
[02:53] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, *breathe*... take a few seconds to finish your thought before you whack that enter key.
[02:53] <Psil0Cybin> on that hard drive I select YES
[02:53] <Psil0Cybin> sorry psusi: been on this nonsense all day long dealing with this since 10 AM, I am exausted and just want the O.S to boot up so i can call it a night, but thanks lte me take a deep breath ahd continue
[02:53] <psusi> yep, and pick msdos
[02:54] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: when I ceated the second parttion table, it never asks MSDOS or anything it just said it would remove and i selected yes
[02:54] <Psil0Cybin> and it wrote down right away pri/log
[02:54] <Psil0Cybin> beside the second 1 TB Free space.
[02:54] <Psil0Cybin> on the second hard drive, is this normal?
[02:54]  * demophobia returned the previous wireless adapter and now has > Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0846:9030 NetGear, Inc. WNA1100 Wireless-N 150 [Atheros AR9271]
[02:54] <psusi> ok, I think it may have picked the type by default and that's fine
[02:54] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[02:55] <psusi> now create your partition, primary, on all 3 disks, type set to raid physical volume
[02:55] <Psil0Cybin> okay psusi: so i follow you correctly
[02:55] <Psil0Cybin> i will have 1 partiton, in each drive, correct?
[02:55] <Akiva-Mobile> what is the chat for unity developers? I have an idea I want to propose
[02:56] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: when creating the second raid
[02:56] <Psil0Cybin> it asks primary or logical?
[02:57] <drobuddy> Any wireless tethering gurus in here? Mine is acting up. `ip link show` shows usb0's state as UNKNOWN, albeit recognized by Saucy and it used to work ~2 months ago.
[02:58] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, same thing on all 3 drives: one big primary partition, usage: raid
[02:58] <drobuddy> When I say recognized, it shows connected in the systray, but not when I run ifconfig usb0 down, et al.
[02:58] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: okay
[02:58] <Psil0Cybin> so now i have 3 hard drives, 1 partition each
[02:58] <Psil0Cybin> all raid.
[02:58] <drobuddy> It shows the device as being unrecognized when I check via CLI
[02:59] <Psil0Cybin> 1.0 TB each partition.
[02:59] <Psil0Cybin> do i hit finish parttioning and write changes to disk?
[02:59] <Psil0Cybin> or what do i do now.
[02:59] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, there should be an option to set up raid... it *might* be after you finish partitioning and write changes to disk
[02:59] <Beldar> Akiva-Mobile, I doubt there is one open to anyone, and I doubt it would be considered.
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> there is psusi
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> it says
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> on top Configure Software Riad
[03:00] <psusi> hit that one
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:00] <psusi> create a new raid5 array, and it will ask you what partitions to use.. check all 3
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> ERror informing the kernel about modifcations to partition /dev/sda1 device or resource busy
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> this mean lonux wont know about any chances to made to /dev/sda1 until yo9u reboot
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> is that fine?\
[03:00] <psusi> ugh.... no
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> ignore or cancel.
[03:01] <Beldar> Akiva-Mobile, This would have to be a go up the hierarchy sort of thing, there is a general new ubuntu idea post page, or there used to be anyway.
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> ugh psusi: so it is not working?
[03:01] <drobuddy> I'm really surprised I can't find anything on Google or insight in here on tethering... Apparently it's used less than I thought (which, I'm only trying to use it due to dire straits at the moment).
[03:01] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, can you pick the erase option on each partition now?
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> yes
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> if i sleect a parttion
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> i can see Erase data on this partition
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> or
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> Delete the partition
[03:02] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, do that, and reboot, and you should run straight back to the create raid array step.. the 3 partitions should still be there
[03:02] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, pick erase, not delete
[03:02] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, on all 3 partitions
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> so erase each partition?
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:02] <Akiva-Mobile> Beldar: I'd be passing it over, see what they think, and then looking to write a patch myself. Its a good practical idea.
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> perfect
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> says
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> Data has not beeen erased
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> Error Erasing data
[03:03] <Psil0Cybin> it wont let me erase.
[03:03] <psusi> blarg
[03:03] <Psil0Cybin> is there no easier way
[03:03] <Psil0Cybin> to remove all partitions and do this?
[03:04] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, ok... hit alt and right arrow and see if you get to a command prompt
[03:04] <Psil0Cybin> i do
[03:04] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, these 3 drives are the only ones in the system?  they were sda, sdb, and sdc?
[03:05] <Psil0Cybin> yes
[03:05] <Psil0Cybin> that is correct
[03:05] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, and they have nothing you want to keep on them?
[03:05] <Psil0Cybin> yes
[03:05] <Psil0Cybin> that is correct
[03:05] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:05] <Psil0Cybin> it is a brand new system.
[03:05] <Psil0Cybin> I just want to get Ubuntu Server O.S on it :'(
[03:05] <Beldar> Akiva-Mobile, Well good luck with that, this is support and not directly associated with canonical. ;)
[03:05] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, type dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M count=1, then hit enter, then hit up, and change it to sdb and repeat, and again for sdc
[03:05] <Psil0Cybin> okay one second

[03:08] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:08] <Psil0Cybin> one second
[03:08] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, then reboot and you should be starting fresh with a clean slate

[03:08] <Beldar> Akiva-Mobile, Cool, suggest away.
[03:08] <Psil0Cybin> sorry, thank you psusi i am rebooting now, and will ask you once I get to the parttion menu again is that okay?
[03:08] <drobuddy> Damn, I have to disconnect before I get charged for overages.
[03:08] <Psil0Cybin> I am just sooo lost when it comes to raid, systems....but I am slowly learning
[03:08] <drobuddy> I wish you all the best of luck with your respective endeavors.
[03:09] <drobuddy> Peace.
[03:09] <Psil0Cybin> ty drobuddy good night
[03:09] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, unfortunately, there are a few bugs you are running into when you don't do it right the first time and try to redo it
[03:09] <drobuddy> np, you too
[03:10] <Psil0Cybin> hopefully i get this solved, with the help of psusi.
[03:10] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: do u think i can solve this issue though now that we have done the following?
[03:10] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, yes, should be smooth sailing now... create the 3 partitions again, type raid, primary, then move on to the raid step
[03:10] <VLanX> Actually copying from FN to a ramdisk I can max-out the 1gbps link, with 95% idle on the CPU  :3
[03:10] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, you did repeat the dd with 2M on all 3 drives right?
[03:10] <Psil0Cybin> yes yes
[03:10] <psusi> smooth sailing now...
[03:10] <Psil0Cybin> i will msg you after i made the 3 primary raid partitions
[03:13] <Psil0Cybin> okay psusi: up to speed. all 3 primary 1.0 TB partitions
[03:13] <Psil0Cybin> seems like the thing u showed me fixed the bugs
[03:13] <Psil0Cybin> now i am going to configure software raid.
[03:13] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:13] <Psil0Cybin> now i am at create md device/delete md device/ finish
[03:14] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, now create the raid array, check all 3 partitions, and then you set the raid array ( md0 ) to be the root, ext4
[03:14] <psusi> and that should do it
[03:14] <Psil0Cybin> so it is asking what kind of raid do i want to create
[03:14] <Psil0Cybin> RAID0, raid1, raid5, raid6, raid10
[03:15] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: sorry i amgoing to ask you slowly, i really need to be spoon fed at this point so i do not have to do this all over again :P
[03:15] <Psil0Cybin> this is the one part i am worried about
=== siva is now known as Guest19333
[03:15] <Psil0Cybin> the next few steps if that is okay with you, sorry I am super lost...so I would select Raid 5 correct?
[03:15] <Psil0Cybin> at this step?
[03:16] <Eromej> Hello, is it normal my screen brightness lowers when I grab a window and snap it on the side? Ubuntu 12.04
[03:16] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, you wanted raid5, so yea
[03:17] <Psil0Cybin> okay cool, so i type 3 active devices for the raid5 array obviously.
[03:17] <Psil0Cybin> nbecause its 3 hard drives, correct?
[03:17] <psusi> yep, then pick the 3 partitions
[03:17] <benague> hey guys im new here just testing irc over ssh tunneling :))
[03:17] <Psil0Cybin> is says
[03:17] <Psil0Cybin> number of spare devices
[03:17] <Psil0Cybin> 0

[03:17] <Psil0Cybin> okay now i select all the raid partitions so

[03:18] <Psil0Cybin> continue?
[03:18] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, I swear, I'm going to have to come hook up a wire to your pinky finger and shock you each time you hit enter too soon, yes, continue ;)
[03:18] <phunyguy> Psil0Cybin: if FloodBot1 is warning you, then maybe you should listen.

[03:18] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: hahahahha, sorryy guys!! I promiss, i will amputate my finger after this ! I really am sorry!!
[03:19] <demophobia> Psil0Cybin, let your yes mean yes and your no mean no -- please don't promise such a thing. ._.
[03:19] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: okay so i selected them all and now it took me back to the menu that says create md device, delete md dcevice or finish, i am assuming i hit finish since i just sleected all the partitons
[03:19] <Psil0Cybin> corect?
[03:20] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, yes, and then you should be back at the partitioning screen where you should have a new device: md0.. that's the raid.. set it to / and ext4 and continue
[03:20] <demophobia> goodnight
[03:21] <Psil0Cybin> okay psusi: sorry i am back to that menu you just described ,it I see RAID5 Device #0 - 2.0 TB #1 2.0 TB and 5.12.0 B unusable
[03:21] <Psil0Cybin> is that what i set to /
[03:21] <Guest19333> hai...anyone know about remote desktop connection setting
[03:21] <Psil0Cybin> its only one partition in the raid device, and the 3 parttions bellow
[03:21] <Psil0Cybin> how do i set it to
[03:22] <Psil0Cybin> "/" and ext4?
[03:22] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, yes, set that to use / as the mount point, and ext4 as the filesystem
[03:22] <Psil0Cybin> Okay
[03:23] <Psil0Cybin> so it says ext4 and /
[03:23] <Psil0Cybin> under the raid5 device.
[03:23] <Psil0Cybin> So now do i hit finish partitoning and write changes to disk?
[03:23] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, yes
[03:23] <Psil0Cybin> okay *fingers crossed*
[03:23] <Psil0Cybin> You have not selected any partitions for us as swap space
[03:23] <Psil0Cybin> enabling swap space is recommended so that the system can make better use of physical memory
[03:23] <psusi> ignore
[03:24] <Psil0Cybin> it just says Yes or No
[03:24] <Psil0Cybin> to return to partioning menu
[03:24] <Psil0Cybin> so no
[03:24] <psusi> do you want to go back?  hell no.. ramming speed!
[03:24] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:24] <Psil0Cybin> writting changes to disk
[03:24] <Psil0Cybin> *fingers crossed*

[03:25] <psusi> note that I'm pretty sure if you had just picked guided raid instead of manual it would have taken care of all of that for you ;)
[03:26] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: there was no guided raid option...
[03:26] <Psil0Cybin> other people tried to help me all day it was wierd
[03:26] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, there was, you mentioned it earlier...

[03:43] <Psil0Cybin> and vlume
[03:43] <Psil0Cybin> its not working
[03:43] <Psil0Cybin> can i not fix this grub menu?
[03:43] <Psil0Cybin> i just installed it, how do i boot in?
[03:44] <Jordan_U> Psil0Cybin: It depends on why you're getting a grub rescue shell. You can try: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#GRUB-only-offers-a-rescue-shell
[03:45] <Psil0Cybin> is there any other linux os
[03:45] <Jordan_U> Psil0Cybin: You can also try using a Super GRUB2 Disk CD to boot your installed system.
[03:45] <Psil0Cybin> no CD drive.
[03:45] <Psil0Cybin> i cant figure this out
[03:46] <Psil0Cybin> i usally have no problems
[03:46] <Psil0Cybin> only with this raid, can i never get the OS to boot.
[03:46] <Psil0Cybin> everything i do causes other problems
[03:46] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, ok, at the grub rescue shell, type ls and tell me what it says
[03:46] <Psil0Cybin> (hd0) (hd0, msdos1)
[03:46] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, damn... how about set?
[03:47] <Psil0Cybin> prefix=(mduuid/a62d76fbf6a....
[03:47] <ariane5> i install on ubuntu java and flash and ubuntu is unstabile why ?
[03:47] <Jordan_U> Psil0Cybin: Then for some reasob your BIOS is only presenting one of your 3 drives to grub.
[03:47] <Psil0Cybin> root=mduuid/a62d76fbf64e75...
[03:47] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, ahh... yes, it looks like your bios is broken and only sees one drive
[03:47] <Psil0Cybin> WeLL the guys who built the machine said they did a hard drive Raid!
[03:47] <Psil0Cybin> and i should be able to install the OS as ONE partition
[03:47] <Psil0Cybin> but that was NEVER the case.
[03:48] <Psil0Cybin> I am sooooo confused....
[03:48] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, wait... I think you may be mixing up hardware raid and craptastic fakeraid
[03:48] <Psil0Cybin> do i take this machine back to the store?
[03:48] <Psil0Cybin> is this machine useless, i am confused
[03:48] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, boot the livecd, and run dmraid -s
[03:48] <Psil0Cybin> so
[03:48] <Psil0Cybin> boot a live cd ?
[03:48] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, or better yet, is there a raid option in the bios?
[03:48] <Psil0Cybin> yes
[03:48] <Psil0Cybin> i think so psusi
[03:48] <Psil0Cybin> that was
[03:48] <Psil0Cybin> in the option
[03:48] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:48] <Guest19333> does anyone know about XRDP
[03:48] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, ok, that's the craptastic fakeraid... go into the bios and blow that junk all away
[03:49] <Jordan_U> Psil0Cybin: Does "ls (hd0,msdos1)/" list any files?
[03:49] <psusi> Jordan_U, it won't.. the bios still thinks it's set up as a fakeraid, but he's reformatted it using mdadm
[03:49] <Psil0Cybin> psusi:
[03:49] <Psil0Cybin> it says
[03:49] <Psil0Cybin> under Peripherals
[03:50] <Psil0Cybin> OnChip SATA TYPE
[03:50] <Psil0Cybin> RAID
[03:50] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:50] <Psil0Cybin> OnChip STA CONTROLLER enabled.
[03:50] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, there should be something during boot that says press some key combo for raid setup... hit that, and delete the bloody fake raid array
[03:50] <Psil0Cybin> it says onChop SATA Type: Raid
[03:50] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:50] <Psil0Cybin> one second!
[03:50] <MartynKeigher> hey all
[03:50] <Jordan_U> psusi: Clearly there is a device visible with at least a partition table.
[03:51] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:51] <Psil0Cybin> gives me
[03:51] <Psil0Cybin> Delete LD Menu
[03:51] <Psil0Cybin> Controller configuration LD VIew / LD Define
[03:51] <Psil0Cybin> View Drive ASsignments
[03:51] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, then go back to that first setting, and change it from RAID to AHCI...
[03:51] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:51] <Psil0Cybin> okay so how do i remove all the software raid?
[03:51] <MartynKeigher>  got an upstart issue.... going through this.... http://wiki.manageditby.us/2013/08/10/dashing-upstart-script/
[03:51] <Psil0Cybin> Delete LD Menu?
[03:51] <psusi> Jordan_U, yea.. because it sees the partition table on the first disk and thinks it is the partition table on the fakeraid array
[03:51] <Psil0Cybin> or view
[03:51] <Psil0Cybin> drive assignemnts?
[03:52] <MartynKeigher> looks good. its worked before... just thinking if i need any dependencies to make this run
[03:52] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, whatever you have to do in there to delete the raid array so they are all just plain, normal drives
[03:52] <Psil0Cybin> so i just
[03:52] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:52] <MartynKeigher> right now it says: root@DASHING01:/etc/init# sudo start thin   start: Unknown job: thin
[03:52] <Psil0Cybin> i am just scared ill mess something up
[03:52] <Psil0Cybin> i do not know what naything of this in the Raid Menu
[03:52] <Jordan_U> psusi: Which for RAID1 might not be a problem.
[03:52] <Psil0Cybin> psusi:
[03:52] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, can't be any more messed up than it is now ;)
[03:53] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:53] <Psil0Cybin> so CTRL + H
[03:53] <psusi> Jordan_U, yea.. but he's using raid5
[03:53] <Psil0Cybin> says securly erase.
[03:53] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:53] <Psil0Cybin> so i erase all raid
[03:53] <Psil0Cybin> ?
[03:53] <Jordan_U> psusi: Ahh, carry on then :)
[03:53] <Psil0Cybin> like CTRL H on all drives?
[03:53] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, no... you don't want to erase the whole drive... just delete the array
[03:53] <Psil0Cybin> gives m no option for array
[03:53] <Psil0Cybin> Ctrl H, CTRL V to view backup disk
[03:53] <Psil0Cybin> exit and up and down
[03:54] <Psil0Cybin> or Delete LD Menu
[03:54] <Psil0Cybin> Controller Config
[03:54] <Psil0Cybin> LD View.
[03:54] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, delete LD
[03:54] <psusi> delete delete delete... delete it all
[03:54] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:54] <Psil0Cybin> it says
[03:54] <Psil0Cybin> CTRL -Y to delete tthe data in the disk
[03:54] <Psil0Cybin> though
[03:54] <Psil0Cybin> i see it has the raid
[03:54] <truba> hi guys
[03:54] <Psil0Cybin> LD No 1 RAID 5 DR 3
[03:54] <MartynKeigher> do i need to install anything special that is not in ubuntu (out of the box) to get upstart to run conf files?
[03:54] <Psil0Cybin> Capacity 1999.99
[03:54] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, it sees the *wrong* raid.. that's why you need to delete it
[03:55] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:55] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:55] <Psil0Cybin> deleted
[03:55] <Psil0Cybin> NO LD
[03:55] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:55] <Psil0Cybin> There is no any LD it says lol
[03:55] <Psil0Cybin> now i reboot?
[03:55] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, good... now go back to that first option you found and change it from RAID to AHCI to turn that fake raid crap off
[03:55] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:55] <Psil0Cybin> Its go time, One second ill keep u posted
[03:56] <Psil0Cybin> on those  changes.
[03:56] <psusi> then you just might boot up ok... unless the bios erased the start of the disk, which I think it does... in which case, you have to reinstall ( again )
[03:56] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[03:56] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: if that is the case
[03:56] <Psil0Cybin> i should be on the right track tho
[03:56] <Psil0Cybin> now that i did this stuff
[03:56] <truba> I have a problem in fresh installation of ubuntu 12.04 in laptop I am using lxde as a desktop environment to gain on RAM. however I am experiencing that my CPU fans are running at a high speed even when the cpu utilization is very low, I 've checked it using htop, sensors.
[03:56] <Psil0Cybin> one second let merestart and change bios crap
[03:56] <psusi> yes, should be smooth sailing this time...
[03:56] <Psil0Cybin> ty
[03:57] <Psil0Cybin> it might have worked
[03:57] <Psil0Cybin> i see Ubuntu gae :P
[03:57] <truba> I have even installed Nvidia propreity graphics card. everything is ohk but the cpu fans are runnning quite fast even the htop is showing that there is no cpu utilization.
[03:57] <Psil0Cybin> clicked it to boot, lets see.
[03:57] <psusi> they set you up with a bios fake raid... so the bios was trying to use the drives in a raid, and there's a driver for Windows to take over and use that setup... but when you created the raid array in the Ubuntu installer like you did, that's pure software raid.. have to use one or the other, not both
[03:57] <Psil0Cybin> so far just a black screen
[03:58] <truba> Has anyone experienced such problem ??
[03:58] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: so now i rebooted
[03:58] <Psil0Cybin> it shows the Grub
[03:58] <Psil0Cybin> but when i boot the O.S i just get a black screen
[03:58] <Psil0Cybin> so is this what i would fix by reinstalling now?
[03:58] <psusi> hrm.. no...
[03:58] <psusi> you get the grub menu, and when you hit enter, it just stays black?
[03:58] <Psil0Cybin> yes
[03:58] <Psil0Cybin> let me try again
[03:59] <Psil0Cybin> yea  see grub
[03:59] <psusi> try the rescue mode option and give it some time
[03:59] <Psil0Cybin> it shows me, the OS and the recovery, but it just stays black
[03:59] <Psil0Cybin> OH WOOPS
[03:59] <Psil0Cybin> IT WORKED
[03:59] <Psil0Cybin> IT WORKED
[03:59] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:59] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: I booted in!! omfg.. sorry I am soooo happppy...now all i need to do is get my ethernet driver working LMAFO!
[03:59] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: i think you diserve a kiss.
[04:00] <Psil0Cybin> let me jut do a sudo shutdown -r now
[04:00] <Psil0Cybin> to double check its not a fluke
[04:00] <MartynKeigher> can someone help me with an upstart isse? trying to start a server ( a /etc/init/thin.conf file) and it says Unknown Service??
[04:01] <tsimpson> Psil0Cybin: please try and lay off the enter key
[04:01] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, do keep in mind that raid is no substitute for backups... it's for not having to restore from backup just because a drive fails...
[04:02] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: yea ofcourse i am going to back up, this is a server for work i am setting up...for my boss. So we are going to get a few external hard drive hubs
[04:02] <Psil0Cybin> okay i got the O.S t owork
[04:02] <Psil0Cybin> i think i might relax tonight and get back to that ethernet driver later,unless psusi you are up for helping me with that too lmaooo
=== Logan_ is now known as GroupContact
[04:03] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, my only advice on that is that if it doesn't work out of the box, it's probably not going to work ;)
[04:03] <Psil0Cybin> oh actually....
[04:03] <Psil0Cybin> someone said that i could try to reinstall the driver my self
[04:04] <Psil0Cybin> that that would fix that issue, because they said it was configuring inproperly for that driver or something...does that make sense or actually i am screwed?
[04:04] <psusi> by and large, drivers are built into the kernel so it just works
[04:04] <Psil0Cybin> because i need this computer for a server, if the driver is not working for the ethernet this is baaaaad news
[04:04] <Psil0Cybin> for me actually
[04:04] <Psil0Cybin> well
[04:04] <Psil0Cybin> Ifconfig
[04:04] <Psil0Cybin> does not even show the ethernet drive.
[04:04] <Psil0Cybin> so i think the driver is just fully missing.
[04:04] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[04:04] <psusi> yep, which is unusual, but if that's the case, you're SOL
[04:05] <Psil0Cybin> SOL?
[04:05] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, might not hurt to check the output of lspci -vvvv and see if you can find the card there
[04:05] <psusi> SOL = Shit out of Luck ;)
[04:05] <Psil0Cybin> actually.....
[04:06] <Psil0Cybin> someone else said it would be easy to just copy it on a USB
[04:06] <Psil0Cybin> and install it from the USB
[04:06] <phunyguy> !language
[04:06] <ubottu> Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional.
[04:06] <Psil0Cybin> thats really bad....really....psusi i am kind of shocked
[04:06] <Psil0Cybin> that is the only thing i can do.....nothing
[04:06] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, except that there's nothing to copy or install... as a general rule, Linux does not have third party drivers to install, they are just built into the kernel
[04:06] <Psil0Cybin> oh no
[04:06] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: im actually going to kill my self lollll jks, but my boss just bought this 800$ server
[04:06] <Psil0Cybin> for us to use
[04:07] <Psil0Cybin> so ur saying it will have no etho? lmao
[04:07] <Psil0Cybin> and theres nadda i can do
[04:07] <Psil0Cybin> ?
[04:07] <psusi> well, there *may* be hope... it is pretty darn unusual for there to be an ethernet controller that linux doesn't support
[04:07] <Psil0Cybin> yea
[04:07] <Psil0Cybin> thats what i am thinking
[04:07] <Psil0Cybin> maybe i just need to do alot of research
[04:07] <psusi> wifi on the other hand, sometimes aren't and there are ways to install the windows driver and use that
[04:07] <Psil0Cybin> tonight
[04:07] <Psil0Cybin> yea psuis well
[04:07] <Psil0Cybin> the thing is i think i might have windows drivers for the etho
[04:07] <Psil0Cybin> just this server doesnt even pick up the eto
[04:08] <Psil0Cybin> so im wondering if that might solve the problems
[04:08] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[04:08] <Psil0Cybin> or if i can find a etho driver for my hardware, becasue it doesnt even turn on
[04:08] <psusi> what kind of card is it?
[04:08] <Psil0Cybin> how can i find out i forgot the command
[04:08] <psusi> read the specs for the hardware you bought, or try sudo lspci -v
[04:09] <Psil0Cybin> okay Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co Ltd RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller rev 06
[04:09] <phunyguy> which version of Ubuntu? (I could scroll up, but meh)
[04:09] <Psil0Cybin> 12.04 Server
[04:09] <phunyguy> which kernel?
[04:09] <Psil0Cybin> 3.8.0-29 generic
[04:09] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, hrm... realtek is generally supported pretty well... you might try the desktop cd for 13.04 rather than 12.04
[04:09] <phunyguy> yeah... even with that, I can't get it working on my newest laptop.  Same deal, no ethernet.
[04:09] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: well i used the 12.04
[04:10] <Psil0Cybin> desktop iso and it worked fine
[04:10] <Psil0Cybin> well it did not work at all actually
[04:10] <Psil0Cybin> didnt work with the desktop either
[04:10] <Psil0Cybin> not that i think about it, sorry for spamming again with the neter key it is just hard sometimes and i forget.
[04:10] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, so what does sudo ifconfig eth0 say?
[04:10] <phunyguy> You can try the mainline kernel to see if that is the issue.
[04:10] <Psil0Cybin> error fetching interface information
[04:10] <Psil0Cybin> device not found
[04:10] <Psil0Cybin> woops
[04:10] <Psil0Cybin> one sec
[04:10] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[04:10] <phunyguy> /headdesk
[04:10] <dogmover> Psil0Cybin: is the network plugged into the card? And are the lights on at the port on the pc?
[04:10] <Bashing-om> Psil0Cybin: I Have been watching,, for driver situation see:https://code.google.com/p/r8168/, then also ubuntuforums, lots there about this driver - chili55 -.
[04:11] <Robr3rd> So I've got Ubuntu 13.04 (in GNOME Shell 3.8). I just installed wireless mini-PCIe card and I am trying to set it up to be a hotspot to channel my Internet from the Ethernet port to all my other devices. The wireless card works and the hotspot capabilities also work fine, however the Ethernet on the motherboard says "Connecting" but never actually completes the connection.
[04:11] <Psil0Cybin> it says: Link ecap ethernet HWaddr 94:de:880:b1:46:94
[04:11] <Psil0Cybin> Broadcast Multicast MTU:150 metric 1
[04:11] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, looks like it's working then...
[04:11] <Robr3rd> I have also disabled the wireless card and the Ethernet port behaves the same.
[04:11] <Psil0Cybin> hmm psusi but no internet, but when i plug that etho into my laptop
[04:11] <Psil0Cybin> i get internet.
[04:12] <Psil0Cybin> no lights on the back
[04:12] <Psil0Cybin> for the eth0
[04:12] <Psil0Cybin> looks like its dead, in the machine type thing
[04:12] <Psil0Cybin> before it wsa lighting up red in the back when i plugged it in, now it does not.
[04:12] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, what do you have it plugged into?
[04:12] <Psil0Cybin> the eth0 wire into the computer and into my router.
[04:12] <Psil0Cybin> *slot*&
[04:13] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, and no light on either end?
[04:13] <Psil0Cybin> light on the router end, not the pc end.
[04:13] <Psil0Cybin> one sec lemme try something
[04:13] <Psil0Cybin> gunna try a diff wire.
[04:13] <Hydr0p0nX> is it possible to override the codecs under /proc/asound/card...  ?
[04:14] <Psil0Cybin> no luck, light stays on the router end, but does not stay on the machine end.
[04:14] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, does ifconfig say it is up?  or has any rx packets?
[04:15] <glitsj16> psusi: someone gave Psil0Cybin a link way earlier on .. it seems his network card is being wrongly recognised as needing the r8619 driver rather than the r8168 one .. http://www.rvdavid.net/how-to-get-gigabit-speeds-from-rtl81118168b-pci-express-gigabit-ethernet-controller-on-ubuntu-linux/
[04:15] <Psil0Cybin> yes that is the one, I was ust confused I downloaded the driver
[04:15] <Psil0Cybin> onto a USB
[04:16] <psusi> the windows driver is useless
[04:16] <Psil0Cybin> but the guy also said I needed the essentials pack to install the driver, hmmm.
[04:18] <psusi> that link sounds a bit suspect and outdated to me
[04:18] <ubuntuaddicted> anyone in here ever install LXDE within Xubuntu?
[04:18] <glitsj16> psusi: hitsuijiTMO gave it to him, that's "the guy" ;)
[04:18] <ubuntuaddicted> i want to try another DE, maybe give LXDE a try..
[04:19] <somsip> ubuntuaddicted: just ask the real question and someone will answer if they can
[04:19] <Psil0Cybin> yes :) that is who i was talking too but when i do the ifconfig, eth0 does not pop up when i ddid sudo ifconfig eth0 i got the RX packets and TX packets, everything is 0
[04:19] <ubuntuaddicted> somsip, i did
[04:19] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, try sudo dhclient eth0
[04:20] <Psil0Cybin> wow did that, looks like its processing its running the command and its at _
[04:20] <Psil0Cybin> but the light is on in the back eth0 card.
[04:22] <FireMedic> somsip: You can add lubuntu to your installation by doing sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop
[04:22] <Psil0Cybin> looks like it is just stuck on _ psusi like the only way to stop is to do CTRL+C and retype the command again, but the eth0 light in the back of the computer is glowing red, so it woke somthing up.
[04:22] <ubuntuaddicted> what's the main difference if I install lubuntu-desktop vs just lxde?
[04:22] <Psil0Cybin> but after i hit CTRL+C and tpye in ping, its unknown host again, so I see nothing actually got working :P
[04:22] <somsip> FireMedic: I'm not asking. ubuntuaddicted is.
[04:22] <Temper> is there an easy way to enable and configure a network?
[04:22] <FireMedic> sorry somsip
[04:22] <Temper> lshw says the network card is DISABLED
[04:22] <somsip> ubuntuaddicted: you use the meta package lubuntu-desktop
[04:23] <somsip> FireMedic: np :)
[04:23] <glitsj16> ubuntuaddicted: lubuntu-desktop installs more apps to get the full DE, lxdr is a subset of that
[04:23] <ubuntuaddicted> i just want to try a different DE, i don't want all the apps that come along with lbuntu.
[04:23] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, looks like the card works fine, you just somehow didn't configure it when installing
[04:23] <sasha|> Hai
[04:23] <somsip> !info lxde
[04:23] <ubottu> lxde (source: lxde-common): Meta-package for the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.5.0-4ubuntu4 (saucy), package size 2 kB, installed size 30 kB
[04:23] <sasha|> Does anyone have a good tutorial about how to read smartctl data?
[04:23] <sasha|> Like, I'm totally stumped
[04:24] <psusi> sasha|, stumped how?
[04:24] <sasha|> well, I don't know what all the things mean
[04:24] <somsip> glitsj16: thanks for that - I assumed wrong
[04:24] <sasha|> so I was thinking there was a man page or something (but not a man page)
[04:24] <Temper> if i type ifup it does not work on eth2 since it is disabled in lshw.. how do i setup the network card?
[04:25] <psusi> sasha|, generally the only things you need be concerned with are the count of reallocated, pending, or offline_uncorrectable sectors
[04:25] <glitsj16> somsip: no problem, i do many times 'assume wrong that is)
[04:25] <sasha|>   5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   041   041   140    Pre-fail  Always   FAILING_NOW 1265
[04:25] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, did you have the cable plugged in when installing?
[04:26] <psusi> sasha|, yep, dead driver
[04:26] <sasha|> well fuck me
[04:26] <sasha|> just installed the hard drive
[04:26] <psusi> sasha|, what kind of drive is it?
[04:26] <somsip> !language | sasha|
[04:26] <ubottu> sasha|: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional.
[04:26] <sasha|> sorry :/
[04:26] <sasha|> psusi Model Family:     Western Digital Caviar Blue Serial ATA, Device Model:     WDC WD5000AAKS-00YGA0
[04:27] <psusi> sasha|, time to RMA it I guess... I wouldn't have been surprised if it were a green drive
[04:27] <adars> hola
[04:27] <ubuntuaddicted> i just want to try another very very light weight DE to rule out a possible bug with XFCE. any suggestions?
[04:27] <sasha|> psusi thing is, I found it at the junk yard
[04:27] <sasha|> that's 'new' for me :P
[04:27] <psusi> sasha|, ahh, there's the reason it was in the junk yard ;)
[04:28] <sasha|> yeah I was thinking what on earth a 500gb hdd is doing here :P
[04:28] <sasha|> so, take it out?
[04:28] <psusi> sasha|, yep... I just picked up 3 1 TB WD blue drives for only $70 a pop on newegg...
[04:28] <truba> has anyone worked with cpufrequtils in ubuntu 12.04
[04:29] <Psil0Cybin> okay i am back from having my ciggie, hopefully now i will click enter less i did the sudo dhclient eth0 it get stuck on that command though and the only way to stop it is with CTRL+ C but while its in that process i can see the red light is on in theb ack of the computer
[04:29] <sasha|> psusi that's rather expensive imo, picked up a 1.5tb wd in ~12 ish for ~$70
[04:29] <sasha|> and now 3tb's are going for ~$130 where I live
[04:29] <psusi> sasha|, was it a green?
[04:29] <sasha|> yiss
[04:30] <sasha|> green and segate storage max or something
[04:30] <psusi> yea, they are cheaper and have less warranty, less performance, and tend to fail a lot.. I think I got the same drive about the same time
[04:30] <psusi> and now it's crapping out
[04:30] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: if i do ifconfig now although eth0 shows up instead of just lo before.
[04:30] <sasha|> tbh, my server is filled from drives from the junk yard
[04:30] <psusi> hence, the new blues
[04:31] <sasha|> the only drives I bought were a handful of 2tb and a 3tb over the years for storing movies and tv shows
[04:31] <sasha|> but I was wondering why my ubuntu seedbox was flaking out all the time :P
[04:31] <psusi> sasha|, I had a nice ssd I picked up along with the 1.5 tb green drive back in.. think I actually got it in '11... both of died now, so I got 3 new blues and put them in a raid10 so I don't have to deal with failure again
[04:32] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: is there anything I can do now? that i can see the eth0 within ifconfig? is that a step closer?
[04:32] <sasha|> tldr; I should stop being a cheap ass
[04:32] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: i had the cable connected when installing, but it could not configure anything network wise.
[04:32] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, looks like the card is working, you just don't have networking set up properly so it doesn't know where your default route and dns servers are... this is set up automatically on desktop, but server you may need some manual configuration, though I thought the installer generally set it up for you automatically these days
[04:32] <Psil0Cybin> I had to manually, do it.
[04:32] <MartynKeigher> can someone help me with an upstart isse? trying to start a server ( a /etc/init/thin.conf file) and it says Unknown Service??
[04:33] <MartynKeigher> looked through the debug but not seeing anything obviuos what could be wrong.
[04:33] <sasha|> literally, entire computer is form the junkyard, it must be ~8 or so years old. ran rtorrent and a bunch of torrenty things fine but then it started crashing with 400+ torrents, so I was wondering why
[04:33] <MartynKeigher> tried sudo service thin start'
[04:33] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: the installer did ask to configure it , but it said it could not be configured nad needed to be done manually, even though the eth cable works for otre machines and gthye get on the internet no problem the second they are connected
[04:33] <Psil0Cybin> so i was having specific problems with the server setup
[04:33] <MartynKeigher> tried 'sudo service thin start' and 'sudo start thin' still no luck....Unkown service?'
[04:34] <Beldar> ubuntuaddicted, What release are you using and do you want to be able to remove this new de if installed?
[04:34] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, sounds like you should be able to plug it in at work, and you just need to manually configre it by editing /etc/network/interfaces
[04:34] <MartynKeigher> i then did 'service --status all' and thin is NOT listed??
[04:34] <ubuntuaddicted> Beldar, i am using Xubuntu 12.04.3 and yes, i'd like to be able to remove it if it's not too much hassle.
[04:35] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: I did plug it into my work router, and it did not work during the intall but your saying I should be able to edit those files now, that ifconfig states that eth0 is up?
[04:35] <Psil0Cybin> just cannot connect to the internet
[04:35] <psusi> MartynKeigher, what the heck is "thin"?
[04:35] <rosentrotter> What version should I install if my PC specs are 3GB Ram and 2Ghz CPU
[04:35] <MartynKeigher> web service
[04:35] <ubuntuaddicted> Beldar, wouldn't be the end of the world if I could though as I have back ups of my / paritition I can restore to in case of emergency
[04:35] <rosentrotter> of Ubuntu
[04:35] <Psil0Cybin> restarted the computer psusi and ifconfig still states eth0 is gone now
[04:35] <Psil0Cybin> that i restarted.
[04:35] <Psil0Cybin> dhclient only worked temporarly.
[04:36] <MartynKeigher> psusi, ....going through this.... http://wiki.manageditby.us/2013/08/10/dashing-upstart-script/
[04:36] <ubuntuaddicted> Beldar, i just want something really simple to be able to start steam and start a game, that's all I want another DE for.
[04:36] <MartynKeigher> done it several times in the past but just not working for me now
[04:36] <Beldar> ubuntuaddicted, Cool, you could try lubuntu, install via the terminal and copy and paste the apps installed to a text before hitting the yes to install. THen when you want in gone just use that list to remove.
[04:36] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, yea... it doesn't show by default unless you name it or use -a, since it isn't configured... at work you should pick a static IP address and will need to set the IP address, netmask, gateway in /etc/network/interfaces, and the dns servers in /etc/resolve.conf
[04:36] <Psil0Cybin> okay I am inside /etc/network/interfaces and it only says auto lo iface lo inet loopback and that is it
[04:36] <Psil0Cybin> nothing about eth0.
[04:37] <ubuntuaddicted> Beldar, so sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop OR just sudo apt-get install lxde?
[04:37] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, yea, you will need to add a stanza for eth0
[04:37] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: i am at work now, i never left...would you be able to help me configure it now?
[04:37] <Beldar> ubuntuaddicted, Either will work I believe, depending on which you want.
[04:37] <MartynKeigher> you dont ask for much do ya Psil0Cybin ???
[04:37] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, wow... long day.. have you an IP addy assigned for it?
[04:38] <iworkfromhomeinm> Would you like to stay home and spend more time with your family in 2014?
[04:38] <iworkfromhomeinm> Need to pay off some of your Bills ? Or just need extra money?
[04:38] <iworkfromhomeinm> I have been with this great company for 2 years now and the pay is great!
[04:38] <iworkfromhomeinm> This is so easy and simple all you need is a computer and internet
[04:38] <iworkfromhomeinm> http://www.znzadteam.com/user/imakemoneyinmypjs/
[04:38] <FloodBot1> iworkfromhomeinm: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[04:38] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: you do not even know aha :P the half of my day lol! but i do not have an IP Addy assigned for it, usually when you connect any eth0 at work you just get a dynamic ip or static i am unsure, atm...usually it never changes
[04:38] <ubuntuaddicted> Beldar, as I said I want the least amount of extra installed, i only want a simple DE to start steam and then a game.
[04:38] <Psil0Cybin> like the raspberry pi i have hooked up is 192.168.2.15 for days
[04:38] <Fou> has any one installed owncloud before on ubuntu?
[04:38] <ubuntuaddicted> Beldar, so probably lxde then
[04:39] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: but do i need to do dhclient eth0
[04:39] <Psil0Cybin> everytime i restart?
[04:39] <glitsj16> MartynKeigher: you can run an upstart check on the thin.conf by using "init-checkconf -f /path/to/thin.conf", but you need to do that prior to installing it in /etc/init/ and without sudo .. kind of an upstart parse check
[04:39] <Beldar> ubuntuaddicted, Sure both are light than xfce basically.
[04:39] <Beldar> lighter*
[04:39] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, generally you manually assign a static IP address for servers so they don't move around
[04:40] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: okay so should I wait till tomorrow get admin info from my boss for the router? set up a static IP and come back here and get you guys to help me?
[04:40] <MartynKeigher> thanks you glitsj16!!
[04:40] <Psil0Cybin> or could I get away with any ip for just today so I can update the system and go home?
[04:40] <MartynKeigher> will do it now
[04:41] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, man interfaces describes how to set up that file... there is no technical reason you *can't* just use dhcp, it's just usually easier to pick a static address so you can set up your firewall to forward ports and such
[04:41] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: i am not configuring nginx today, I just want to update the system and have internet working for tmwro.
[04:41] <MartynKeigher> glitsj16, .... came back with: Failed to ask upstart to check conf file
[04:41] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, if you follow the example in man interfaces, it should be fairly simple to set it up for dhcp and then you just need to reboot or run ifup eth0, and it should come up just fine
[04:42] <Beldar> ubuntuaddicted, Keep this sight available in the playing around section, left panel, are lists of the whole desktop packages for various de's and releases for adding and removing. http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/
[04:42] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: okay, so technically I need to go to that interfaces document and add mapping eth0,etc and it should work?
[04:42] <glitsj16> MartynKeigher: how did you run it exactly? and did you take it out of /etc/init?
=== dziegler_off is now known as dziegler
[04:42] <Psil0Cybin> or it gets more complucated and i need to read the whole manpage.
[04:42] <MartynKeigher> i typed the command just as u had it worte out and i did remove thin.conf from /etc/init before i ran it
[04:43] <MartynKeigher> and not as Root
[04:43] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, yep, you just need an eth0 stanza in the interfaces file and if you set it to dhcp, a reboot or ifup eth0 should grab an address and work
[04:43] <Psil0Cybin> alright haha ill try and do it now alone, and see what happens.
[04:44] <Psil0Cybin> could I just add into the interfaces file
[04:44] <glitsj16> MartynKeigher: try without the -f switch maybe, the upstart cookbook doesn't mention that, the man for init-checkconf does ...
[04:44] <Psil0Cybin> auto eth0 iface eth0 inet loopback?
[04:44] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: ?
[04:44] <glitsj16> MartynKeigher: i was looking at http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#init-checkconf
[04:44] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, but for a server so that you can set up the firewall to forward ports, you want a static IP... either manually configured in /etc/network/interfaces, or you can configure your DHCP server to map a static address to the servers' MAC address
[04:45] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: so whaqt would be the command i would type in /etc/network/interfaces?
[04:45] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, no loopback
[04:45] <Psil0Cybin> just looking at the manpage I cannotfigure out what command, to corrolate to what you are saying ha
[04:45] <Psil0Cybin> okay no loopback
[04:45] <rww> Psil0Cybin: auto eth0, then iface eth0 inet dhcp
[04:46] <kevin_> necesito instalar, personalizar y configurar el kernel de linux en xubuntu!! ayuda???

[04:49] <Psil0Cybin> it says
[04:50] <Psil0Cybin> the eth0 light in the back is red though..
[04:50] <Psil0Cybin> okay it booted in, but no internet.
[04:51] <Psil0Cybin> ifconfig states eth0 is up but RX packets: 2
[04:51] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, and it has an IP address?
[04:51] <Psil0Cybin> no ipl
[04:52] <Psil0Cybin> maybe it could be because i am using IPv4?
=== dziegler is now known as dziegler_off
[04:52] <Psil0Cybin> becasue i only see inet6 addr: fe80::96de
[04:52] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, are you sure you have it plugged into a router that supports DHCP?
[04:52] <rww> having an fe80:: IPv6 address is normal
[04:53] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: i am unsure, but i know that when ever anyone works anyone that plugs the etho wire into the computer, gets internet right away, no delay...nothing.
[04:53] <systemfish> hi, looking for a substitute to android. Even though I disabled synchronization, every "upload this and that" and anything remotely related.. my photos were uploaded to google's server exactly when I activated its "app store". I heard that there's something called ubuntu phone, no?
[04:53] <Psil0Cybin> I tried it on my laptop thosands of times just now and the wire works fine
[04:53] <Psil0Cybin> with fast internet speeds, it is just odd for this server.
[04:54] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, so sudo ifconfig eth0 shows no inet address?  try sudo ifup eth0?  and if that doesn't work, sudo ethclient eth0
[04:55] <Psil0Cybin> sudo ifup eth0 says ifup interface eth0 already configured

[05:04] <psusi> psusi, no, this is just a silly configuration problem
[05:04] <Psil0Cybin> no :(
[05:04] <Psil0Cybin> no inet address.
[05:04] <Psil0Cybin> only inet under lo

[05:04] <|jemc|> hey folks, I have an external usb apple keyboard that maps the F1-12 keys to "media" keys (XF86Whatever) unless I am holding the Fn button, at which point they become F1-12 as God intended.

[05:08] <Psil0Cybin> did the dhclient, again worked successfully....did ifconfig, No ip.
[05:08] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, what's ifconfig eth0 show now?
[05:09] <Psil0Cybin> I think almost the same thing just RX packets 10, and TX packets dropped : 106 now.
[05:09] <Psil0Cybin> could it be the inet6 addr?
[05:09] <Psil0Cybin> it would show the working inet addr as well?
[05:10] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, ip6 always assigns a link local address... you want an inet ( ip4 ) address
[05:10] <Beldar> systemfish, #ubuntu-touch
[05:10] <psusi> psusi, I thought earlier dhclient got an IP address?
[05:10] <Psil0Cybin> yea i am aware psusi i am just confused why it wont assign me an ip...when this works on everything else.
[05:10] <Psil0Cybin> no i never got an ip from dhclient
[05:10] <Psil0Cybin> my problem has been this eth0 card the whole time, or some driver is iffy
[05:11] <dogmover> a $15 ethernet card from walmart would go a long way toward troubleshooting this right now...
[05:11] <Psil0Cybin> well
[05:11] <Psil0Cybin> i already got a 15$ ethernet card
[05:11] <psusi> I don't think it's a driver problem... I think it's a your router is being stupid problem...
[05:11] <dogmover> or one from another machine
[05:11] <Psil0Cybin> when they built this machine 2 days ago, so.... i do not think this will solve the issue.
[05:12] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: really my router?
[05:12] <Psil0Cybin> but how come every other machine works? even my other linux box's, windows, mac
[05:12] <DF3D2> having a video pixelation problem with VLC.......cant seem to fix it
[05:12] <Psil0Cybin> eith the same eth0 wire :S
[05:12] <dogmover> if you take that cable  and put it in another macine and reboot it, does it get an ip?
[05:12] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, I'd pick and assign a static IP address
[05:12] <Psil0Cybin> psusi: alright, how can I attempt to go about this?
[05:12] <Psil0Cybin> do I need my router details?
[05:13] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, yea
[05:13] <Psil0Cybin> okay, so i might need to wait for that tmwro my boss is out of the office..anything else i can attempt to troubleshoot this right now before I leave?
[05:13] <Psil0Cybin> dogmover: yes if i put it in another machine it does.
[05:13] <Psil0Cybin> it seems like it is this specific machine, that is not connecting to the internet or .... is misconfigured
[05:13] <Psil0Cybin> or the driver.
[05:13] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, I'd say call it a night... I'm about to since it's after midnight
[05:13] <dogmover> get the gateway address and ip from another machine - turn that machine off - use it on this one
[05:13] <Psil0Cybin> yea, i guess that is what i might do.
[05:14] <Psil0Cybin> i could do that now tho dogmover .
[05:14] <Psil0Cybin> should i try that before I leave?
[05:14] <dogmover> it's your day, brother ;)
[05:14] <Psil0Cybin> okay you know what
[05:14] <Psil0Cybin> i might call it a night
[05:14] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, you might get on another linux machine on the network and use ping6 to ping the ip6 address that it is auto configuring and make sure that works... if it does, the hardware is fine
[05:14] <Psil0Cybin> hmmm
[05:15] <Psil0Cybin> i am on another machine right now linux machine
[05:15] <Psil0Cybin> how would I use ping6, in order to check...I think i always had problems with IPv6 though everywhere i went
[05:15] <Psil0Cybin> so I assumed, maybe this place has IPv4...thus that might be causing the issue
[05:16] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, sudo ping6 -I eth0 ip:addr:of:the:server
[05:16] <dogmover> I would almost bet you my car you are using IPv4 only
[05:16] <Psil0Cybin> because restarting the machine hangs on waiting for network config and than waiting up to 60 more seocnds for network conf
[05:16] <Psil0Cybin> probably. dogmover
[05:16] <Psil0Cybin> that would make sense.
[05:16] <psusi> dogmover, ip6 always auto configures a link local address... something seems to be screwing up the ip4 configuration, so an IP 6 ping would at least make sure the hardware works fine without the need for a proper ip4 config
[05:17] <dogmover> try the ping like psusi said - that would be instructive
[05:18] <dogmover> psusi: i agree completely
[05:22] <truba> I have installed lxde using sudo apt-get install lxde
[05:22] <truba> its working quite ohk for now
[05:23] <Psil0Cybin> alright
[05:23] <Psil0Cybin> no luck, cannot figure it out the ip to default gateway pinging 192.168.1.1
[05:23] <Psil0Cybin> does not work with that command you said
[05:23] <Psil0Cybin> keep getting unknown host but the internet works through the ethernet
[05:24] <Psil0Cybin> <psusi> should I just call it a night? since it seems like it cannot be fixed atm?
[05:24] <Psil0Cybin> and you are hitting the hay shortly, without you i would be lost.
[05:24] <Psil0Cybin> aha
[05:25] <steven__> Arch > Ubuntu
[05:25] <steven__> trololololol!
[05:25] <psusi> Psil0Cybin, that is an IP4 address, you need to use the ip6 address
[05:25] <Psil0Cybin> can I not get an ip to work through IP4, I do not think IPv6 ever works for me...
[05:25] <Psil0Cybin> I have it disabled on my XSubuntu machine
[05:26] <Psil0Cybin> Xubuntu*
[05:26] <Psil0Cybin> how do i find out my ipv6 ip once I connect the wire ? through the Connection Information on XUbuntu?
[05:27] <dogmover> ifconfig
[05:28] <Fou> has anyone install and configured owncloud corectly ?

[05:28] <hipitihop> I get constant trace in my dmesg like "[16875.663868] input input12: event field not found" how can I found out what is causing this and supress it as it fills up my dmesg making | tail useless
[05:28] <Psil0Cybin> when i connect the wire
[05:28] <Psil0Cybin> i only get IPv6

[05:29] <Psil0Cybin> k one second
[05:29] <Psil0Cybin> look at this pastebin
[05:29] <Psil0Cybin> this is ifconfig with the wire in, my other machine. http://paste.ubuntu.com/6713123/
[05:30] <Psil0Cybin> sory guys got disconnected
[05:30] <Psil0Cybin> this is ifconfig with the wire in, my other machine. http://paste.ubuntu.com/6713123/
[05:30] <Fou> im not asking for there opion im asking has anyone set that up because i need help
[05:31] <Psil0Cybin> dogmover: does that explain anything?
[05:31] <Psil0Cybin> could I made that one my static IP?
[05:31] <Psil0Cybin> 10.244.11.100 ?
[05:32] <dogmover> yes - if you turn it off - but it would be better to think of an address not being used.
[05:32] <dogmover> how many machines are there?
[05:33] <Psil0Cybin> 3
[05:33] <smacktalk1> is there a vmware powercli equivalent for ubuntu?
[05:33] <dogmover> try 10.244.11.137 - I'm just guessing it is not being used
[05:33] <dogmover> do you know the gateway?
[05:33] <Psil0Cybin> okay, so how can I set that as a staatic ip?
[05:33] <Psil0Cybin> it said default route
[05:33] <Psil0Cybin> 10.244.11.1
[05:34] <Psil0Cybin> and primary dns are the same
[05:34] <dogmover> Psil0Cybin: look at this  - http://www.howtoforge.com/linux-basics-set-a-static-ip-on-ubuntu
[05:34] <Psil0Cybin> but when I enter that address in my internet bar
[05:34] <Psil0Cybin> i get nothing only from 192.168.1.1
[05:34] <dogmover> dns won't matter since you are only using ip
[05:35] <dogmover> you get nothing because there is no web service at that iip
[05:35] <dogmover> ip, rather
[05:35] <dogmover> so you have your gateway, 10.244.11.1, and an IP address - try putting them in.
[05:36] <Daemoen> is it possible to tell preseed that you want to manually partition ?
[05:36] <Psil0Cybin> i tried setting inet dynamic
[05:36] <Psil0Cybin> for eth0 and i am getting fails by virtual network devices
[05:36] <Psil0Cybin> and configure network devices
[05:37] <Psil0Cybin> i am going to have to undo that...
[05:37] <Psil0Cybin> i do not think anything will work the way this is going...wth
[05:37] <Fou> well my issue right now is that ii have installed owncloud but i can not externaly access it and when i port forward to the ip  for the server i only get the apache2 page. I need to move the owncloud on that directory or change the settings for it
[05:37] <Psil0Cybin> Fou:
[05:38] <Psil0Cybin> is your own cloud in /usr/share/nginx/www ?
[05:38] <Psil0Cybin> I use Nginx, I do not like Apache.
[05:38] <Fou> well in the guys thatat ws there they used apache
[05:39] <Vp7_> not able to install ubuntu sdk in Ubuntu 12.04.. I would like to develop applications for Ubuntu moblie.
[05:39] <Fou> i would think it would be in the /var/www directory
[05:40] <Psil0Cybin> what was the other command for
[05:40] <Psil0Cybin> blah the eth0 before i changed it to dynamic
[05:40] <Psil0Cybin> dh something
[05:45] <Fou> thats where the apachie is but he directory for the cloud is is /var/www/owncloud
[05:48] <zammit> question: do I have to have a graphics card to install fglrx? i'm attempting to build a deb that (i think) requires some headers. this is on an ubuntu server, so CLI only.
[05:49] <zammit> hey channel log, my connection was reset minutes ago, and i already came back, thx :S
[05:53] <Psil0Cybin> I set up a static IP address, but still no luck getting any internet...
[05:53] <Psil0Cybin> i added in all the ip mask and gateway, still nadda....hmmm
[05:54] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, can you ping the gateway?
[05:54] <Psil0Cybin> pinging buytget Destination Host unreachable.
[05:54] <Psil0Cybin> maybe i have the wrong gateway but that was what was listed when i pluged the eth0 into another computer
[05:54] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, did you ping the IP or hostname?
[05:55] <Psil0Cybin> K
[05:55] <Psil0Cybin> pinging my IP
[05:55] <Psil0Cybin> works
[05:55] <Psil0Cybin> but i cannot ping anything else.
[05:55] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[05:55] <Psil0Cybin> if I ping 10.244.11.100, it pings my machine, but i seem to not have internet :(
[05:55] <Psil0Cybin> but the gateway does not ping.
[05:55] <Psil0Cybin> maybe its my router?
[05:56] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, please pastebin the output of `route`
[05:56] <truba> guys what should be the average cpu temperature in ubuntu running i3 processor which firefox open  ?
[05:57] <Psil0Cybin> http://paste.ubuntu.com/6713202/
[05:57] <Psil0Cybin> sorry it is not formatted zammit typing it by hand
[05:57] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, don't worry about format, i'll read it
[05:57] <Psil0Cybin> i was not able to get dhcp working
[05:57] <Psil0Cybin> with the eth0 cable, so at least now with a static ip
[05:57] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, please pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces
[05:57] <Psil0Cybin> it assigned me something
[05:58] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, with a static IP, it shouldn't assign you anything.

[05:59] <Psil0Cybin> well not assigned but before dhcp was not able to even get an IP
=== sysadmin is now known as VlanX
[05:59] <Psil0Cybin> so finally i have one with a static, but no internet :S
[05:59] <Psil0Cybin> i can ping my self, so that is fine
[05:59] <Psil0Cybin> but i cannot ping the default gateway or anything
[05:59] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, hmm maybe i'm not reading this right, but your route suggests an interface called "ETHO" - with a cap "o" not a zero.
[06:00] <Psil0Cybin> no no its a 0
[06:00] <Psil0Cybin> my bad
[06:00] <Psil0Cybin> seems like maybe my gateway is wrong or something
[06:00] <Psil0Cybin> or would i not be able to ping my self?
[06:00] <stoyansbg> Psil0Cybin, try running "ethtool eth0"
[06:00] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, do you have any other hosts on the 10.244.11.0/16 network?
[06:01] <Psil0Cybin> not at the moment
[06:01] <Psil0Cybin> from what i know
[06:01] <Psil0Cybin> just my laptop on wifi
[06:01] <Psil0Cybin> but on a diff ip.
[06:01] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[06:01] <Psil0Cybin> ethtool not installed
[06:01] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, what's the IP of the wifi laptop?
[06:01] <Psil0Cybin> 192.168.1.178 but it is on Wifi
[06:01] <Psil0Cybin> the eth0 uses a different IP set.
[06:02] <Psil0Cybin> one second
[06:02] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, but you said you could ping the laptop?
[06:02] <Psil0Cybin> no no not ping the laptop
[06:02] <Psil0Cybin> ping my own desktop
[06:02] <Psil0Cybin> one second let me try something here.
[06:02] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, so you can ping the loopback?
[06:02] <zammit> well that's a start...
[06:03] <thom_r> hello all
[06:05] <sonictwin> I'm trying to use grdesktop to connect to a win7 machine running tightVNC, is this possible?
=== Thor|Away is now known as Thorium220
[06:10] <Psil0Cybin> no luck
[06:10] <Psil0Cybin> plugged it into another router
[06:10] <Psil0Cybin> oin the office, got a green light from the eth0 wire but no internet, could not ping
[06:10] <Psil0Cybin> perhaps it was because it was still set on dhcp? maybe static with a diff config
[06:10] <Psil0Cybin> like is the green ligt in the back a good sign?
[06:10] <Beldar> truba, No real answer different computers and hardware will not be the same, to many variables, to answer.
[06:11] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, please pastebin the result of `ifconfig eth0`
[06:11] <Psil0Cybin> ifconfig eth0 shows everything just no inet address.
[06:11] <Beldar> truba, I would look up max temps for your computer
[06:11] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, did you try a `sudo service networking restart` ?
[06:12] <Psil0Cybin> no i restarted the whole machine each time
[06:12] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, assuming you're on a version that supports `service`... no idea when that came to fruition.
[06:12] <Psil0Cybin> on one router, the lught grows green in the back
[06:12] <Psil0Cybin> but on the main router, that works with the eth0 on my laptop
[06:12] <Psil0Cybin> it glows red
[06:12] <Psil0Cybin> both do not give an ip :S
[06:12] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, well it cannot be a problem with anything except for the specific machine b/c the inet addr is not populated
[06:13] <Psil0Cybin> i know
[06:13] <Psil0Cybin> it is wierd tho
[06:13] <Psil0Cybin> perhaps i need to get it to work as a static ip only?
[06:13] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, yes, static IP first.
[06:13] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, but that is what you pastebinned?
[06:14] <Psil0Cybin> i cannot pastebin becasue this machine, has no internet...i have to type it all out by hand and it gets messy
[06:15] <Psil0Cybin> one second
[06:15] <Psil0Cybin> trying it on this machine, the light glows green
[06:15] <Psil0Cybin> going to try a static one second
[06:15] <Psil0Cybin> different router there are two maybe one was not forwarded properly
[06:15] <Psil0Cybin> for the server

[06:17] <truba> Psil0Cybin: what is your problem actually ?? I m a networking guy actually
[06:17] <Psil0Cybin> i put in the static ip, the light glows green in the back but now, when i ping i cannot get it to ping anything
[06:18] <Psil0Cybin> truba: i am installing ubuntu server, i had a lazy eth0 card...the problem is the eth0 wire i am using on other laptops gives every computer an ip and works fine, but with this specific server...
[06:18] <Psil0Cybin> i cannot get the internet working or anything for that matter, when it comes to a connection
[06:18] <Psil0Cybin> I just tried a static ip, but still cannot ping google.
[06:18] <delt> hello
[06:18] <delt> so besides the lowlatency kernel and extra software pre-installed, what are the differences between xubuntu and ubuntu-studio?
[06:18] <Psil0Cybin> ifconfig states that i now have an ip finally, because i picked a static one
[06:18] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, please try to ping only IP addresses and not hostnames, no need to bring DNS into this.
[06:19] <Psil0Cybin> but i cannot accesss the internet :S even tho the light glows green in the back
[06:19]  * Beldar wishes people would stop holding the hand of this user, they have been on for two days, getting bat warnings continuously for flooding, and users asking them to tone down their attitude.
[06:19] <Psil0Cybin> i cannot even ping my gateway :S
[06:20] <truba> Psil0Cybin, check your arp table , do u get the mac address of your gateway ?
[06:20] <Psil0Cybin> how do i do that
[06:20] <Psil0Cybin> i am semi new to linux, but have figured out how to raid the system today sigh and other things
[06:20] <truba> just run arp
[06:21] <Psil0Cybin> arp nothing
[06:21] <Psil0Cybin> arp = gets nothing
[06:21] <Psil0Cybin> even if i set interfaces to dhcp
[06:21] <Psil0Cybin> i still get no ip, nothing
[06:21] <Psil0Cybin> even tho the light glows green in the eth0 card.
[06:22] <truba> Psil0Cybin run /proc/net/arp
[06:22] <truba> first ping your gateway and then run " cat /proc/net/arp "
[06:22] <Psil0Cybin> command not found
[06:22] <Psil0Cybin> pinging gateway
[06:22] <truba> what do u see ?
[06:22] <Psil0Cybin> Host unreachable
[06:22] <truba> now run the command
[06:23] <truba> do u see the mac address of your gateway ?
[06:23] <Psil0Cybin> IP address HW type Flags HW Address MASK Device
[06:23] <Psil0Cybin> all blank
[06:23] <Psil0Cybin> just says those words.
[06:24] <truba> so stop playing with IPs or at the layer 3 now , first get your layer 2 working
[06:24] <Psil0Cybin> truba: so what do i do? i am very lost atm
[06:25] <dogmover> truba:   he installed with no network available. I was going to suggest he try booting from the USB he installed with, now that he has a network cable plugged in, see if it brings the card up.
[06:25] <Psil0Cybin> but the usb i installed with is just the server USB
[06:25] <Psil0Cybin> I do not have a desktop iso handy
[06:26] <truba> do u see a card Psil0Cybin  run ifconfig
[06:26] <dogmover> but you booted with the usb to install - the software that is written to it is just called "live cd"
[06:26] <Psil0Cybin> ifconfig displays eth0
[06:26] <Psil0Cybin> and lo
[06:26] <dogmover> but do what truba said
[06:26] <Psil0Cybin> okay so what should i do next dogmover and truba ?
[06:27] <Psil0Cybin> ifconfig displays my eth0 card and something called lo
[06:27] <truba> pase the output of ifconfig to paste.ubuntu.coom
[06:27] <gdeeble> So i've run into a problem. I can't get suricata to remove from my installation since I don't use it. It keeps failing whether I try to remove it or re-install it to make sure it's got everything there. anyone have any tips to getting it removed?
[06:27] <Daemoen> when you do the server install, does it normally include the standard task selection no matter which boxes you choose ?
[06:27] <Psil0Cybin> truba
[06:28] <Psil0Cybin> how do i paste the output if i have no internet
[06:28] <Psil0Cybin> do i keep typing out the output each time
[06:28] <Daemoen> ( for the purpose of preseeding ).  I *only* select ssh-server, so not sure if i should include the standard task
[06:28] <truba> no its ohk.. do u see the static ip next to eth0 when u run ifconfig ?
[06:28] <Psil0Cybin> yes
[06:29] <Psil0Cybin> i see the static ip it just shows inet addr 192.168.1.128
[06:29] <Psil0Cybin> which is what i set it to.
[06:29] <truba> ohk
[06:29] <Psil0Cybin> so it shows up in ifconfig fine
[06:29] <Psil0Cybin> it jut doesnt actually get any packets...
[06:29] <truba> what does route -n say ?
[06:30] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, why did you set it to 192.168.1.128 when you're on a 10.244.11.0/16 ?
[06:30] <Psil0Cybin> http://paste.ubuntu.com/6713326/
[06:30] <Psil0Cybin> zammit: that was the router that gave me red light
[06:31] <Psil0Cybin> tried another router, gave me green light, different ip
[06:31] <Temper> i am trying to mount an NFS export but the mount command just hangs..
[06:31] <Beldar> gdeeble, sudo apt-get purge suricata
[06:31] <Psil0Cybin> truba: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6713326/
[06:31] <Psil0Cybin> although i put my gateway as 192.168.1.1
=== Mars is now known as Guest66584
[06:31] <Psil0Cybin> it shows up as 192.168.1.0 :S

[06:31] <Temper> RPC: AUTH_GSS upcall timed out. is in /var/log/syslog
[06:31] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, your gateway shows up correctly
[06:31] <IdleOne> Psil0Cybin: less ENTER more content. Not going to ask you again.
[06:32] <truba> this machine is connected to Cisco switch ?
[06:32] <Psil0Cybin> nope, just to a router.
[06:32] <truba> so it will never work
[06:32] <gdeeble> Beldar it says it's in a very bad state and have to reinstall but tried it and it fails.
[06:32] <Psil0Cybin> if my gateway shows up correctly, and the et0 wire works on every computer and every other machine gets internet, how can i solve this issue?
[06:32] <Temper> anyone know why mounting nfs would just hang?
[06:32] <Psil0Cybin> does this mean somewhere my computer is getting the information wrong?
[06:32] <truba> which router are you using ?
[06:32] <Psil0Cybin> or does it mean thatthe et0 card is broken
[06:33] <Beldar> gdeeble, I have never used it, do you have any held packages?
[06:33] <Psil0Cybin> the same router that works on every mac, linux, machine i tried.
[06:33] <Psil0Cybin> i used the same router on a raspberry pi and it worked
[06:33] <Psil0Cybin> fine
[06:33] <Psil0Cybin> seems like my more expensive machine does not wwant to work with the eth0
[06:33] <gdeeble> Beldar, i'm not the greatest with linux still, held packages?
[06:33] <Psil0Cybin> but a rasp pi can
[06:33] <Psil0Cybin> so i think all router settings are fine if my raspberry pi can get an ip from the eth0
[06:33] <Psil0Cybin> it just seems to be this server, I just paid 800$ for.
[06:34] <truba> Psil0Cybin: are u using a rollover cable to connect to the router or just the normal Lan cable ?
[06:34] <Psil0Cybin> normal lan cable
[06:34] <Beldar> gdeeble, If you run a apt update upgrade or the reload do you see held packages in the terminal?
[06:34] <truba> what is the company of the router ?
[06:34] <Psil0Cybin> truba: nothing crazy i sware, the same router worked on a raspberry pi....to demonstate nginx, and it worked fine. the company of the router is Tenda
[06:34] <Psil0Cybin> but i also just tried a linksys
[06:34] <Psil0Cybin> and nothing works
[06:34] <Psil0Cybin> but both routers work fine with my other PC and laptop
[06:35] <Psil0Cybin> linksys gives my eth0 card red light
[06:35] <Myrtti> Psil0Cybin: can you please, PLEASE use LESS enter
[06:35] <HDRDanny> ^
[06:35] <gdeeble> Beldar, no.
[06:35] <Psil0Cybin> the other wifi router, gives it a green light so i thought the green light might be a better way to finally get it working, so it might be a sign i am confused though why it works with everything else but not this one machine
[06:35] <gdeeble> Let me get a pastebin of what's going on.
[06:35] <Mace268> do i need to restart my de if xorg server was updated?
[06:36] <Psil0Cybin> k guys
[06:36] <Beldar> gdeeble, So you are getting some broken info from somewhere, can you give anymore specifics, if you do this reload of it or purge from the terminal?
[06:36] <Psil0Cybin> i am just going to call it a night
[06:36] <Psil0Cybin> i cannot do this anymore its been 12 hrs non stop and i cannot get anything working
[06:37] <Psil0Cybin> ill try again tomorrow guys
[06:37] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, i think you're making this more complex than it has to be, remove the variables, and take it one step at a time and most of all, calm down!
[06:37] <Beldar> gdeeble, YOu might just run both commands and pastebin all of the info.
[06:38] <Psil0Cybin> zammit: i have man, everyones telling me different steps and nothing works thats why im pannicking, i tried doing a simple dhcp that works on EVERY machine, that did not work....finally i got the eth0 to display but Now that i finally have a static IP
[06:38] <Psil0Cybin> that would not work
[06:38] <gdeeble> Beldar, http://pastebin.com/vk3z0XzH that's what it gives me when i run purge
[06:38] <Psil0Cybin> if i set the static ip on my xubuntu laptop and run the eth0 wire
[06:38] <Psil0Cybin> everything works
[06:38] <Psil0Cybin> i am actually so lost.
[06:38] <HDRDanny> Psil0Cybin, please stop using enter
[06:38] <HDRDanny> after
[06:38] <HDRDanny> every
[06:38] <HDRDanny> word?
[06:39] <gdeeble> Beldar, This started with me updating the server via CLI and it showed these items not being needed and i tried auto remove and started seeing these problems.
[06:39] <HDRDanny> Please? Collect your thoughts and put them in one or two strings, please.
[06:39] <Psil0Cybin> alright sorry I just need sometime out, and a night out for my self. Sorry for annoying everyone I will take a break tonight.
[06:39] <jeffrey_f> Psil0Cybin: what is the internal IP of the router and what is the IP assigned to your system
[06:39] <HDRDanny> You're not being annoying, it's just you're spamming up the chat.
[06:39] <Beldar> gdeeble, Is this a version of this app from the ubuntu repos or a ppa?
[06:39] <Psil0Cybin> default gateway = 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 address i am trying to setup : 192.168.1.128
[06:40] <Daemoen> Psil0Cybin: what is the problem youre dealing with ?
[06:40] <truba> PsilCybin : when u tested it in other machines, did u use the same calbe that u r using now ?
[06:40] <Psil0Cybin> yup
[06:40] <HDRDanny> Looks like he's trying to set a static IP.
[06:40] <Psil0Cybin> and it works
[06:40] <Psil0Cybin> truba: works on every other machine.
[06:40] <truba> Psil0Cybin : with the same cable rite ?
[06:40] <Psil0Cybin> yup
[06:40] <gdeeble> Beldar, Unsure. I didn't know it was installed, till it popped up. I am running ebox on the server and after reading it seemed like it might be tied to zentyal-ips, but I tried to reinstall and remove it and got no where there either.
[06:40] <Psil0Cybin> and even dhcp works on other machines, if i do not want to set a static.
[06:40] <jeffrey_f> Psil0Cybin: What is the IP to get to the router setup if you were to make any changes to the router (we're not, just asking)
[06:41] <Psil0Cybin> 192.168.1.1
[06:41] <Daemoen> Psil0Cybin: just for shits/grins, are you sure youre running a /24 cidr to begin with ?
[06:41] <truba> you are setting up everything, I think there is something wrong with your ethernet card..
[06:41] <Psil0Cybin> cidr?
[06:41] <Daemoen> id laugh if youre running say a /25 or /26 for instance
[06:41] <Psil0Cybin> truba....that is not good.
[06:41] <Psil0Cybin> at all.
[06:42] <zammit> Psil0Cybin, yea 255.255.255.0 = /24
[06:42] <truba> Psil0Cybin : can you run tcpdump ?
[06:42] <Daemoen> Psil0Cybin: when you use dhcp, are you getting back 255.255.255.0 ?
[06:42] <Daemoen> ( for your netmask )
[06:42] <Psil0Cybin> when i use dhcp
[06:42] <Beldar> gdeeble, what does this command give you. cat /etc/issue
[06:42] <Psil0Cybin> i get no IP at all.
=== apb__ is now known as apb1963
[06:42] <Psil0Cybin> dhcp gives me no ip.
[06:42] <gdeeble> Beldar:
[06:42] <gdeeble> Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS
[06:42] <zammit> ok, so nobody is going to answer my fglrx question? :( nobody is in the mood for display drivers tonight i guess!
[06:43] <gdeeble> Sorry about the double post
[06:43] <Daemoen> Psil0Cybin: ethtool eth0, are you seeing link established?
[06:43] <truba> zammit : I am facing a problem with graphics card
=== dziegler_off is now known as dziegler
[06:43] <Psil0Cybin> ethtool

[06:43] <Beldar> Daemoen, I can appreciate the theme of your posts however swearing is not allowed here.
[06:43] <truba> tcpdump must be installed
[06:43] <Psil0Cybin> tcpdump no suitable devices
[06:43] <Daemoen> Beldar: sorry, wouldnt have considered that swearing in most cases, okies though.
[06:43] <Psil0Cybin> do i run tcpdump eth0
[06:44] <Daemoen> Psil0Cybin: ifconfig
[06:44] <truba> yaa "sudo tcpdump eth0"
[06:44] <Psil0Cybin> tcpdump syntax error
[06:44] <Psil0Cybin> "sudo tcpdump eth0"
[06:44] <Daemoen> sudo tcpdump -i eth0
[06:44] <Daemoen> missing -i for interface
[06:44] <HDRDanny> We could start up #NaughtyUbuntu
[06:44] <HDRDanny> :D
[06:44] <Beldar> gdeeble, Not sure, that app is not installed in my desktop version of 12.04, looking at it makes me think you installed it. I would look up using force to remove.
[06:45] <pipolo> coucou
[06:45] <Daemoen> HDRDanny: umm..... yeah.... dont get me started on #badbuntu
[06:45] <Psil0Cybin> listening on eth0 link type en10mb ethernet capture size 65536 bytes

[06:45] <gdeeble> Beldar: I'm thinking it's part of the ebox-ips package that was installed.
[06:45] <Psil0Cybin> it shows i think UDP packets or something length 300
[06:45] <truba> ohk what else ?
[06:45] <yogui> bbbn,,vcx,,,njhgggggh
[06:45] <gdeeble> So force uninstall it?
[06:45] <Psil0Cybin> truba
[06:45] <Psil0Cybin> just keeps going down
[06:45] <Daemoen> Psil0Cybin: hang on, back up a bit.  en10mb... is this set to autonegotiate or specified duplex ?
[06:46] <Psil0Cybin> igmp query v2
[06:46] <Psil0Cybin> no clue
[06:46] <truba> Psil0Cybin just ping and open tcpdump in other terminal
[06:46] <yogui> noobee
[06:46] <Psil0Cybin> on another machine truba
[06:46] <Psil0Cybin> this is ubuntu server
[06:46] <somsip> yogui: do you have a support question?
[06:46] <Psil0Cybin> only 1 terminal
[06:46] <Beldar> gdeeble, Just a guess, I would look on the web, I have never had to do any force, but I see people using it.
[06:46] <Psil0Cybin> well ur dump said
[06:46] <Psil0Cybin> 25 packets captured 25 packets recieved by filter
[06:46] <Daemoen> Psil0Cybin: ctrl-alt-f*
[06:47] <truba> ohk so that means u r actually receiving some response from the router
[06:47] <Psil0Cybin> ctrl + alt + f
[06:47] <somsip> Psil0Cybin: you insist on ignoring polite request not to use enter. Any chance you could address your comments to people talking to you so others can see what is happening in channel?
[06:47] <Psil0Cybin> does not open anything
[06:47] <Psil0Cybin> k you know what im just going to call it a night, sorry guys i am just too annoyed atm.
[06:47] <Beldar> gdeeble, If it is not really more than an irritant, and does not leave you in a exposed state you might just not worry about it as well.
[06:47] <truba> now just check your routing table
[06:48] <Psil0Cybin> how would i do that truba? sorry i am very inexperienced.
[06:48] <gdeeble> Beldar: Reason I'm trying to fix it, is it seems to cause other packages to fail with the server.
[06:48] <Psil0Cybin> because pinging anything does not work, unless I ping my own machine.
[06:48] <Daemoen> Psil0Cybin: without knowing a lot more about whats going on, im just stabbing in the dark,  but sometimes, its best to step back and wait
[06:49] <Psil0Cybin> alright Daemoen
[06:49] <Beldar> gdeeble, Ah, bummer, well I have no real answer, also I have to take off for a short time is all, so hope you get this resolved.
[06:49] <Psil0Cybin> ill just call it a night and hopefully have a clear head tmwro
[06:49] <Psil0Cybin> do some googling i guess.
[06:49] <Psil0Cybin> thank you Daemoen, IdleOne, somsip, truba.
[06:49] <Psil0Cybin> have a good night all.
[06:50] <gdeeble> Beldar: Thank you for your help and time. Regardless of getting it fixed, it's nice to have someone try to help and point in a direction :)
[06:50] <truba> Psil0Cybin : just check your arp table once again
[06:50] <dsrtrck> hi
[06:50] <Psil0Cybin> sorry how do i check the arp table once again truba? before i shut off the machine
[06:50] <truba> cat /proc/net/arp
[06:51] <Psil0Cybin> empty :(
[06:51] <dogmover> Psil0Cybin: ping it from your laptop -it's on the same network isn't it?
[06:51] <Psil0Cybin> yes
[06:51] <Psil0Cybin> one second
[06:52] <Temper> does nfs still use portmap?
[06:52] <Psil0Cybin> wow host unreachable when i ping from my working laptop dogmover
[06:52] <Temper> i just tried to restart the portmap service and it says it is not installed
[06:52] <somsip> !info portmap | Temper
[06:52] <dogmover> ok, that's what I figured - nothing in your arp table still?
[06:53] <Psil0Cybin> nope dogmover sadly
=== dziegler is now known as dziegler_off
[06:53] <ubottu> Temper: Package portmap does not exist in saucy
[06:53] <somsip> !find portmap
[06:53] <ubottu> Found: rpcbind
[06:53] <HDRDanny> Forgot about the 10 min.
[06:53] <truba> Psil0Cygin u just said that internet is working on your other machines
[06:53] <dogmover> Psil0Cybin: just me talkin, but I would suggest a good nights sleep, and buy a $15 network card at Walmart on the way in tomorrow. Just for checking. You can return if if it doesn't work.
[06:53] <Temper> no in my nfs hosts.allow i have portmap: all
[06:53] <Psil0Cybin> truba: the internet is working i am talking to you guys but from my working laptop i cannot ping the machine that is not working
[06:53] <Temper> does that need to be rpcbind?
[06:53] <Psil0Cybin> dogmover: yea i guess i will have to try that with a networking card tomorrow
[06:54] <Psil0Cybin> i cannot ping the server from my laptop
[06:54] <somsip> Temper: looks like portmap is in the rpcbind package. If that's not installed, maybe that is your problem
[06:54] <dogmover> and i would still try booting from that usb - AFTER sleep ;)
[06:54] <Psil0Cybin> the only thing i can ping
[06:54] <Psil0Cybin> is from the server to the server
[06:54] <Psil0Cybin> or from my laptop to the global world.
[06:54] <truba> even I would suggest that u buy a new. but the tcpdump output shows that you are receiving some packets
[06:54] <dogmover> Especially since this was installed without a network being hooked up.
[06:54] <Psil0Cybin> truba like if i ping on the server, to the ip that the server is using ( if that makes sense)
[06:55] <Psil0Cybin> it pings it self.
[06:55] <Psil0Cybin> just cannot ping annnything else.
[06:55] <Temper> rpcbind is installed
[06:55] <dogmover> that means you stack is good - says not much about the card
[06:55] <Temper> i don't get it
[06:55] <Psil0Cybin> hmmmm wow od
[06:55] <dogmover> your, rather
[06:55] <Psil0Cybin> okay its 2 am, i worked for 12 hrs straight
[06:55] <Psil0Cybin> i need sleep sorry guys, for annoying everyone you guys actually ROCK!
[06:55] <truba> dogmover: what do you suggest ??   we can try one more thin, to statically configure the arp table as well
[06:55] <dogmover> Psil0Cybin: if you keep doing this, it won't be the last one ;)
[06:55] <Psil0Cybin> i will attempt a stab at this tomorow. ahhaa
[06:56] <Psil0Cybin> good night everyone thanks<3!
[06:56] <dogmover> arp table is just a reflection of what is going on with the network traffic
[06:56] <truba> yes that was a long shot, finding the mac address of the gateway.. neways I m struggling with my own problem
[06:57] <dogmover> truba: he started the day off with a fake raid, screwed aroudn with that for 8 or so hours, finally got some help here, now he has an install that works, but never had the network hooked up during all that
[06:58] <dogmover> truba: I am not sure his software is in good shape. Now that he has green lights on the card, if it were me, I would reinstall.
[06:58] <Temper> if i run mount on the local machine it says access denied..
[06:58] <Temper> mount 127.0.0.1:/test /testmnt
[06:58] <somsip> Temper: sorry. I tried to help but I am no NFS expert

=== graham is now known as Guest5552
[07:05] <truba> dogmover: can you tell me how to go about this problem. the problem is not cpu as much as the annoying noise the fan makes always.
[07:05] <hckr> I would like to know if I remove my harddisk from my computer, then link it to another computer, will ubuntu/grub work?
[07:05] <dogmover> truba: what kind of machine?
[07:05] <somsip> hckr: ubuntu is pretty good at things like that, but it isn't guaranteed to work at all
[07:05] <hckr> Currently,I have no graphic driver installed apart from the ones that comes with installation
[07:06] <truba> dogover: Dell inspiron 5420 , i3 processor
[07:07] <helen_> hello
[07:07] <truba> dogmover: at 50 C does the cpu fan have to run in full speed ?
[07:08] <helen_> hello
[07:08] <somsip> helen_: do you have a support question?
[07:08] <dogmover> truba: so when I got this one, the temps were up near 60. I had to get a new battery so I could update the bios. Then I read that the external power supply has caused some problems, so I switched that, no change. The updated bios dropped it below 50 -
[07:09] <truba> dogmover: how to update the bios ?
[07:09] <dogmover> truba: the darn processor was pegged - all the time  - - untl I did that. then I installed http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-linux-advanced-power-management.html - which you should read about - and that brougt it down a little more
[07:09] <dogmover> truba: you go to dell's site and see if there is a later one. download it and install it per their directions.
[07:10] <dogmover> truba: I had to write an msdos usb, then install it to that - some utiltiy from the internet - there's a bunch of those out there
[07:10] <truba> dogmover: so the problem is not with the fan.. the fan will be running when the temperature is at 50 C ?? I just need to figure out how to get the temperature below 50 C, Am I rite ?
[07:10] <helen_> hello
[07:11] <dogmover> truba: hard to tell, but that seems reasonable. hang on just a minute...
[07:11] <anadon> Q: what is the difference between Mir and early X in regards to function on a graphical system?
[07:11] <somsip> anadon: mir is not released yet, so you won't get an answer here
[07:11] <anadon> Fair enough
[07:12] <SSV> what is a non pae ubuntu setup
[07:12] <somsip> !pae | SSV
[07:13] <ubottu> SSV: To use more than ~3.2GB RAM on a 32bit system you can install the PAE-enabled kernel. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnablingPAE for more info
[07:13] <colinlee> hello,,anyone here??
[07:13] <truba> dogmovera: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6713431/  just check this which one is my cpu and what is the other thing.  I have nvidia graphics card installed
[07:13] <somsip> SSV: so non-PAE is one that doesn't use that
[07:13] <dogmover> truba: ok, so from what I see we are not alone, and dell has had some issues with their bios and the fan running all the time. You might want to check with their support. Was this machine running something else b4 ubuntu?

[07:14] <somsip> SSV: don't worry about PAE then, unless you plan to upgrade RAM in the future
[07:14] <dogmover> truba: makes sense - was it doing that when you had win 7?

[07:14] <holden87> Hi guys, i have a question. How stable is compton compositing? Is it okay to replace the default xfce compositing, because that one is causing screen tearing...
[07:14] <SSV> how do i get that
[07:15] <dogmover> truba: actually - did you have a monitor on it like you do now?
[07:15] <somsip> colinlee: well this is a specific support forum. Maybe #linux might be more suitable for you
[07:15] <somsip> SSV: what do you have now?
[07:15] <truba> dogmover: not at all.. what is annoying is cpu temp is fine.. cpu util is fine.. ram usage is fine   only thing is fan
[07:15] <dogmover> truba: so it didn't run all the time b4?
[07:16] <colinlee> i'm chinese where do you come from?

[07:18] <truba> dogmover: can you tell me which is the cpu and what is the other thing . I guess the other thing is GPU processor if I am not wrong
[07:20] <SSV> iam getting a boot error this kernel  requires the following features not present on the cpu pae unable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your cpu
[07:21] <somsip> SSV: reads like you installed a PAE kernel on a non-PAE CPU
[07:21] <Laric> how come the mainline ppa kernels (3.13-rc7 in this case) is compiled using gcc-4.6 and the saucy kernels are gcc-4.8? Can't use the mainline kernels with a nvidia driver then?
[07:21] <dogmover> truba: brb
[07:21] <SSV> somsip: where can i get a non-PAE
[07:22] <somsip> Laric: you would need to ask the PPA maintainers. We don't support PPAs in this channel (if I understand your question right)
[07:22] <Ben64> SSV: it'd help to explain what you're trying to do
[07:22] <somsip> SSV: have you upgraded the kernel? My understanding is a non-PAE kernel is installed by default
[07:23] <Ben64> somsip: actually, pae is default on most ubuntus now
[07:23] <Laric> somsip: well mainline ppa is ubuntu's own right? it is not a normal ppa
[07:24] <somsip> Ben64: ah. Then I understand wrong. Fair enough

[07:38] <truba> so my cpu temperature is even below 50 C at 45 C and 43 C . thats a good sign. but do I need the fan to run at this temp ??
[07:38] <Laric> at 45 and 43 you shouldnt need a fan running

[07:43] <dogmover> truba: i tried upgrading to prop drivers that were available in the distro - then the laptop refused to come back up after I closed it and opened it. Had to blow that away, re-install, and put the latest drivers from the mfr on - but what really did the trick was the bios update.
[07:44] <dogmover> truba: i have to go - good luck with that!
[07:44] <truba> dogmover: thanks for the help
[07:45] <dogmover> truba: oh, and just by the by - virtualbox on linux is GREAT for what you are proposing with your virtual machines
[07:45] <widdershins> apologies. Yes, iphone won't connect to ubuntu 13.10 due to being locked when it cannot be :P
[07:46] <truba> dogmover: b/w vmware and virtual box. What would u suggest ?
[07:46] <dogmover> truba: easy, quick, fairly straightforward - I have tried hyper-v, still working on open, but I have been using virtual box for a long time
[07:46] <truba> dogmover: have u tried qemu ?
[07:46] <dogmover> truba: vmware is fine too, if you have it. virtual box was free ;)
[07:46] <dogmover> truba: yes - and I like it, but vb was just quick and easy
[07:47] <dogmover> truba: still, i will pick up on qemu again when I have the time - just involved in some other stuff right now, and the other was in and done in no time
[07:48] <dogmover> truba: and time is the biggie right now. ltr ;)
[07:48] <truba> dogmover: ohk anyways , a last quesiton If I am not able to solve this fan prob.  should I ignore it .. because I am able to keep cpu freq, cpu utilization, ram consumption  , cpu temp low  ??
[07:49] <michael__> truba: What's the problem you're having?
[07:49] <truba> :michael__ I am using Dell 5420 inspiron : the prob. is my fan always runs
[07:50] <truba> which is very annoying even if the cpu temp is low

[07:58] <truba> Michael__
[07:59] <truba> I was using windows before , there I never had this problem
[08:00] <michael__> truba: Then it's an acpi issue in the linux kernel/config files
[08:01] <truba> Michael__ can you help me out please
[08:01] <michael__> truba: I'm doing a bit of google research on your issue
[08:01] <newleaves_jason> Hi
[08:02] <truba> Michalel__ I am using lxde + ubuntu 12.04,   I have managed to bring down cpu frequency, cpu temperature, utilization and RAM , the cpu tem is arnd 45 C but the fan running is really annoying
[08:02] <elementary-site1> any one know anything about gnu grub
[08:03] <somsip> elementary-site1: what's the real problem?
[08:03] <elementary-site1> i just installed the os and i get the gnu grub screen with bash-line commands
[08:03] <elementary-site1> i have no clue how to boot into the desktop
[08:04] <michael__> elementary-site1: Just wait
[08:04] <michael__> truba: What's the governor set as?
[08:04] <somsip> elementary-site1: is this ubuntu only machine, or does it have another OS too?
[08:04] <elementary-site1> ubuntu only
[08:04] <aeon-ltd> truba: if you're trying to reduce ram usage, i wouldn't unless you need to utilise for other purposes. 95% of the time unused ram is wasted ram. have you tried looking into fan controls?
[08:05] <somsip> elementary-site1: did installtion complete okay with no problems?
[08:05] <michael__> elementary-site1: It should autoboot the first entry after so many seconds, unless you pressed a key
[08:05] <truba> michael__ ondemand
[08:05] <elementary-site1> yes is did just when i reboot i get that screen
[08:05] <michael__> elementary-site1: If you don't intend to use anything else, you could set the timeout to 1
[08:06] <truba> aeon-ltd i need the RAM for virtualization , but even when i m not using anything the fan speed is high
[08:06] <michael__> I'm not sure whether grub allows 0 as a timeout
[08:06] <elementary-site1> how to i boot into the desktop
[08:06] <michael__> elementary-site1: what does the screen currently look like?
[08:07] <elementary-site1> just a black screen with
=== AndresSM is now known as AndresSM_away
[08:07] <truba> michael__ any solution ??

[08:07] <michael__> truba: Sorry, don't know whatto do
[08:07] <elementary-site1> bash-line commands
[08:08] <truba> michael__ no probs
[08:08] <michael__> elementary-site1: What ubuntu version?
[08:08] <elementary-site1> elemertary os
[08:09] <somsip> elementary-site1: it's not supported here. I think they have a channel at #elementary-os Check on their support webpage

[08:34] <ghostknife> I am looking for a way to get the number of packages available to update. /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check always returns a false value.
[08:38] <schultza> I have an ubuntu server isntalled in a vm with no GUI. How do I get the VM to stop blanking the screen (screensaver)?
[08:38] <kameeon> hi guys. is there a terminal command or anything for me to find out if my computer is up to running ubuntu. i have a 4 yr old fujitsu, with intel pentium dual core 2.1 ghz and an intel integrated card. and 4gb of ram
[08:39] <schultza> lsb_release -a
[08:39] <SwedeMike> schultza: http://nodsw.com/blog/leeland/2011/10/13-disable-blank-console-screens-ubuntu
[08:39] <schultza> SwedeMike: thanks.
[08:39] <schultza> kameeon: lsb_release -a
[08:39] <Beldar> kameeon, It is up to running ubuntu
[08:39] <SwedeMike> schultza: I came upon that page by doing googling <ubuntu console screen blank>
[08:40] <aeon-ltd> kameeon: it will run, but run unity well - probably not. though there are other *buntus with lighter DEs that may run smoother
[08:41] <schultza> kameeon: sorry. thought you were asking if it was already running ubuntu and what version.
[08:42] <kameeon> schultza, no, but thanks. So unity probably wont run smooth
[08:42] <kameeon> ?
[08:42] <kameeon> and its better if i use xubuntu or something of the sort?
[08:42] <Beldar> dual core and 4 gigs ram I don't see why unity would not run fine
[08:44] <schultza> Beldar: would lubuntu work on his system or will that also require video 3d accel?
[08:44] <Beldar> any canonical should run fine
[08:44] <aeon-ltd> intel integrated on a pentium
[08:45] <schultza> But does xubuntu and lubuntu not require 3d accel, right?
[08:45] <adac> ox
[08:45] <aeon-ltd> schultza: no not by default
[08:45] <schultza> ok. thanks.
[08:45] <aeon-ltd> schultza: if you have time you may aswell try ubuntu stock and see
[08:46] <schultza> aeon-ltd: I have to turn on 3d accel for stock Ubuntu.
[08:46] <schultza> otherwise it runs horribly slow on the gui.
[08:47] <Beldar> I have a slower dual core with 3 gigs ram and all desktops run fine, but I'm not a gamer. I think defining what the user actually wants might make this more accurate.
[08:48] <aeon-ltd> Beldar: are on intel integrated graphics?
