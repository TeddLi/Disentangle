<s> you ca n't cover every case just because someone does n't give more details . </s>

<s> <user> : like you said , probably a config problem . but just to make sure it is , that 's a quick and sloppy method to find out </s>
<s> which i do not recommend </s>
<s> <user> : i 've had very few problems with my .config files , maybe i 'm just lucky </s>
<s> <user> : there 's no need to reinstall anything if x loads and he can log in and everything . </s>

<s> compatability issue </s>
<s> so yes , re-install is about the only <unka-> of ensuring that 'out of the box' 'just works' </s>
<s> <user> : this is a user specific configuration issue . i am almost sure if he uses a different user the error wo n't popup again . </s>
<s> since that 's at least supposed to be <unka'> and working </s>

<s> <user> , easily tested . create a new user and see </s>
<s> <user> : yes that is my error , URL/http:/ URL/itsfoss.com/ <unk#a-./> </s>
<s> that 's why i recommended to move the configuration to another name </s>
<s> <user> : its not a bad suggestion , but its a rather drastic one </s>
<s> why drastic ? </s>
<s> because it removes all your configuration ? ( most of it anyways ) </s>
<s> you move your config dir into <unka.> . if it does n't work , you move it back and as if nothing happened </s>
<s> you're throwing out the baby with the <unka> </s>
<s> huh ? </s>
<s> if he 's made any changes </s>
<s> he loses the good ones with the bad ones </s>
<s> <user> : for a umask of 002 , a file with 664 is correct , because the exec bit is n't set by default </s>
<s> <user> : how to delete cache in my homedir </s>
<s> <user> : did you read what i suggested ? </s>
<s> and if he ca n't find the old config error , likelyhood is he wo n't know how to find the 'good' stuff </s>
<s> even if he keeps a backup </s>
<s> yes , you said to move to <unka.> and login again </s>
<s> <user> : correct , that 's 100% safe </s>
<s> <user> : safe , but still overly destructive , imho </s>
<s> for a new user at least </s>
<s> <user> : not destructive at all </s>
<s> <user> : good , can you press 'show <unka'> and tell us what it says ? </s>
<s> <user> : i only see it as non-destructive if you return <unka.> to .config , in which case the problem is back . </s>
<s> so i guess you know where the problem is or is n't at that point , but it does n't solve the problem . </s>
<s> <user> : exactly , and that is how i troubleshoot </s>
<s> <user> : once you know where the problem is , you get into more details </s>
<s> that 's how you pinpoint a problem </s>
<s> <user> : great , but that 's roundabout </s>
<s> you need details to find a problem </s>
<s> is the problem in the interior , the motor or the chassis ? </s>

<s> that is one way to find a detail , but a not very efficient way </s>
