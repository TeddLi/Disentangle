[01:42] <bimberi> Talldave2002: how did you install it?
[01:42] <Cedric77> seems like broken package or something i dont know
[01:42] <jobezone> gnomefreak: maybe he should use 'apt-setup' to get a fresh sources.list file. But I'm not sure if ubuntu likes it, or if it's a debian-specific tool.
[01:42] <Cedric77> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12956 i paste what i did there
[01:43] <der0b> lol...  ok.. i installed the last 2 linux gazette publications with apt..  how the hell do I read them???

[01:43] <jmg> der0b: you can check where they are by dpkg -L packagename
[01:43] <bimberi> daddius: yes - the panel applet usually changes on mine
[01:44] <kingspawn> Datatec: okay. have you tried setting your ip static in system->admin->networking?

[01:45] <gnomefreak> _jim_: no
[01:45] <jmg> sphex: does it need to be read by any other computers?
[01:45] <BockBilbo> hey
[01:45] <ironman> Hmm
[01:45] <sphex> jmg: nah
[01:45] <daddius> bimberi, sweet sweet
[01:45] <gnomefreak> _jim_: is it asking for cd?
[01:45] <jobezone> _jim_: the problem is that each line has a dot (.) which must be deleted, like 'deb http://.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy-updates main restricted'
[01:45] <_jim_> gnomefreak, yes

[01:46] <eneried> the first line sets the classpath, the second one launches the java app
[01:47] <polpak> sskroeder, no, but you can make that www_public directory a link to a directory in the chroot jail so apache has the right files, but the user still finds it in their home directory
[01:47] <gleesond> whats the default runlevel
[01:47] <gleesond> ?
[01:47] <kingspawn> Datatec: could you put the output on pastebin? need to see it
[01:47] <jmg> sphex: that would work too
[01:47] <_jim_> gnomefreak, jobezone guys removed the dots
[01:47] <Datatec> kingspawn: it will take some time to type, but I will do it
[01:47] <kingspawn> eneried: then you edit a file, type #!/bin/bash at the first line, then your commands, and save it.
[01:47] <_jim_> gnomefreak, jobezone install from cd or update ?
[01:47] <bimberi> BockBilbo: apt-get -d install <package>
[01:47] <gnomefreak> gleesond: what do you mean default run level?
[01:47] <kingspawn> Datatec: you can copy it with your mouse
[01:47] <BockBilbo> thanks bimberi
[01:47] <gnomefreak> update
[01:47] <kingspawn> Datatec: just hilight it, right click, and hit copy
[01:47] <gleesond> is it 3
[01:47] <gnomefreak> _jim_: update first
[01:47] <sskroeder> polpak, hmm ... ok....
[01:48] <BockBilbo> bimberi
[01:48] <BockBilbo> i guess it will work for
[01:48] <BockBilbo> dist-upgrade, righ?
[01:48] <_jim_> gnomefreak, jobezone its updating nice now
[01:48] <BockBilbo> apt-get -d dist-upgrade
[01:48] <vader> I am trying to use SVN and the funny thing is the system don't recognize the svn command, any suggestions?
[01:48] <jmg> sphex: tail packing has a significant performance impact
[01:48] <Datatec> kingspawn: that machine is not connecting to network, I guess I could copy to a disk and transfer it
[01:48] <gnomefreak> gleesond: there is no "default" run level type runlevel to know what your using
[01:48] <eneried> thanks, kingspawn
[01:48] <gleesond> in /etc there is a bunch of rc[1-6] .d
[01:48] <BockBilbo> so i get all the packages needed for the dist-upgrade, but doesnt install them?
[01:48] <gnomefreak> _jim_: good ;)
[01:48] <gleesond> that have the boot scripts
[01:48] <WS_> I'm having big issues trying to get apt-get to remove phpmyadmin, anyone care to assist? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12958

[01:48] <_jim_> :D
[01:48] <shinu> anyone using splashy here?
[01:48] <bimberi> BockBilbo: i've not tried but it should
[01:48] <_jim_> gnomefreak, jobezone install now the updates ?
[01:48] <BockBilbo> thank you so much
[01:48] <polpak> sskroeder, the exploit that was used in this previous incedent..  How old was the vulnerablity at that time?
[01:48] <kingspawn> Datatec: ah, of course, i forgot :/
[01:49] <shinu> ive got this weird problem and now at bootup and shutdown i just get a black screen
[01:49] <eneried> i have another question
[01:49] <jobezone> _jim_: yes, run 'sudo apt-get upgrade'
[01:49] <gnomefreak> gleesond: there is no such thing as a default run level it will use any from 2-6 iirc they are all multi person
[01:49] <_jim_> jobezone, upgrade or install ?
[01:49] <polpak> sskroeder, the reason I ask is properly configuring a chrooted environment, particuarly one with access to many outside services (mail, databases, etc), can be very difficult unless you're experienced with the process
[01:49] <jobezone> _jim_: or do it graphically, of course
[01:49] <gnomefreak> _jim_: upgrade
[01:50] <jobezone> _jim_: the graphical window you got does the same...
[01:50] <sphex> jmg: that box WILL BE slow no matter what. :p~
[01:50] <bimberi> Talldave2002: do you have another copy about that was installed using another method? otherwise try 'sudo apt-get remove --purge wine'
[01:50] <jmg> gnomefreak: for debian and derived distros the default runlevel is 2
[01:50] <sskroeder> polpak, i don't know -- i haven't been fully briefed yet - i started on the job just 2 weeks ago ...
[01:50] <eneried> i need to place an alias to a folder, imagin teh folder was /windows/disk1/folder and i need to make it works like /folder
[01:50] <_jim_> jobezone, ill do from terminal :-)
[01:50] <jobezone> _jim_: but maybe it's best to do it in the terminal, to see for errors
[01:50] <jmg> but redcrap and some others use runlevel 5
[01:50] <gnomefreak> jmp_me: its used 4 here without me changing anything
[01:50] <WS_> =(
[01:50] <bimberi> eneried: sudo ln -s /windows/disk1/folder /folder
[01:50] <_jim_> o that gonna take a little time
[01:50] <gleesond> gnomefreak: solaris is 3 and I thought that linux used a different numbering skeem
[01:50] <gnomefreak> iirc runlevel 6 is shutdown
[01:50] <jmg> sphex: might be better to use ext3 or even ext2
[01:51] <jmg> 6 is reboot iirc
[01:51] <eneried> thanks, bimberi
[01:51] <Talldave2002> bimberi seemi i have but cant find it
[01:51] <jmg> 0 is shutdown
[01:51] <gnomefreak> gleesond: your safe with 2
[01:51] <sskroeder> polpak, but i know that the servers hadn't been patched for quite a while (they were still using some  old version of apache - 1.3.27 i think)
[01:51] <jmg> maybe i got that backwards
[01:51] <bimberi> Talldave2002: 'which wine'
[01:51] <jmg> sphex: it could be the difference between slow and really fracking slow
[01:51] <gnomefreak> jmg: im fairly sure 6 is shutdown but now you got me thinking lol
[01:51] <osotogari> i am getting the following error when trying to unmount my ipod "eject: unable to eject, last error: Invalid argument" anyone got any ideas
[01:51] <gleesond> gnomefreak: I need to edit the rc*.d so my /etc/resolv.conf doesn't get overwritten every time I reboot
[01:51] <sphex> jmg: ok
[01:51] <_jim_> gnomefreak, jobezone it will take me about 20 - 30 minutes
[01:52] <eneried> bimberi, and you know if that solution was persistent? i mean when i reboot the machine the alias remains?
[01:52] <_jim_> gnomefreak, jobezone it will install automatically ?
[01:52] <gnomefreak> _jim_: thats fine someone will be here if we arnt

=== _harm is lookin for someone whom has talk and will test it w. me
[01:52] <sskroeder> polpak, i also think that i'll need to know more about chrooting  - the advantages and disadvantages before i choose that option ... - we do use php - we do use postgreSQL - our mail is located on another server - that also needs access to - and so forth ...
[01:52] <_harm> is some one old enough to rember talk? and if so wanne have a test session w. me?

[02:00] <ironman> or
[02:00] <ironman> Hmmm
[02:00] <polpak> d3wd, are you planning to dual boot, or just go whole hog?
[02:00] <ironman> good question
[02:00] <sskroeder> polpak, still - i need to have an overview over the advantages of having the chroot-jail in effect... and compare them to the added effort to keep things up-to-date ..
[02:00] <Xenguy> d3wd: installation has gotten much easier in any case - I say burn you own iso and go for it :-)
[02:00] <d3wd> polpak: That's what I thought.
[02:00] <d3wd> polpak: whole hog
[02:00] <ironman> there was 2 partitions in hdb, so doesn't that make sense?
[02:00] <d3wd> I already repartitioned the hard drive
[02:00] <bimberi> Talldave2002: yes a wine installed by a .deb is /usr/bin/wine (iirc) so it will be superceded by /usr/local/bin/wine
[02:00] <Xenguy> d3wd: even easier
[02:00] <kingspawn> ironman: yes..
[02:00] <polpak> sskroeder, keeping things up to date isn't the issue. it's the difficulty setting it up initially. You'll still be using the normal packages for the most part

[02:02] <jobezone> bpont: if you run amule as a user, it will have the same permissions as you do as a user. The best way for you to make amule write into some directory, is to change the permisions of that directory, so that you, and amule, can write into it. That, or you can run amule as root (using 'sudo amule') but that is not a good thing, don't do it!

[02:29] <lx45803> is there any way to partition my HD without my live cd or a burner?
[02:29] <jobezone> _jim_: ok, let's do something. Try to uninstall the package 'locales' by doing 'sudo apt-get remove locales' . But don't confirm it. Instead, copy the output of the packages it will want to remove, and paste them in that website.
=== Xenguy prefers his own solution ;-)
[02:29] <NickGarvey> thank you Xenguy and eggzeck (and yes I liked yours better too because I understood it ;))
[02:29] <Xenguy> heh
[02:30] <eggzeck> NickGarvey: s/// is a substitution
[02:30] <_jim_> jobezone,  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12962
[02:30] <NickGarvey> eggzeck: yup, thats all I understood though heh
[02:31] <jobezone> _jim_: ok, cool, them remove them away. It will also remove a bunch of others, but it's no problem, later you can install them again.
[02:31] <_jim_> jobezone, u sure ?
[02:32] <Xenguy> NickGarvey: eggzeck is using sed to replace 'everything' with 'nothing' (.* is a regular expression -- very useful once you get it)
[02:32] <_jim_> jobezone, how i can install them later if i always get an error while installing ?
[02:32] <jobezone> _jim_: after you remove them,
[02:32] <NickGarvey> Xenguy: ah, whats the . for?
[02:32] <eggzeck> NickGarvey: the . is a wildcard
[02:32] <jobezone> _jim_: you'll clean the package archive in your disk,
[02:32] <eggzeck> NickGarvey: matches any character except new line
[02:32] <NickGarvey> eggzeck: then whats *?
[02:33] <_jim_> jobezone, ok uninstalled
[02:33] <jobezone> _jim_: no error ?
[02:33] <_jim_> jobezone, nop
[02:33] <Xenguy> NickGarvey: man regex ('.' represents any character; '*' says "zero or more instances of .")
[02:33] <_jim_> jobezone, everything ok
[02:33] <eggzeck> NickGarvey: the * is a quantifier, it means "zero or more times" (anything before it)
[02:33] <NickGarvey> oh alrighty, thank you
[02:33] <NickGarvey> both of you ;)
[02:33] <jobezone> _jim_: if not, do 'sudo apt-get clean'.

[02:38] <odin> NickGarvey: or on this other page, it just gives me a grey box where the vid is suppose to be
[02:38] <crimsun> FearMoth: snd-intel8x0 is dmixed by default, so it supports multiple applications' sounds -- unless one of those is an oss-only app, like Flash or Skype
[02:38] <eobanb_> coir, i guess so, but the way file sharing works is one computer acts as the server, and the other acts as the client.

[02:55] <NickGarvey> benoy: and yes I have ;)

[02:55] <{anna}O> zero
[02:55] <benoy> I know, I am running ubuntu, but trying to help a friend with cygwin
[02:55] <mseney> Fensta: best way to do it if your bios lets you select which device to boot from. I have one IDE and one SATA and I can F9 and pick either to boot install XP or Ubuntu.
[02:55] <Aeudian> cliche, yea i know =/ but what makes osx run a game differnetly then linux?
[02:55] <jinho> why cant i join another server?

[02:55] <NickGarvey> benoy: what does he need?

[02:56] <d3wd> I tried booting the live cd, and it's doing the same thing the install cd did. says "no NTFS volumes found, exiting". And then it just goes to dr-dos, rather than doing anything like run ubuntu
[02:56] <Chris_Tucker> Xenguy, not quite, that just copies the original, without removing its new lines
[02:56] <jmg> {anna}O: type "sudo usermod zero -d /home/zero"
[02:56] <benoy> but whenever he connects, and opens the program, he gets an x windows error

[03:16] <jobezone> babelfishi: and did you try adding the module, using 'modprobe prism2_usb'

[03:18] <jobezone> babelfishi: yes, with a sudo. This will add that module, if it exists.

[03:19] <MrProper__> Xenguy, i was hoping to use the inbuilt --compare option to tar, but tar seems to ignore files that are not in the archive and doesnt seem to give an option to tell me that
[03:19] <benoy> when i type in "ssh -X username@serveraddress.edu" It asks for the password, which i enter correctly.  Then I get access to the school's server.  When I type in matlab, it gives me a textbased environment rather than a gui window but if I do the same steps on my ubuntu computer, I get a graphical interface which is what I need because I need to deal with graphs and other visual aids.
