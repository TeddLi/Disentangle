[20:57] <zeep> ChogyDan, The problem is that the depencency is with wine-desktop. I tried holding the package but it refuses to install without it :/
[20:57] <[dlp]> tgm4883: Only backports by the looks of things.
[20:57] <[dlp]> Thanks for that, anyway.
[20:57] <[dlp]> Hopefully this will solve ythe problem.

[21:05] <palomer> gordonjcp: X doesn't even come up anymore
[21:05] <betrayd> wait a sec
[21:05] <gordonjcp> palomer: if not, back up /home somewhere, reinstall *making sure you set up /home on a separate partition* and then copy it all back

[21:39] <bekks> transit441: sending HUP to a service just causes that message, a reload of the config, and the process starts again.
[21:40] <transit441> bekks: well /var/logs/openvpn shows: Options error: --server directive network/netmask combination is invalid
[21:40] <bekks> transit441: Thats an error, and the explanation is obvious.
[21:40] <transit441> bekks: openvpn.conf is server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
[21:40] <transit441> i see nothing wrong with those
[21:41] <bekks> transit441: a classical class A network has a /8 mask, not a /24.
[21:41] <bekks> transit441: Use some 192.168.x.y network instead, which is a class C and uses /24

[21:42] <transit441> should i use those 2 addresses instead?
[21:42] <transit441> i have no idea what you are referring to by /8 and /24 mask
[21:43] <bekks> transit441: /8 and /24 are the CIDR representations of 255.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.0

[22:42] <Bray90820> can empathy connect to irc
[22:44] <trism> pragmaticenigma: x11vnc shouldn't autostart by default, maybe you are bumping into vino? gsettings get org.gnome.Vino enabled;
[22:44] <trism> pragmaticenigma: though you could look through /etc/xdg/autostart/ and ~/.config/autostart/ to see if you dropped any files in there to start x11vnc

[23:02] <GunArm1> i'm having a CRAZY issue, where I have a mdadm array (md1) online and mounted and running, which is visible at /dev/md1, but all the drives that compose it (/dev/sdk sdl sdm according to /proc/mdstat) are not showing up in /dev/ I don't even know what to make of this...
[23:03] <GunArm1> I created the array while the server has been up, to copy files off of my failing other array, which has since died, so this array is the last backup of my files and I'm afraid to restart my machine if it's in some wierd state like this
[23:03] <beandog> that's odd
[23:03] <beandog> is your /dev properly populated?

[23:08] <GunArm1> beandog: they are not showing up in fdisk -l,  I do get errors because most of my stuff is GPT and fdisk doesn't support it, but it doesn't even give me those errors for these drives
[23:09] <Dr_Willis> Catilius:  and how is that related to Ubuntu support?
[23:09] <beandog> GunArm1: oh yah, gdisk then
[23:09] <roasted> hello
[23:09] <Catilius> but the more I read the more confused HELP, HELP teimbolee 99% Adris install.sh to install the ubuntu
[23:10] <roasted> I'm swapping out my HDD for an SSD. I ran rsync -avh on it to get the data on the SSD. Now I'm trying to install grub. i succeeded in doing so but when I boot up, the grub splash screen says could not mount blahblahblah. The UUID in the error is to my old HDD. I changed /etc/fstab to have the UUID's for my SSD partitions (swap, /, etc) but grub is still yielding the old UUID in the error. Any insight?
[23:10] <beandog> GunArm1: if mdstat says it's synced okay, then it should be fine on a reboot.
[23:10] <Dr_Willis> Catilius:  install what ubuntu? You just asked how to Install Slitaz on android/arm  - thats not ubuntu.
[23:10] <troulouliou_dev> hi how to create an accoutn for friends from gnome classic
[23:10] <beandog> GunArm1: mdadm will autobuild the array anyway by looking at the disk labels (raid autodetect)
[23:10] <beandog> GunArm1: I assume it's a raid1 mirror?
[23:11] <Dr_Willis> troulouliou_dev:  easy way 'sudo adduser billgates'   or whoever you want the username to be
[23:12] <troulouliou_dev> Dr_Willis, i mean a twitter or facebook account for friends (ex gwibbler)
[23:12] <GunArm1> gdisk doesn't seem to have a list option, you give it devices, but if the devices aren't showing up in /dev/ in the first place what do I do?

[23:12] <overedge> anyone knows how to connect to windows share server over xubuntu?
[23:13] <beandog> overedge: install gigolo and use that .. it's pretty dead simple

[23:13] <GunArm1> beandog: no its actually a terrible RAID 0 but its all I could make at the last minute to have the space to save my failing file system on the other array, have you ever HEARD of disks not showing up in /dev/?  isn't that really wierd and scary?
[23:13] <overedge> but every time i use gigo i get nothing
[23:14] <beandog> GunArm1: eh, it happens if you did something to /dev.  The physical devices are still there, though.  And the RAID's gonna setup just fine as long as it has device names.  The RAID metadata keeps track of what kind of a state it's in and what the array is like.  You can't just accidentally rebuild an array wrong.  You'd have to force it that way.
=== anon_ is now known as rcdn
[23:14] <beandog> GunArm1: meaning, rebuild it wrong w/mdadm
[23:14] <GunArm1> right
[23:15] <beandog> GunArm1: as to why your /dev is messed up ... what'd you do?  new kernel? killed udev?
[23:15] <beandog> something?
[23:15] <GunArm1> well, I did cat /dev/urandom to show my buddy something which messed up the text encoding on that terminal
[23:15] <GunArm1> and I probably ctrl-c'd it
[23:15] <beandog> GunArm1: okay
[23:15] <GunArm1> would that do it?
[23:15] <beandog> no
[23:15] <beandog> you'd have to run reset to get your terminal back though
[23:15] <Catilius> Dr_Willis I even where that is slitaz.img for arm
[23:15] <beandog> GunArm1: actually, no it could do it if it went for a while
[23:16] <MestreLion> Any clues on how to install libwxbase-2.8-dev?
[23:16] <beandog> maybe.
[23:16] <beandog> GunArm1: run dmesg, see if it threw a fit
[23:16] <Dr_Willis> Catilius:  I still dont get how Ubuntu figures into your  issue.
[23:16] <GunArm1> beandog: I never know how to interpret anything from dmsg
[23:16] <beandog> GunArm1: If your devices were there on this current bootup, then you're probably fine
[23:16] <GunArm1> but ill look
[23:16] <Dr_Willis> Catilius:  most likely you dd that img to a sd card or usb. and boot it on whatever arm device you have.
[23:16] <beandog> GunArm1: This is the thing ... I'd shut down the raid manually
[23:16] <beandog> so you know it's okay
[23:16] <Catilius> well as to establish a bte bboks not work

[23:17] <roasted> Question - I switched from a HDD to SSD by rsync -avh'ing the two drives. Now GRUB is still attached to my old HDD UUID. I need to update it with the SSD UUID, but you cannot edit grub.cfg (that's what it says anyway since that file is auto generated). How can I generate a new grub.cfg from within a LiveUSB environment?
[23:17] <beandog> roasted: grub-update
[23:18] <beandog> or is it update-grub
[23:18] <roasted> beandog: you mean update-grub? It says grub-probe error. cannot find a device for /. is /dev mounted?

[23:18] <yofun> Treaver:  can you use a usb keyboard?
[23:19] <Treaver> No
[23:19] <Dr_Willis> roasted:  boot a live cd and use the boot-repair tool. or edit the etc/default/grub file to correct the uuid, and check fstab also.. or use 'tune2fs' to set the UUID to be the same as it was on the other hd
[23:19] <Treaver> I don't have one
[23:19] <Catilius> Dr_Willis iso unzipped, well, do not run out, right now, to hell with it formatted, xs be, I want a small linux operating under the arm
[23:19] <roasted> beandog: no, I'm past that. Now I just need to generate a new grub.cfg, because in my grub.cfg the UUID is to the old HDD, but I'm already on the new SSD - I just cannot boot. :(
[23:19] <beandog> roasted: oh, do what Dr_Willis said.
[23:19] <yofun> Treaver:  this the first time useing ubuntu?

[23:38] <earl2> I am thinking I could add something like vnc to the init script. but I don't know muc habout screen sharing...
[23:39] <earl2> any ideas?
[23:39] <beandog> michael87: this is what *I* do.  Install 'pv' with apt-get, then run "pv -ptre /dev/dvd | dd of=dvd.iso"
[23:39] <whoever> formating , there a few fat32 hex codes , does it matter which one I use
[23:39] <Dr_Willis> earl2:  you want to use a ssh tunle if using vnc over the internet.
[23:40] <beandog> michael87: that doesn't deal with copy protection or anything, it just makes a straight copy of the disc image
[23:40] <Dr_Willis> earl2:  thheres freenx also. but  i tend to just use ssh to get into my remote machines

[23:40] <ubottu> VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[23:40] <earl2> Dr_Willis: ssh is OK I would just like the graphical interface please
[23:41] <Dr_Willis> earl2:  you will need to set up forwarding.
[23:41] <earl2> I see.
[23:41] <Dr_Willis> earl2:  any remote desktop may be very slow/sluggish. You can ssh in and just use X forwarding to forward a single app if needed
[23:42] <earl2> Dr_Willis: may be very slow/sluggish if I don't forward ports, you mean?
[23:42] <computer88> hello everyone
[23:42] <earl2> Dr_Willis: is what we're talking about rather difficult to set up or rather easy?

[23:44] <Dr_Willis> I am remoteing in from my android phone over 4g... so its not  the fastest way ;)
[23:44] <beandog> michael87: handbrake will make your baby go to sleep it is so awesome.
[23:44] <fellayaboy> freeze or doesnt even register at all
[23:44] <computer88> i was trying to install MS office 2010 using wine. running 64bit ubuntu v 13 on a newer dell pc. tried winecfg 32bit but that only helped a little. any help is appreciated
[23:44] <earl2> Dr_Willis: I'm actually OK with that....  I'd just like to see what it looks like and do som ethings graphically that are very hard for me to do at the prompt
[23:45] <earl2> Dr_Willis: I understand the 3 sec frustration
[23:45] <bray90820> linux cant be installed on a mac because linux has no smc control
[23:45] <earl2> Dr_Willis: So how would I go about setting this up?
[23:45] <subcool> Thanks Dr_Willis .. i like vnc4viewer, maybe the server will work out..
[23:45] <Dr_Willis> earl2:  ssh and x forwrding is trivial to get going.   for vnc and a ssh tunle - see the url the bot gave earlier
[23:45] <fellayaboy> how can i set up or edit connections via terminal?  i usually use gui of network manager but i dont have the machine locally
[23:46] <beandog> michael87: http://www.thepowerbase.com/2012/03/install-handbrake-in-ubuntu-12-04/
[23:46] <anonymous_> damn theres alot of peeps on here
[23:46] <michael87> beandog, I love handbrake swear by it. problem is that it is an encoding application and not a copy one. I'm running a laptop. Also I have I installed the free dvd reading sofware libdvdcss or something. And handbrake stops encoding before it can start with the movie
[23:46] <Dr_Willis> anonymous_:  actually its a slow day..
[23:46] <beandog> michael87: have you tried a recent snapshot?
[23:47] <computer88> wheres the best place to get help with wine . i think office errror is due to be new
[23:47] <compdoc> vnc4server is very reliable
[23:47] <earl2> Dr_Willis: how can I use ssh if I don't own a server though?  (just have the two computers at home)
[23:47] <beandog> michael87: Okay, if you're trying to install something manually, then yah, you'll need latest libdvdcss and libdvdread.
[23:47] <michael87> beandog,  no. I am running the latest one o.9.8
[23:47] <fellayaboy> earl2 any computer can be a server
[23:48] <Dr_Willis> earl2:  err., a linux machine is a server.. just install the ssh service
[23:48] <beandog> michael87: they only do releases like ... once a year ... grab a recent snapshot, and it might fix your problem
[23:48] <michael87> beandog, also I am on raring ringtail and I installed the one for precise until handbrake for raring is complete
[23:48] <fellayaboy> earl2 your phone can be a "server"
[23:48] <bray90820> Can someone confirm or deny that because linux doesn't have SMC control if you install it on a mac it will ruin the processor
[23:48] <beandog> michael87: oh look ... new release came out ... today :D
[23:48] <beandog> michael87: http://handbrake.fr/
[23:48] <Dr_Willis> bray90820:  lots of people use linux on apple hardware.
[23:49] <utfans05_2> bray90820 have you heard of macbuntu?
[23:49] <earl2> actually I just googled something.  what do you think about "teamviewer" for linux?
[23:49] <earl2> it would seem to fit the bill for what I'm doing...
[23:49] <computer88> any ideas on how to install office in wine?
[23:49] <Dr_Willis> earl2:  try it and you decide.
[23:49] <earl2> do you think I might hvae luck with it?
[23:49] <fellayaboy> earl2 just install openssh-server on the pc u wish to connect to..
[23:49] <Dr_Willis> computer88:  see the #winehq channel and the wine app database
[23:49] <bray90820> utfans05_2: isn't that just a theme
[23:49] <utfans05_2> i used teamviewer from my phone to access information on my desktop when i needed it, its not as fast as you may want but it does a decent job
[23:50] <utfans05_2> bray90820 i believe its a full distro
[23:50] <earl2> fellayaboy, is there any chance that I can't conect to it due to ports porblems?
[23:50] <fellayaboy> i changed from vnc to teamviewer
[23:50] <earl2> i'm not in charge of the router it's behind
[23:50] <fellayaboy> just works way better for me
[23:50] <computer88> whats the newbie channel called?
[23:50] <fellayaboy> which is a shame
[23:50] <Dr_Willis> last i looked 'macbuntu' was a very very badly done script..
[23:50] <earl2> if I go the openssh-server route will I defoinitely be able to connect to it?
[23:50] <beandog> computer88: search winehq.com too
[23:50] <Fatalnix> When is Ubuntu slammin salmon coming out again?!
[23:50] <bray90820> utfans05_2: Macbuntu is an open-source program, designed to transform Linuxs appearance and layout into a Mac OS X environment
[23:50] <Dr_Willis> earl2:  you can ssh into a pc... if you set it up right..
[23:50] <fellayaboy> earl2 u have to open port 22 on the "server" which is the pc u will connect to
[23:50] <Fatalnix> I can't wait!
[23:51] <michael87> beandog, cool. I'll give it a shot. crossing my fingers for an mpeg2 passthrough. Would help out a hell of alot in this case. Doubtful. If it fixes this at the very least I'll be happy. Don't want to go back to windows 7 on my laptop because my wine is being a pain in the but for almost all windows apps
[23:51] <fellayaboy> i mean to the server..from your router
[23:51] <Dr_Willis> earl2:  i ssh from my android poone to my home pc all the time
[23:51] <computer88> thanks bean
[23:51] <fellayaboy> as do i ..but i ssh through an iphone
[23:51] <beandog> michael87: well, there's *more* ways to get it off there ... but ... you'd have to compile stuff, I dunno how up to that you are.
[23:51] <utfans05_2> bray90820, im looking now,
[23:51] <Fatalnix> Dr_Willis: you should run sshd on it and activate gateway ports. Free proxy server anytime anywhere.
[23:51] <beandog> michael87: I'd try makemkv or handbrake first, obviously
[23:51] <Fatalnix> mobile proxy*
[23:52] <beandog> michael87: anyway, it's actually not that hard, just install the two libs and then build something manually.  Good luck bro, I gotta run.
[23:52] <michael87> beandog, I am a noob at building manually
[23:52] <Fatalnix> ok. enough friendly trolling
[23:52] <utfans05_2> bray90820,  if you properly setup your uefi on your mac there should be no issues with running linux on a mac
[23:53] <beandog> michael87: it's a good chance to start :)
[23:53] <fellayaboy> earl2 if your using ubuntu just open a terminal and type in sudo apt-get install openssh-server...once its installed all you have to do is go into your router settings and open port 22 for that machine
[23:53] <bray90820> utfans05_2: how would i do that
[23:53] <beandog> fellayaboy: doesn't it install by default?
[23:54] <utfans05_2> bray90820, i would have to do some research cause i have not done that myself but i know a few people with macbooks running different linux distros
[23:54] <earl2> okay thanks
[23:54] <earl2> I'm going to try something brb
[23:54] <fellayaboy> not from my experience beandog...but i could be wrong..i know i had to do that lots of times unless the new versions have been installing it by default
[23:54] <earl2> thanks for the help guys
[23:54] <bray90820> utfans05_2: but the guy is telling me after a wile the logic board goes bad
[23:54] <beandog> fellayaboy: oh oka
[23:55] <ThePiousPriest> hello all, how do I install flash on ubuntu?
[23:55] <utfans05_2> bray90820, what ever guy is telling you this is wrong lol
[23:56] <fellayaboy> usually i go to ubuntu software center and install a package called ubuntu restricted extras..and it will install a bunch of common stuff like flash java and other things to play mp3 and movies

[00:01] <wilee-nilee> michael87, YOur family thanjs you lol.
[00:01] <fellayaboy> whats the model?
[00:01] <ThePiousPriest> Belkin DB 750
[00:02] <fellayaboy> ok let me see brb
[00:02] <utfans05_2> bray90820, there are well established procedures for putting ubuntu for a mac, have you done any google searching to find some howto's or you just going from word or mouth for this guys?
[00:02] <michael87> the new handbrake did not get around the arccos protection  :(.
[00:02] <bray90820> i had ubuntu on there before
[00:03] <bray90820> i am just checking what this guy said
[00:04] <michael87> I'm going to learn how to compile makemkv. But damn I wish there was a simplier option. Dvdfab keeps crashing in wine and so many other people figure out how to get it to work frusterating
[00:04] <ThePiousPriest> I have returned
[00:04] <utfans05_2> bray90820, this dude didnt know what he was talking  about, its totally fine to throw ubuntu on  mac
[00:05] <bray90820> good
[00:05] <bray90820> thank you
[00:05] <bray90820> i kind assumed it was anyways
[00:05] <utfans05_2> bray90820, follow this how to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro
[00:05] <bray90820> :P i know how
[00:05] <bray90820> it was on there before :P
[00:05] <utfans05_2> bray90820, ok
[00:06] <bray90820> and i have been a linux user for about 10 years
[00:06] <bray90820> so i am all good
[00:07] <michael87> does anyone know how to either get around a dvd's arcos protection or how to freaken set up dvdfab under wine?
[00:07] <michael87> this is really really frusterating
[00:07] <fellayaboy> sorry thepiouspriest my internet is messing up
[00:08] <pragmaticenigma> michael87: You need to install the Ubuntu restricted extras.  This will not guarantee playback, as most of the "encryption" is done physically to the disk which makes it unplayable in linux
[00:09] <yofun> hey my sound icon in the top tray doesnt work :/ why? how do it fix this?
[00:09] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  dvdfab worked for me  under wine last i tried it i recall.
[00:10] <ThePiousPriest> anyone else have suggestions to get a belkin db 750 to work in 13.04?
[00:10] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  i only needed to use dvdfab for these anoying 'new' dvds that have annoying copyprotection on them (in addation to the decss stuff)
[00:10] <yofun> hey my sound icon in the top tray doesnt work :/ why? how do it fix this?
[00:11] <michael87> Dr_Willis, that is exactly where I am at
[00:11] <yofun> noone? :(
[00:11] <yofun> hey my sound icon in the top tray doesnt work :/ why? how do it fix this? (13.04)
[00:11] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  I just used dvd fab and had it 'image' the dvd to a deprotedted iso file. i then used other tools on it.
[00:13] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, I have a hdd with 400 or so GB dedicated to windows, and 250GB free. I was trying to install debian in that spare 200GB, and it was going fine, however wheezy (just came out) seems rather unstable. I decided to use ubuntu instead, but forgot to delete the debian partition. So, ubuntu installed itself on some measly 11GB partition. My question is, how can I expand my partition to take up the rest of the space? I hvae since d
[00:13] <yofun> hey my sound icon in the top tray doesnt work :/ why? how do it fix this? (13.04)
[00:13] <Dr_Willis> Scriptonaut:  gparted can resize.  use it from a live cd
[00:13] <utfans05_2> Scriptonaut, gparted
[00:13] <Scriptonaut> I have gparted
=== sr105 is now known as sr105|away
[00:14] <Scriptonaut> oh, so I can't do that inside ubuntu?
[00:14] <Scriptonaut> I have to maek a live cd?
[00:14] <Dr_Willis> you DONT resize a partion thats mounted
[00:14] <Scriptonaut> ok, gparted wouldn't let me, good thing
[00:14] <michael87> Dr_Willis, I did what you said. Attempting to reopen dvdfab. Hope it doesn't crash
[00:14] <Scriptonaut> I usually use unetbootin, however it doesn't seem like I was able to make it work with gparted
[00:15] <Scriptonaut> do you know what way I should format my usb drive?
[00:15] <Scriptonaut> unetbootin doesn't seem to do it
[00:15] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  i used dvdfab under wine a few months back to  rip several dvds to video file. Not tried it lately
[00:15] <yofun> hey my sound icon in the top tray doesnt work :/ why? how do it fix this? (13.04)
[00:15] <utfans05_2> Scriptonaut, you could always just do a reinstall and set the partition correctly
[00:16] <Scriptonaut> that's true, however it seems like a bit of a waste of time
[00:16] <Scriptonaut> I just wanted to see if it would be easier this way
[00:16] <yofun> hey my sound icon in the top tray doesnt work :/ why? how do it fix this? (13.04)
[00:16] <ThePiousPriest> Any Luck anyone had with that Belkin Adpater?
[00:17] <utfans05_2> Scriptonaut, did you install from a live version of ubuntu? if so just load that back up and open a terminal and run gparted
[00:17] <Scriptonaut> I think I just used a netinst
[00:17] <Scriptonaut> but I deleted it
[00:17] <Scriptonaut> from the USB
[00:17] <Scriptonaut> doing other things
[00:17] <utfans05_2> Scriptonaut, just redownload the iso
[00:18] <Scriptonaut> I have gparted iso right here, I'm curious what format I shoudl use for bootable usbs
[00:18] <michael87> Dr_Willis, I think you have to have certain override or whatever to make it work properly. I dunno but it keeps crashing on me wither I have any over rides on or not.
[00:18] <Scriptonaut> I have disk utility open
[00:18] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  overrides? Hmm.. dont recall ever  needing to do anything
[00:18] <utfans05_2> Scriptonaut, you should be able to use unetbootin to install that iso on a bootable usb drive and do it that way
[00:19] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  im on a Vbox setuo right now - or i would try it. ;)
[00:19] <Scriptonaut> ya, I did that. HOwever it's complaining about the format
[00:19] <Scriptonaut> it doesnt' recognize fat32 aparently
[00:19] <Scriptonaut> well, W95 Fat32
[00:19] <Scriptonaut> and it won't let me format it because apparently the drive is budy
[00:19] <Scriptonaut> sorry for noob questions

[00:20] <utfans05_2> Scriptonaut, you have to unmount the drive before you can do that
[00:20] <michael87> Dr_Willis, crashed again :(. and I have done it at default many many times before I gave an overdrives a shot.
[00:20] <yofun> meh :/ i get ignored :(
[00:20] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  im not even sure what an overdrive is. ;)
[00:21] <Dr_Willis> yofun:  flood the channel get ignored.. you could give more details.. and someone MIght know somthing
[00:21] <yofun> well idk what else to give
[00:21] <michael87> Dr_Willis, override. Sorry family is frusterating me lol
[00:21] <Dr_Willis> does SOUND work? and its just that one mixer thats not working?
[00:21] <yofun> the sound does work
[00:22] <yofun> but the top tray control doesnt work
[00:22] <ThePiousPriest> I'm surprised my Logitech g930 headset works straight off the install
[00:22] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  i dont recall ever using overrides either.
[00:23] <Scunizi> michael87: do you mean "overclock"?
[00:23] <michael87> Dr_Willis, ok forget overrides. I'm canelling them. But by default the sucker shuts itself down.
[00:23] <Scunizi> yofun: how does the top tray control not work? you mean it won't control the volumn?
[00:24] <michael87> Scunizi, no I'm not overclocking anything. Tryying to rip a dvd with a newwer protection. though this is an older dvd. as far as I know only dvdfab can bypass it and it keeps shutting down
[00:24] <yofun> when i cick it i get nothing
[00:24] <Dr_Willis> i imagine its set to handle the pcm or wav  'channel' instead of the main channel.. but im not sure where to change what channel it handles.
[00:24] <Scunizi> michael87: ah.. sorry. I came in late and didn't catch the beginning.
[00:25] <yofun> Scunizi:  when i cick it i get nothing.but the control in the settings does work
[00:25] <yofun> but not the top trey
[00:25] <yofun> tray*
[00:25] <Scunizi> yofun: is this a fresh install?
[00:25] <yofun> yes ubuntu 13.04
[00:26] <michael87> Scunizi, it is fine. if you can help that would be great. This is frusterating. I gave up windows 7 for raring ringtail and except for this tiny very annoyying problem I am enjoyying it emensly
[00:26] <Scunizi> yofun: have you done all the updates?
[00:26] <yofun> no
[00:26] <Scunizi> yofun: do them.. might just fix your issue
[00:26] <yofun> kk
[00:26] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  whats really sad is that some of those uber-protected dvds wont even play on a real dvd player for me.
[00:28] <michael87> Dr_Willis, sad. But there has to be a way to do this easily on ubuntu. and this dvdfab thing is really really bothering me.
[00:28] <Scunizi> michael87: last I heard libdvdcss2 was the correct library for ripping.. but it's been a while.. also Handbrake is the only program that I've tried it from.
[00:28] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  dvd fab has so many   differnt tools.. i dont even rember what i used or how i did it.. it was about 7 mo ago also.
=== root is now known as Guest66957
[00:29] <Dr_Willis> Scunizi:  the issue is there are new generations of addational copy protection on many Video DVDS.  not just the decss stuff.
[00:30] <Scunizi> Dr_Willis: i kinda figured.. It's been a while since I've tried to rip anything.
[00:30] <utfans05_2> Scriptonaut, did you get it figured out?
[00:31] <Scunizi> michael87: Dr_Willis if dvdfab runs in windows only or wine (maybe) how about a vbox vm of winXX with a storage location on the NX side of the ripping equation??
[00:31] <Dr_Willis> michael87:  what part of dvd fab are you trying to use? Passkey? dvdrip? or dvdcopy ?
[00:33] <johnjohn1011> a lot of sites are saying dvdfab runs great in wine.  is this as good as handbrake?
[00:34] <pragmaticenigma> Handbrake requires the content to be decrypted before it can process the video
[00:34] <Dr_Willis> johnjohn1011:  handbreak is more of a special purpose reencoder.. dvdfab does a bit more.

[00:38] <tgm4883> Dr_Willis, for what?
[00:39] <Dr_Willis> most of the.. err..  'new videos' i find these days from.. err.. 'sites'  :) are  not in mkv any more..
[00:39] <wilee-nilee> Mneumonic, Deal breaker, heh don't let the door hit you on the way out. ;)

[00:41] <Mneumonic> WeThePeople, I've only had luck with the 64 bit versions of 12.10 and 13.04 in a dual boot with Win8

[00:44] <WeThePeople> wilee-nilee, 12.04.2 64bit will recognize efi
[00:44] <wilee-nilee> WeThePeople, The wubi?
[00:44] <WeThePeople> idk
[00:44] <wilee-nilee> WeThePeople, I don't think so.
[00:44] <WeThePeople> it has a seperate efi folder on the disc
[00:45] <WeThePeople> idk if that is wubi
[00:45] <wilee-nilee> WeThePeople, Wubi is not installed from the disc.
[00:45] <Mneumonic> WeThePeople I'm not trying to be mean but you should stop trying to get 12.04 to work with windows 8.  I spent a few days trying and got too frustrated
[00:46] <wilee-nilee> anymore you would use the wubi app, and as far a s I have seen wont install due to gpt partitioning.

[00:47] <Mneumonic> in 13.04 my wireless randomly stops working and I have to disconnects and reconnect to get it working again.  Any ideas?
[00:47] <ray2> 12.04..Is there a way to set popup windows where they will be centered on unity desktop
[00:47] <Mneumonic> Also, occasionally during shutdown the system freezes at mount: / is busy and doesn't shut down

[00:48] <hdon> Can anyone recommend something like the Gnome panel applet showing CPU, memory allocation, swap allocation, network tx/rx, for Ubuntu 12?

[00:49] <ThePiousPriest> anyone know a good wireless USB card available at somewhere like BB that would work out of the box for linux?
[00:49] <ThePiousPriest> looking for something Wireless N
[00:52] <Mneumonic> in 13.04 my wireless randomly stops working and I have to disconnects and reconnect to get it working again.  Any ideas?
[00:54] <Dr_Willis> hdon:  its possible thers indicator-applets for those tasks taht would work/show up in  the gnome panel.
[00:55] <Dr_Willis> ThePiousPriest:  i find it best to see whats in teh store then look for reviews once you are there  to see what chipset it has and how well it works on ubuntu
[00:55] <Dr_Willis> ThePiousPriest:  or just order from amazon. ;)
[00:55] <ThePiousPriest> I'm perhaps being too greedy looking for AC ones that would work in Ubuntu when 802.11 AC hasn't even been finalized yet
[00:56] <Dr_Willis> ThePiousPriest:  watch out for brands/makes that use the same product name. but may have differnt chipsets.  My video capture usb dongle was that way. :( the newer ones have a diffent chipset.
[00:56] <ThePiousPriest> Ah, gotta find the Dual Band ones since my router is a DB router
[00:56] <Mneumonic> in 13.04 my wireless randomly stops working and I have to disconnects and reconnect to get it working again.  Any ideas?
[00:57] <netlar> Dr_Willis: is there a list in linux for what chipsets are supported?
[00:57] <Dr_Willis> ThePiousPriest:   theres those wifi->network cable  gizmos that plug in to your pcs NIC. (or on a PS3 or xbox3 or whatever) that work with no drivers. :) its like a mini router.. but they are mor eexpensibe
[00:57] <Dr_Willis> !hcl
[00:57] <ubottu> For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport - To help debugging and improving hardware detection, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingHardwareDetection
[00:57] <Dr_Willis> the hard part is often finding what chipset a device actually has.
[00:58] <ThePiousPriest> NIC cards via PCI/PCI-E?
[00:58] <mish-> I have a 3TB RAID5 array, inside that is a 2TB partition called "/dev/md0p1", I want to extend that partition to occupy the full 3TB, how can I do that?
[00:58] <Dr_Willis> ThePiousPriest:  this was a gizmo that pluged into an existing Network port on whatever device.. and turned it wireless. :) the device still thinks its wired
[00:59] <Dr_Willis> ThePiousPriest:  often used for Game Consoles. or smart tvs with no wireless built in.

[01:00] <Mneumonic> in 13.04 my wireless randomly stops working and I have to disconnect and reconnect to get it working again.  Any ideas?
[01:00] <Dr_Willis> ThePiousPriest:  the upside is they  work with most anything that can have a browser to configure the device.. downside is they are like $40
[01:00] <ThePiousPriest> Eh, that doesn't bother me, gonna check to see if I have a port open for it on my motherboard
[01:00] <Dr_Willis> ThePiousPriest:  i have seen some wifi dongles that actually mention 'linux' on the supported OS's :)
[01:01] <chachin> O.o
[01:02] <ThePiousPriest> Amazon has it for like 35 bucks
[01:02] <ThePiousPriest> that doesn't concern me

[01:02] <Mneumonic> WoW works pretty well in wine

[01:03] <ThePiousPriest> Supposedly Blizzard is bringing a port to Linux with an announcement this summer
[01:03] <ThePiousPriest> Probably E3
[01:03] <Mneumonic> ThePiousPriest source?
[01:03] <kilmer> they had better

[01:04] <Mneumonic> ThePiousPriest this is highly unlikely to be WoW
[01:04] <ThePiousPriest> blizzard has internal linux resources that are used to test WoW
[01:04] <ThePiousPriest> Not wow, but some title
[01:04] <ThePiousPriest> I'm hoping SC2
[01:05] <kilmer> No, must be wow pls =)
[01:05] <Mneumonic> My guess is a MOBA game
[01:05] <kilmer> would only make sense
[01:05] <kilmer> most of ther customers are in wow.
[01:05] <ThePiousPriest> I know Blizzard has crapped over D3, but getting a "AAA" game on Linux is important
[01:05] <Mneumonic> WoW is written in directx
[01:05] <Mneumonic> WoW has terrible OpenGL support
[01:06] <ThePiousPriest> Conjecture  on my part is that Gabe and Valve are taking their sweet time with HL3 is that they want to make it revolutionary AND support Linux right out of the box
[01:06] <Dr_Willis> Blizard has annoyed me too much.. i wont buy their products any more.  ;) but this is ot..
[01:07] <ThePiousPriest> fair enough
[01:07] <Mneumonic> So anyone have any recommendation for fixing my wireless in 13.04?  It randomly stops working and I have to disconnect/reconnect to get it working again

[01:26] <ThePiousPriest> I hope so, otherwise I will rage hard lol
[01:26] <Dr_Willis> ThePiousPriest:  i find it funny that people use wifi cards.. then the antannas are normally positioned in such bad spots.. behind a metal case. right up to a wall, often sitting way down low on the floor.
[01:26] <ThePiousPriest> I can't move my tower, router is downstairs and people would get pissed if I ran cabling
[01:26] <ThePiousPriest> too lazy to run through the walls
[01:27] <ThePiousPriest> If I was, I would run cat 6 to future proof
[01:27] <Dr_Willis> if the router is right below or above you . you might need to rearange your antannas a bit for best signal.
[01:27] <computer88> shouldnt wine 1.5.29  be just as good or better than 1.5.13
[01:27] <ThePiousPriest> yeah, it's almost right below me
[01:27] <Dr_Willis> computer88:  normally thats the case.. newer vesions have more bug fixs and other features..
[01:27] <ThePiousPriest> After finishing my Net+, Linux + is my next stop
[01:28] <Dr_Willis> ThePiousPriest:  You might want to angle the antannsas so  the are parallwl to the floor a bit.  and if the router has an antanna . allign them that way also
[01:28] <computer88> ubuntu 12 percise with wine has a platinum rating for office 2010(installer) but ringtail with 1.5.29 has no rating for office
[01:29] <Dr_Willis> because no one has rated it yet perhaps computer88 .
[01:29] <jrib> computer88: I think those ratings are submitted by users so no one has gotten to it probably
[01:29] <jrib> computer88: it's your time to shine ;)
[01:29] <computer88> should i use the ubuntu 12 instead of 13 for my M$ office
[01:30] <Dr_Willis> best would be to use Libreoffice computer88
[01:30] <ThePiousPriest> Anyone have their Linux+?
[01:30] <computer88> ubuntu 13 has only games mainly with at rating at wine.org
[01:30] <Dr_Willis> i saw some mention of a differnt office suite the other day.. but  i dont use that stuff much

[01:50] <Dr_Willis> yep. for a little bit at least
[01:52] <shape> Dr_Willis: It's a quick thing anywya. My setup is : 80GB HDD with 2 partitions 1 windows 7 1 ubuntu. And I want to move everything to a new bigger  HDD, clone everything. I've tried Clonezilla and it breaks my windows install and can't recover it. Do you know any other cloning software?
[01:52] <Dr_Willis> you could alwyas use a live cd and 'dd' then resize the partions
[01:53] <shape> Dr_Willis: any links to that? I'm afraid to use DD :(
[01:53] <Dr_Willis> dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4m               then when done..  use gparted to tweak the new hd.
[01:54] <Dr_Willis> ive done that in the past to 'clone' a 8gb usb flash install of ubuntu onto a HD.
=== dominic_ is now known as mdih
[01:54] <shape> Dr_Willis: so that just clones sda to sdb drive to drive and then i'd just have to resize with gparted?
[01:54] <Dr_Willis> yep. or make a new partion for the unused space.
[01:54] <shape> Dr_Willis: what is the bs for?
[01:54] <Dr_Willis> which is what i was doing.
[01:54] <Dr_Willis> block size.
[01:55] <Dr_Willis> otherwise dd will be very slow

[01:55] <computer88> how can i update wine from the commandline
[01:55] <shape> Dr_Willis: I see
[01:55] <Dr_Willis> 4M for 4 meg.
[01:55] <Dr_Willis> computer88:  sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade   upgrades the system to the latest thats in the repos
[01:56] <computer88> ty ty
[01:56] <shape> Dr_Willis: thing is clonezilla already has a drive to drive thing, but I didnt use it because I wanted the partitions to be one after the other and not all over the place. I guess that doesn't really matter right?
[01:56] <Dr_Willis> all over the place?  i dont see how they would be all over the place
[01:57] <shape> Dr_Willis: well the unpartitioned space, that im resizing into the new ones, would be on a different part of the platter
[01:57] <shape> Dr_Willis: which would slow it down a bit since it has to jump, etc.

[02:10] <shape> wilee-nilee: the reason is I saw you in the windows channel yesterday and I wanted to know what Stryyker recommended me to use for cloning instead of Clonezilla
[02:10] <shape> wilee-nilee: It should be 20 hours ago or so
[02:10] <wilee-nilee> shape, Acronis I believe
[02:11] <wilee-nilee> shape, What release of W7 do you have?
[02:11] <shape> wilee-nilee: that was just for partition alignment not for cloning, it had 3 nouns or something
[02:11] <shape> wilee-nilee: ultimate
[02:11] <wilee-nilee> shape, Heh, I use the onboard imager myself it has never failed.
[02:12] <shape> wilee-nilee: WOW, nvm he JUST replied, wtf
[02:12] <wilee-nilee> ah easeus
[02:13] <wilee-nilee> shape, You can image windows 7 from the backup options
[02:13] <shape> wilee-nilee: and then restore that image with the windows DVD correct?
[02:14] <wilee-nilee> shape, Yep, it will not clone the linux is all.
[02:14] <shape> wilee-nilee: but if I want to restore it to a fresh partition, will that work? As in if I create an image on some separate HDD, how will it restore it, I have to give it a new partition ,or leave unpartitioned space, etc.?
[02:15] <wilee-nilee> shape, Yes, I transfered my W8 from a spinning HD to a SSD with it.
[02:15] <Gautam> utfans05: flashplugin-installer did the trick! thanks!
[02:15] <shape> wilee-nilee: and it will fix the mrb automatically, etc.?
[02:15] <utfans05> Gautam, your welcome
[02:16] <wilee-nilee> shape, It does not save the mbr, but all you have to do put the clone of ubuntu after and run a update-grub or reload the mbr, which is pretty easy.
[02:17] <wilee-nilee> shape,Just don't go all OCD on that 63 2048 space preceding the sda1 partition.

[02:17] <russ5811> Hi. Can anyone tell me how to disable keyring after auto login in 13.04? Thanks
[02:18] <shape> wilee-nilee: what i mean is, when i restore the windows image, it will also restore it;s own mbr with it's own windows bootloader, etc. right? As in it will be fully functional doing the image way.
[02:18] <wilee-nilee> shape, I believe it just loads the image not the mbr, but that isan easy fix as well.
[02:19] <wilee-nilee> bootrec.exe /fixmbr from the booted recovery or install disc cli
[02:19] <shape> wilee-nilee: yeah, but yesterday those didn't work. So what I was asking is windows does something EXTRA to make sure the loaded image will damn work, right?
[02:20] <wilee-nilee> shape, Honestly from watching you, you just messed with the wrong things and tried to recover a bricked partition that you bricked.
[02:21] <wilee-nilee> user error in other words
[02:21] <shape> wilee-nilee: I tried cloning it again today, even with the default clonezilla settings and with no partitioned second drive, just the windows and it did the same.
[02:22] <wilee-nilee> shape, I was not there, all I can say I have never had clonezilla fail.
[02:22] <pliz> excuse me,  no one with suspend shutdown problems?
[02:22] <shape> wilee-nilee: however as we speak i just decided to clone disk by disk (not partition by partition) and then just resize with gparted

[02:23] <utfans05> russ5811, try this http://www.noob2geek.com/how-to/how-to-disable-gnome-keyring-in-ubuntu-10-04/
[02:23] <wilee-nilee> shape, I would not resize widows with gparted myself, it has an excellent partitioner.
[02:23] <wilee-nilee> for itself
[02:23] <utfans05> russ5811, its all based off the same thing so that same process should work
[02:24] <wilee-nilee> shape, They here is do not resize until you have run it and defragged...etc.
[02:24] <shape> wilee-nilee: really? what is it called?
[02:24] <wilee-nilee> shape, Disk manager I think, runs in admin.
[02:25] <shape> wilee-nilee: wow, disk manager can rezise now? sweet. So what you meant above was just to defrag first and then resize, correct?
[02:26] <wilee-nilee> shape, I would do the transfer, amke sure it boots, it may want to run a auto-chkdsk, and then resize with the onboard.
[02:26] <wilee-nilee> make*
[02:27] <shape> wilee-nilee: What about the ubuntu partition, there is no defragging to be done because of the ext4 correct? I can just resize with gparted
[02:27] <wilee-nilee> shape, How full is that windows partition?
[02:28] <a> a
[02:28] <wilee-nilee> shape, Correct no defragg with linux.
=== a is now known as Guest1800
[02:28] <shape> wilee-nilee: 95% full, but moving it to a bigger one of course. Clonezilla already gave it 50GB more with the disk to disk clone.
[02:29] <wilee-nilee> shape, Ah, that is to full no wonder you have had problems.
[02:29] <ubuntu__> Guten Tag!
[02:29] <shape> wilee-nilee: why do you say that? would it matter?
[02:30] <wilee-nilee> shape, It does matter with ntfs, and exen ext tyoe parttions, but people will argue both sides, personally I never go above 50%
[02:30] <wilee-nilee> I have big externals though
[02:32] <shape> wilee-nilee: I see, oh well, now it's disk to disk, and it's almost done. Hopefully everything will work, and if not i'll have to do the windows image thing.
[02:32] <shape> wilee-nilee: also wanted to thank you for taking the time and helping me. Much appreciated.
[02:32] <russ5811> thanks utfans05
[02:32] <benzrf> hello! I'm on raring and when I tap alt-tab briefly it switches to my previous window, even if it was in the same application.
[02:32] <benzrf> how can I make it so that it will _always_ go between applications?
[02:33] <horrorxstory> hey
[02:33] <wilee-nilee> shape, I would pull out some of that extra stuff to a external and run some cleaning tools and make sure it is fully defragged if it were me, maybe even a chkdsk. I have found windows does need maintenance in general, much more then linux.
[02:34] <horrorxstory> windows just annoys every fiber of my being
[02:35] <wilee-nilee> I rarely use it except for word in writing grad papers, but keep it in perfect condition.
[02:35] <horrorxstory> i completely removed that partition last night
[02:35] <horrorxstory> since i can run office on wine
[02:36] <wilee-nilee> horribly yes
[02:36] <horrorxstory> lol mine runs smooth
[02:36] <wilee-nilee> I would use libreoffice first
[02:36] <horrorxstory> so does spotify which im very confused about
[02:36] <shape> wilee-nilee: but for grad papers, if not libreoffice, why not just run it in a vm and not care about housekeeping it so much
[02:36] <horrorxstory> this is true
[02:37] <horrorxstory> so my webcam isnt working though
[02:38] <wilee-nilee> shape, I don't like vm's I want to OS's I have installed to run at full throttle. the maintence is not that much really if you do it, not wait till its broke. Most of which can be put on a schedule.
[02:38] <Xenolithic> Evening, folks. Is there a way to make it so new windows don't take focus away from the window I'm currently in? I looked around on askubuntu and such, but none of the suggested fixes seemed to do anything.
[02:39] <horrorxstory> hey
[02:39] <horrorxstory> =
[02:41] <benzrf> I'm on raring and when I tap alt-tab briefly it switches to my previous window, even if it was  in the same application.
[02:41] <benzrf> how can I make it so that it will _always_ go between applications?
[02:41] <shape> wilee-nilee: I see, I wanted to quite using windows for good and try to get games to run in VM running windows, do you have any experience with that, will I lose lots of performance?
[02:42] <wilee-nilee> shape, I suppose it depends on your hardware really and what you are happy with.

[02:43] <wilee-nilee> my computer ren=boot in less than a minute and I have 4 OS's so I'm cruising all of them at times.
[02:43] <wilee-nilee> reboots*
[02:44] <wilee-nilee> I do have a vm of XP it deserves being there, lol
[02:45] <shape> wilee-nilee: btw clonezilla just finished the disk to disk clone and I have all the other space unallocated, With ubuntu and gparted i know there won't be a problem expanding the partition but for windows to expand it do you recommend like you said earlier to use disk manager?
[02:48] <wilee-nilee> shape, First I don't use clonezilla that way I save the image to a external then reload it, I have seen another have problems that way, it may have been you. But see if it boots and resize it with its partitioner. If you had saved that with packets you could have a partition already there and not have to resize using clonezilla.
[02:48] <shape> wilee-nilee: it did boot, all was fine, it's like the old HDD, and it just has the extra space unallocted.
[02:49] <ezio> raaaaaaaaaaaaaage ... kerberos is messing with my head
[02:49] <wilee-nilee> shape, Cool, the onboard has a resize option I think it will allow you to expand it into the unallocated.
[02:49] <shape> wilee-nilee: I never resized with clonezilla. It was a weird thing that happened, clonezilla said there will be new partitions with no unallocated space but now I see it lied and all the extra space is unallocated.
[02:50] <shape> wilee-nilee: yep
[02:50] <wilee-nilee> shape, I meant using clonezilla, it is designed when saving in packages to be put in an equal or larger partition.
[02:50] <shape> wilee-nilee: btw, does it matter if I defrag first and then expand or I can defrag after expanding. It shouldnt matter right, since the expansion will just be seen as empty space.
[02:51] <wilee-nilee> shape, I doubt that disc is fully defraggable that full.
[02:51] <makara> software-centre won't open with an invalid ppa in the sources list
[02:51] <ezio> how can i reinstall all the default stuff in a package and have it overwrite all the configs, etc
[02:51] <shape> wilee-nilee: yeah, it only has 1GB left rofl
[02:52] <wilee-nilee> shape, resize with a couple of hail maries.
[02:52] <wilee-nilee> ;)
[02:52] <shape> wilee-nilee: yeah im giving it double of what it has now
[02:52] <makara> ezio, in synaptic find the package and say remove completely
[02:52] <ezio> how do i do it with apt-get
[02:52] <makara> don't know
[02:53] <wilee-nilee> makara, Sounds more like a broken upgrade.
[02:53] <shape> wilee-nilee: is the 50% space available partition thing you mentioned earlier valid for ext4 as well?
[02:53] <makara> wilee-nilee, what is command to autofix?
[02:54] <wilee-nilee> shape, That is just my default, I have extensive external HD space so I pretty much just have the OS's on the HD.
[02:54] <makara> ezio, apt-get purge
[02:54] <makara> ezio, man apt-get
[02:54] <veryhappy> hey guys, where would i have to ask questions about nvidia related graphics card stuff?
[02:55] <wilee-nilee> shape, I have seen 70 % is about the most you want, but many will argue both sides on this, I just go the low end and have externals so I don't lose anything ever.
[02:55] <ezio> makara, thanks
[02:55] <shape> wilee-nilee: I can't extend volume with disk management btw there is no unallocated space on the right of partition (and extend volume is greyed out)
[02:55] <utfans05> veryhappy, what questions do you have?
[02:57] <shape> wilee-nilee: so I guess gparted it is :(
[02:57] <veryhappy> utfans05: well, they removed the overscan setting in the nvidia control center and that's why i can't control the position of my hdmi picture anymore, i'm clueless what to do now.
[02:57] <wilee-nilee> shape, You have to have an unallocated to expand it, I would resize the linux leaving the unallocated for the windows resize.
[02:57] <wilee-nilee> resize the linux with gparted, windows can't do it.

[02:57] <utfans05> veryhappy, what driver are you currently running?
[02:58] <veryhappy> nvidia-current
[02:58] <veryhappy> utfans05: nvidia-current
[02:58] <wilee-nilee> shape, That is an extended you made in ubuntu with a logical ubuntu partition right?
[02:58] <shape> wilee-nilee: yes
[02:59] <utfans05> veryhappy, try doing the info in the 2nd post from this link http://www.pclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?topic=106650.0
