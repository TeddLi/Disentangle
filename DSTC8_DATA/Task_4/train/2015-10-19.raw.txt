[06:41] <vcoinminer> hi anyone familiar with vim?? may I ask, I have 2 questions. 1. I open file with ctrl-p and :ls the buffer numbers shows something like 1 & 3.   why the buffer number is 3 instead of 2??   does that means there has hidden buffer? if so, how can I just remove hidden buffer, or just make the buffer number to 2
[06:41] <somsip> vcoinminer: b:2 will change to buffer 2, but likely it's gone (:q or :bd)
[06:42] <somsip> er.. :b 2
[06:43] <lotuspsychje> vcoinminer: maybe the #vim guys know?
[06:44] <vcoinminer> somsip ya, :bd kill the buffer, and that's the case if you have buffer 1&2(hidden?)&3.    but I would like to just make new file as number 2
[06:44] <vcoinminer> lotuspsychje oh, thanks. :D
[06:46] <somsip> vcoinminer: buffers will be allocated as they are needed AFAIK
[06:47] <vcoinminer> somsip hmm. that must broken somewhere because some plugins...  thanks. :)

[08:46] <Bleakwise> my interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces don't show up in ifconfig
[08:46] <cfhowlett> !aptlock | abb4s that would be a different error than you reported earlier.
[08:46] <ubottu> abb4s that would be a different error than you reported earlier.: If an APT front-end crashed and your database is locked, try this in a !terminal: « sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a »

=== agent_white is now known as isthatyoujonwayn
[08:48] <cfhowlett> abb4s, do.  you have a process running which has locked your apt database.  therefore, new processes can't use it.  no dpgk, no install , no updates.
[08:48] <spygame> OerHeks: here's the output http://paste.ubuntu.com/12858676/
[08:49] <cfhowlett> abb4s, I would bet you have automatic updates running

[08:58] <Bleakwise> any reason why creating virtual network interfaces in ubuntu isn't documented?
[08:58] <Bleakwise> every doc says to use /etc/network/interfaces, but that file is ignored by ubuntu
[08:58] <abb4s> cfhowlett, thanks really man it is working ...
[08:58] <cfhowlett> happy2help!  abb4s
[09:00] <Bleakwise> i mean do i need to disable "network-manager" or something?
[09:02] <abb4s> cfhowlett, separate from this issue the termbin.com is an amazing idea ... :O

[09:02] <cfhowlett> abb4s, I actually prefer pastebinit, but most folks use the default host which can't get past the Great Firewall
[09:03] <Bleakwise> i think it would be great if somewhere in the documentation about /etc/network/interfaces there was some mention about managed=true needing to be set in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
[09:05] <Bleakwise> otherwise it's kind of like giving someone a new car and but denying them the keys and the title

[09:12] <cfhowlett> abb4s, ok
[09:12] <agent_white> Bleakwise: Not a bad idea to emphasize in the wiki!  Maybe you should see about contributing that! -- That askubuntu response does slightly emply that enabling "managed" means you intend to solely use network-manager to manage those network interfaces... I believe...
=== BlackDevil is now known as DarkShadow-x
[09:16] <agent_white> Bleakwise: On another note, Ubuntu will be switching to systemd in the near future (and already has started to fully move), so you'll be wanting to look into systemd-networkd which deals with virtual network devices.

[09:51] <dimitrios__> I have installed maldet on Ubuntu 12.04 with ClamAV. Postfix is also running there. The problem is that when doing manual scans I get the report with the results and also an email is sent to the email address I have set in the maldet configuration. But the problem is that I was hoping the maldet itself should scan daily by default and send emails with its findings, which in my case it doesnt. Is there anything that I have to do enable the cronjob to

[10:21] <lyss> does ubuntu have transmission embedded?
[10:21] <agent_white> b100s: Alt+F8 ? or Alt+Middle-mouse button ?
[10:21] <chrismck1nnel> agent_white: i think i've tracked down why i'm getting such verbose logging in auth.log - looks like someone installed snoopy on the box which records every since command run by any user
[10:22] <fes> lyss, yes it does.
[10:22] <chrismck1nnel> agent_white: thanks all the same (my problem was my auth.log file ended up 5gb over the weekend)
[10:22] <agent_white> chrismck1nnel: Generally, auth.log is (as the name of it says) for authorizations, as well as usages of sudo.
[10:22] <fes> lyss, at least in the gnome edition.
[10:22] <chrismck1nnel> agent_white: yeah exactly, that's why i was so confused, but it looks like a third party app is to blame
[10:23] <b100s> agent_white, thx a lot
[10:23] <agent_white> chrismck1nnel: Oh wow! What in the hell... why it records in auth.log is... not smart on snoopy's part.

[10:27] <agent_white> chrismck1nnel: Looks like auth.log is the default location for pretty much all the distros it's aimed towards... maybe toss-out snoopy and just filter entries from syslog?

[12:46] <MrWhiskers> is SED the best tool for that?
[12:46] <daftykins> MrWhiskers: #bash is more relevant there i'd think
[12:47] <EriC^^> MrWhiskers: if you always expect Reboot Required, you could use grep -o "Reboot Required"

[12:50] <hateball> test__: vgdisplay
[12:51] <EriC^^> MrWhiskers: you could use this ugly hack | awk '/status/' | sed -e 's/<statusString>//' -e 's/<\/statusString>//'
[12:51] <hateball> test__: oh, also you see in /etc/fstab what is mounted where
[12:52] <test__> hateball: not that, the name of that logical volume
[12:52] <test__> any command for that
[12:52] <hateball> test__: lvdisplay
[12:52] <test__> lvdisplay shows the name as /dev/ubuntu-vg/root

[13:22] <pHuNk3r5> lotuspsychje, It doesn't fail to boot.  It just errors when I try to apt-get install new programs

[13:22] <ModFather> ipoxfred : unrar e book.rar
[13:23] <lotuspsychje> pHuNk3r5: it gave you the error while software center and using apt-get simultaneously probably

[13:55] <Guest734> so who can help me install libre office in ubuntu 12.04 as i have failured install the office package through double click installing process with.gz file
[13:55] <KomiaPoika> lotuspsychje: i'm backing up the home dir to another box using scp -r so i see all the files in clear but it's also copuying those thousands of files
[13:55] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: sudo apt-get install libreoffice
[13:56] <EriC^^> RubyDZ: you dont need to reinstall to change the pass, unless you want to upgrade anyways or fresh install
[13:56] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  iv tried that process ago, but it din work
[13:56] <MonkeyDust> Guest734  libreoffice comes with ubuntu, no need for a ter
[13:56] <MonkeyDust> tar*
[13:56] <Guest734> MonkeyDust:  my ubuntu doesnt have libreoffice
[13:56] <lotuspsychje> KomiaPoika: not sure, i thought encryption made 1 big file
[13:56] <lotuspsychje> !info libreoffice precise
[13:56] <RubyDZ> Eric^^: I actually tried multiple times to retrieve the password but I failed ... I want to upgrade and have a fresh install
[13:56] <ubottu> libreoffice (source: libreoffice): office productivity suite. In component main, is optional. Version 1:3.5.7-0ubuntu8 (precise), package size 23 kB, installed size 158 kB
[13:56] <MonkeyDust> Guest734  the install it, from the repos
[13:56] <KomiaPoika> it does, when you just plugin the hard drive
[13:57] <KomiaPoika> anyway it wasn't that many files so i'll just keep them just in case
[13:57] <lotuspsychje> KomiaPoika: ok good luck
[13:57] <KomiaPoika> thx
[13:57] <Guest734> MonkeyDust:  u mean how to do that
[13:57]  * Guest734 a new user to linux world
[13:57] <MonkeyDust> Guest734  like you would install any other program
[13:58] <Guest734> MonkeyDust:  iv tried the installation file downloading from interent but i din work
[13:58] <MonkeyDust> Guest734  from the software menu, or with apt-get install
[13:58] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install libreoffice
[13:58] <EriC^^> RubyDZ: ok
[13:59] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  MonkeyDust  in tried all the process everything installs though terminal but the problem is the office section of application doesnt show libre office, hence i cant use that
[13:59] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: did you have error after installing from terminal?
[13:59] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  no
[13:59] <Guest734> no error
[14:00] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: it installed correctly and you cant see libreoffice icons?
[14:00] <RubyDZ> EriC^^: So my issue is that the LiveUSB is freezing immediately after I choose the Install option ... even trying to power off the laptop doesn't work, I have to remove the battery to turn the thing off. Removing the USB doesn't make it unfreeze/power off either.
[14:00] <KomiaPoika> how do i see my network adapter in ubunut?
[14:00] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  yes i cant see
[14:00] <RubyDZ> I'm not sure how I can reinstall
[14:00] <KomiaPoika> how do i see my network adapter make and model in ubuntu?
[14:00] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: you searched dash also?
[14:01] <EriC^^> RubyDZ: hmm, no idea, i can help you recover the old pass if you want to get any files or something though
[14:01] <RubyDZ> EriC^^: No need for that, there are no any files on this that are important ...
[14:01] <RubyDZ> I'm just looking for help reinstalling it
[14:02] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  yeah, it only shows .gz file in download folder
[14:02] <daftykins> KomiaPoika: "lspci" if it's an internal card
[14:02] <MonkeyDust> KomiaPoika  try lspci | grep network
[14:02] <MonkeyDust> KomiaPoika  try lspci | grep Network
[14:02] <KomiaPoika> ah yes thank you
[14:03] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: type libreoffice in terminal please
[14:03] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  ok sure hold a sec
[14:04] <RubyDZ> Could my old Ubuntu installation be corrupted and interfering with my LiveUSB's performance?
[14:04] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  it says libreoffice is currently not installed to install it....
[14:04] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: ok now sudo apt-get install libreoffice
[14:04] <daftykins> RubyDZ: not really. not unless it's trying to mount your internal disk
[14:05] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  it says to do.. apt-get install libreoffice-common
[14:05] <Guest734> which one should i do lotuspsychje
[14:05] <RubyDZ> I remember that I reinstalled this old version a few times - there was something wrong with it, not sure what
[14:05] <RubyDZ> Trying to boot it up now shows me some error message about mounting manually or something
[14:05] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: have you been uninstalling things you shouldnt?
[14:05] <maddawg2> is there a way to tell what version of a package is in the ubuntu repos?
[14:05] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: try what it asks yes
[14:06] <maddawg2> i w ant to find out if OwnCloud is current or if i should install from the official repo
[14:06] <daftykins> RubyDZ: are you typing from the live session now?
[14:06] <daftykins> maddawg2: apt-cache showpkg <package>
[14:06] <lotuspsychje> !info owncloud | maddawg2
[14:06] <ubottu> maddawg2: Package owncloud does not exist in vivid
[14:06] <RubyDZ> No I'm on my other laptop - Dell running Win 7
[14:06] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  ok let me do the libreoffice-common thing
[14:06] <daftykins> RubyDZ: but it's booted into live right now?
[14:06] <RubyDZ> daftykins: No the LiveUSB is booted but frozen on the options screen
[14:07] <RubyDZ> The Installer boot menu
[14:07] <daftykins> RubyDZ: does it respond to "Ctrl+Alt+F1" ?
[14:07] <daftykins> oh that one.
[14:07] <daftykins> you should run memtest.
[14:07] <maddawg2> hmm owncloud should exist
[14:07] <maddawg2> lol
[14:07] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  is it possible to install the libreoffice wirting program only?
[14:07] <RubyDZ> memtest on the installer boot menu?
[14:07] <RubyDZ> Or on the original installation?
[14:07] <daftykins> or download a bootable memtest ISO.
[14:07] <daftykins> whichever you prefer.

[14:08] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: or what auronandace just suggested
[14:09] <Guest734> ok auronandace  ur command seeems promising.. let me try
[14:10] <RubyDZ> daftykins: I booted up the hard disk (which has an old Ubuntu installation ~2011/2012, I'm trying to reinstall it) and am running memtest86+ v4.20
[14:10] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: libreoffice should be default on 12.04...im wondering what you did to brake it?
[14:10] <RubyDZ> Am I doing this right?
[14:10] <MonkeyDust> Guest734  and not 'ur', but 'your'
[14:10] <daftykins> RubyDZ: well you pick memtest from the menu, so ubuntu itself will not fully boot, no.
[14:10] <auronandace> RubyDZ: why are you using a release that is no longer supported?
[14:11] <RubyDZ> daftykins: yeah it's a blue screen running tests right now
[14:11] <daftykins> auronandace: that's not relevant when the query is a live session not booting.
[14:11] <daftykins> RubyDZ: good stuff, give it until 'passes' hits 2.
[14:11] <daftykins> (it'll take hours)
[14:11] <Guest734> auronandace:  the whole libreoffice installation says it wants 174mb in my HDR, and the only writer demands 200mb space ! :o
[14:11] <uupz> i did sudo apt-get install guake.  now i want to run guake but i'm trying to pin it to a custom bar i have.  how do i run guake from a terminal and still be able to close that terminal and have guake running
[14:12] <auronandace> daftykins: he says he is trying to reinstall it
[14:12] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  actually im using an ubuntu taged as voyager , i think its adorned by some french developers but they din put libreoffice here
[14:12] <lotuspsychje> uupz: run quake as startup item?
[14:12] <daftykins> auronandace: yeah...
[14:12] <MonkeyDust> uupz  add guake to Startup applications... f12 to activate, IIRC
[14:13] <lotuspsychje> Guest734: what kind of ubuntu is this.. got a name?
[14:13] <RubyDZ> auronandace: I actually installed Ubuntu on my old netbook, around '11/'12 and I abandoned it. I'm trying to reinstall it with the latest version of Ubuntu, I just torrented that from the official site last night.
[14:13] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  xfce, voyager

[14:14] <RubyDZ> auronandace: No problem
[14:14] <daftykins> RubyDZ: yeah no need for updates, just keep going until passes gets to 2. it'll be a while
[14:14] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  ohh may i ask why not
[14:15] <Guest734> lotuspsychje:  as its made with ubuntu xfce

[14:26] <badbodh> Zetta, yes
[14:27] <Zetta> badbodh, I see. I have just noticed the notebook don't heat up when running Windows 7.
[14:27] <Zetta> Perhaps then we can rule out the hardware issue possibility?
[14:27] <badbodh> yes. then check if any process is eating up cpu
[14:28] <Zetta> badbodh, Definately Firefox.
[14:28] <badbodh> try clearing the cache
[14:28] <Zetta> badbodh,  It's weird because it's taking a lot more then it should. I'm using Linux for less then a month .
[14:28] <badbodh> remove history> select "everything" instead of "last hour" , and clean only cache
[14:29] <Zetta> Or maybe a bit more but certainly less than two.

[14:29] <SuperLag> daftykins: I stand corrected.
[14:29] <badbodh> then it's website or browser specific. try the same page on another browser. say epiphany or midori
[14:29] <SuperLag> daftykins: thank you, sir
[14:30] <Zetta> Will do.
[14:30] <badbodh> if you still get high cpu usage, the websites are faulty

[14:33] <ioria> Zetta, yeah .... 39 % cpu   if the culprit is FF , maybe flashplayer is involved
[14:33] <OerHeks> Zetta, just read back, on what videocard? the buildin intel or ?
[14:33] <badbodh> Zetta, were you playing the videos on neoseeker ?
[14:33] <Zetta> The building intel, yes, OerHeks.
[14:34] <Zetta> badbodh, no. It's curious because it's just some sites.
[14:34] <Zetta> badbodh, on YouTube I can play videos without the fan going crazy however there are websites that I can't.
[14:34] <auronandace> Zetta: sounds like flash
[14:35] <badbodh> disable flash plugin completely and try. flash on ff is outdated and causes trouble on mine too.

[14:35] <Zetta> badbodh, alright.

[14:46] <Zetta> Just disable it in firefox, right?
[14:46] <badbodh> "Error sync. after initial wipe" indicates you didn;t wait long enough to let the formatting complete

[14:56] <badbodh> syntroPi, midori is new, but catching up. it's a good lightweight alternative browser.
[14:57] <badbodh> Zetta, you may also try palemoon. it's a firewfox clone but sticks to older UI.
[14:58] <syntroPi> badbodh, yes i tried it some time ago and liked it, but they didnt implement one process per tab (or such) then. i faced often myself cursing because the whole thing went down with all tabs. i tried the gtk2 and gtk3 variants
[14:59] <badbodh> for multiprocess use aurora. do note that it's unstable.
[14:59] <syntroPi> badbodh, do you know of a lightweight alternative which does some sandboxing and tab isolation?
[15:00] <Zetta> I guess I'll try downloading a different version of Linux. :\
[15:00] <badbodh> erm, lightweight and tab-isolation are kinda see-saw thing.

[15:08] <nicomachus> full output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/12861750/
[15:09] <Zetta> I see.
[15:09] <SopaXT> it just does not display a window/neither it produces any output
[15:09] <PanV> Then it got me into grub rescue. I reinstalled GRUB with #ubuntu's irc help. I booted into Ubuntu then it got me into the same black screen
[15:09] <lotuspsychje> SopaXT: so it starts allright but just hangs?
[15:09] <PanV> So I rebooted at the LivsUSB.
[15:09] <lotuspsychje> SopaXT: can you install something like terminator?
[15:09] <SopaXT> XTerm works
[15:10] <PanV> So, what am I supposed to do now? Ubuntu seems broken, perhaps all packets need a re-install. Unity could have broken.
[15:10] <lotuspsychje> SopaXT: see if you can purge gnome-terminal and reinstall maybe?
[15:10] <syntroPi> daftykins, ok so the latest ubuntu kernels already include those from https://01.org/ ?
[15:10] <SopaXT> when I try to gdb it -> "file format not recognized"
[15:11] <daftykins> syntroPi: they're already fine yeah, best never to instruct anyone to install from that site, they'll only have a broken setup that's a mess to clean up after :)
[15:11] <syntroPi> Zetta, you can find out which gfx card you use in a terminal with "lspci -vnn | grep VGA -A 12"
[15:11] <syntroPi> daftykins, well ok then
[15:11] <PanV> Who was the guy that was helping me today..... and where is eric..
[15:12] <lotuspsychje> PanV: Eric might went to sleep, he might be back tomorrow
[15:12] <daftykins> PanV: sounds like it'd be worth checking your hard disks health to me
[15:12] <spoonman_> hi all
[15:13] <Zetta> syntroPi, http://pastie.org/10493185
[15:13] <PanV> lotuspsychje: I was kinda joking at that one. daftykins: Disk is fine. SMART confirmed.
[15:13] <PanV> I believe hard-reboot is the problem.
[15:13] <daftykins> PanV: i'd rather see it for myself
[15:13] <PanV> daftykins: Can I check it at a liveusb?
[15:13] <daftykins> yes, "sudo apt-get install pastebinit smartmontools && sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | pastebinit"
[15:13] <spoonman_> i'm trying to install Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (64-bit) on a Dell Precision 7910.  i've enabled "legacy boot mode" and installed the OS as I usually would, but whenever I restart, I keep getting a "no boot device found" error message.  any ideas?
[15:13] <lotuspsychje> SopaXT: not sure mate i would try reinstall
[15:14] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: singleboot or dualboot?
[15:14] <spoonman_> i'm singlebooting
[15:14] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: fastboot and secreuboot disabled?
[15:14] <lotuspsychje> secureboot
[15:14] <MonkeyDust> spoonman_  did you simply copy the iso, or did you install the live session on your boot device
[15:15] <spoonman_> lotuspsychje: i did not see an option for disable fastboot.  it is set to "Thorough."  i will dbl check secureboot disabled
[15:15] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: bot must be disabled for singleboot
[15:15] <lotuspsychje> both
[15:15] <spoonman_> MonkeyDust: i burned an iso, and installed instead of "Try Ubuntu before Installing"
[15:15] <daftykins> GRUB could've gone to the wrong disk
[15:15] <SopaXT> wow!
[15:15] <SopaXT> /usr/bin/gnome-terminal.real FAILS!
[15:15] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: some bios have also deep hidden settings to block installing another Os
[15:15] <genii> spoonman_: According to http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/desktop/f/3514/t/19613159 this happens if you install to a drive connected to the SAS controller
[15:16] <SopaXT> -> I have inconsistent locale settings
[15:16] <spoonman_> genii: i saw that, but couldn't follow what they were saying
[15:17] <syntroPi> Zetta that seems to be an Arrandale first generation "HD Graphics" one. i guess you should be fine with noremal ubuntu kernel drivers then
[15:17] <PanV> spoonman_: If you are like me, you can't read tutorials.. and will probably come often to this channel.
[15:17] <spoonman_> yeah
[15:18] <genii> spoonman_: GRUB doesn't know what device driver to use for the SAS controller so it fails. Hook the drive you want to install onto into a different port
[15:18] <syntroPi> daftykins, do you know if arrandale already uses vaapi?
[15:18] <spoonman_> oh ok, i will try that
[15:18] <PanV> Does ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair fix GRUB only stuff or does stuff like dpkg?
[15:18] <spoonman_> gonna open it up now
[15:18] <daftykins> PanV: it won't help you.
[15:18] <daftykins> syntroPi: nope sorry
[15:19] <PanV> daftykins: I forgot  how to Chroot with a liveusb at my Ubuntu. I even made an article but... Dunno where is it. Do you remember the commands?
[15:19] <daftykins> !chroot
[15:19] <ubottu> A chroot is used to make programs believe that the directory they are running in is really the root directory. It can be used to stop programs accessing files outside of that directory, or for compiling 32bit applications in a 64bit environment - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicChroot
[15:19] <andybrine> Hi there everyone
[15:20] <daftykins> PanV: are you actually going to run the commands i mentioned today, or shall i leave?
[15:20] <steelbrain> Hey peeps! I am trying to get bumblebee working again after years of unsuccessful tries.
[15:20] <steelbrain> I have installed and configured most of it
[15:20] <steelbrain> but I can't get the nvidia module to not load on start.
[15:20] <PanV> daftykins: Wait, what commands?
[15:20] <daftykins> steelbrain: waste of time, it got replaced by nvidia-prime years ago.
[15:20] <steelbrain> I am using Ubuntu 14.04
[15:20] <steelbrain> daftykins: Nvidia-prime doesn't let me switch on fly
[15:21] <steelbrain> I have a laptop that lives only 2 hours on nvidia
[15:21] <daftykins> 16:13 < PanV> daftykins: Can I check it at a liveusb?
[15:21] <daftykins> 16:13 < daftykins> yes, "sudo apt-get install pastebinit smartmontools && sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | pastebinit"
[15:21] <steelbrain> and at least 4 on intel
[15:21] <syntroPi> Zetta, i never owned one of those intel graphics but you might want to read up on hw video accelleration (vaapi). "vainfo" could tell you some specs of your driver stack
[15:21] <daftykins> steelbrain: right, well bumblebee i'm pretty much sure is deprecated so gl with that
[15:21] <spoonman_> hmm, genii i don't see anything plugged into either SAS port
[15:21] <PanV> daftykins: , wait, I dont get it. What did I ask?
[15:21] <spoonman_> they are both SATA
[15:21] <steelbrain> daftykins: Is there no way to get the windows-like switching then? :(
[15:21] <daftykins> PanV: i want to see the hard disk SMART status first-hand, so run the above from the live session ¬_¬
[15:22] <daftykins> steelbrain: unlikely.
[15:22] <PanV> What postfix configuration should I choose?
[15:22] <daftykins> defaults.
[15:22] <daftykins> just hit enter :)
[15:22] <steelbrain> Pretty sad. Okay then. Thanks anyways, now I gotta undo all that
[15:22] <PanV> No configuration or local? I shouldnt move around the menus..
[15:23] <daftykins> none.
[15:23] <PanV> I chose ok.
[15:23] <PanV> System mail name?
[15:23] <daftykins> steelbrain: you should look into prime though, likely it runs as the intel mainly but you can still open a program that'll make use of the nvidia
[15:23] <proycon> Is there no nvidia-xconfig anymore in 15.10 ??
[15:23] <daftykins> PanV: doesn't matter, as i've already said
[15:23] <PanV> I hope I don't get screwed up
[15:24] <spoonman_> genii: is that link talking about disconnecting one of the SATA drives?  nothing is plugged into either SAS port
[15:24] <steelbrain> daftykins: I am not sure if that's possible, because when I change between the GPUs I have to restart to make it work, even a logout doesn't do that
[15:24] <syntroPi> Zetta, you could try something like "sudo apt-get install i965-va-driver vainfo " and then invoke "vainfo" to see which video decoding is accellerated
[15:24] <daftykins> PanV: you're in a live session, nothing you do will even last after reboot :)
[15:24] <PanV> let me copy paste the paste link
[15:24] <PanV> http://paste.ubuntu.com/12862056/
[15:24] <daftykins> steelbrain: that's for permanent switching, just read up and try :)
[15:24] <genii> spoonman_: SAS and SATA use the same plugs, you can't really tell them apart by physically looking at the cables. Just try the other plug
[15:24] <PanV> daftykins: I know, I was just afraid if it af- oh wait I am not mounted
[15:25] <genii> ( if there's only two)
[15:25] <spoonman_> genii: ok.  i can read on the MOBO where they say SATA0 SATA1 (have plugs), SAS0, SAS1 (no plugs)
[15:25] <daftykins> PanV: probably just need to fsck your disk then.
[15:25] <PanV> And by that you mean.. :P
[15:25] <daftykins> i literally mean, fsck.
[15:26] <MonkeyDust> PanV  fsck = file system check
[15:26] <daftykins> so keep the disk unmounted, then "fsck /dev/sdx#" where that's a partition on your system
[15:26] <daftykins> "sudo parted -l" to list them
[15:26] <PanV> Ok
[15:26] <daftykins> you want to check what is your / partition, likely /dev/sda1
[15:27] <daftykins> i'll bbl
[15:27] <PanV> fdisk -l it?
[15:27] <PanV> ?
[15:27] <PanV> oops
[15:28] <PanV> wait a minute.
[15:29] <PanV> http://paste.ubuntu.com/12862122/ My partition is like 100 GB, what is my partition?
[15:29] <auronandace> PanV: sda5
[15:30] <PanV> fsck /dev/sda5/?
[15:30] <Johne> can someone tell me how to find all files with a leading whitespace? google is failing me.
[15:32] <spoonman_> lotuspsychje: i cannot disable fastboot on this thing.  it only has "minimal," "thorough," and "auto" for options
[15:33] <PanV> That's the command? fsck /dev/sda5/
[15:33] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: something must be still blocking in bios mate, its the symptons of a fastboot enabled i think
[15:34] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: maybe the ##hardware guys might know wich to disable
[15:34] <spoonman_> cool, thanks
[15:34] <spoonman_> genii: in the bios, SAS RAID controller is also "Disabled"

[15:35] <lotuspsychje> !uefi | spoonman_ you might find usefull info here aswell
[15:35] <ubottu> spoonman_ you might find usefull info here aswell: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[15:35] <spoonman_> luckily, i disabled the UEFI stuff and am legacy booting  :)
[15:36] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: it mentions fastboot also
[15:36] <maddawg2> oops i messed up lol
[15:36] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: some system have also an intel thing to block new Os install, i keep forgetting its name

[15:37] <spoonman_> interesting
[15:37] <maddawg2> what is the proper way to reverse the above command
[15:37] <maddawg2> can i just delete /etc/apt/sources.list.d/owncloud.list?
[15:39] <k1l_> maddawg2: yes

[15:47] <spoonman_> lemme look
[15:48] <spoonman_> i just got this equipment assigned to me
[15:48] <RubyDZ> Hey daftykins, hope you're still around ... I just got 2 Passes on the memtest ...
[15:49] <daftykins> RubyDZ: and still no sign of anything errors wise huh? (they come up as big red lines so it's not easy to miss)
[15:49] <RubyDZ> daftykins: Nope, no errors
[15:49] <genii> spoonman_: I guess just keep us posted
[15:49] <spoonman_> lotuspsychje: i do not know how to tell :( i'm only in the bios lemme see if i can catch it rolling across the screen
[15:49] <daftykins> RubyDZ: try booting your live session again with nomodeset then
[15:49] <daftykins> !nomodeset
[15:49] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[15:50] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: whats the dell type again
[15:51] <spoonman_> precision tower 7910
[15:55] <RubyDZ> daftykins: not really sure how I should go about following the instructions in that link, I don't have Windows on the laptop I'm trying to reinstall Ubuntu on ....
[15:56] <uupz> hey
[15:56] <daftykins> RubyDZ: i don't know how you got that you'd need windows for anything, "nomodeset" is a parameter you add by booting to the menu then pressing F6 and selecting nomodeset :)
[15:57] <RubyDZ> daftykins: So now I reboot, and open BIOS and press F6?
[15:57] <spoonman_> one thing i don't get is, where do i install the bootloader?  i have /dev/sda1 set to "biosgrub" or i can choose /dev/sda
[15:57] <RubyDZ> I'm still on the memtest screen BTW
[15:57] <daftykins> RubyDZ: no F6 is on the menu when you boot ubuntu from your flash drive or DVD
[15:58] <RubyDZ> daftykins: So from the Installer Boot Menu, right? Just before it freezes on me
[15:58] <daftykins> RubyDZ: you see a little logo at the bottom, press a key and it gives you a language menu - then you will be offered to press F6 for advanced options
[15:58] <daftykins> yep
[15:58] <daftykins> spoonman_: main /dev/sda should be fine
[15:58] <RubyDZ> daftykins: K will try now
[15:59] <bos_gpc> foo

[16:01] <DrDamnit> I just fat fingered a monumental fubar moment: I chown'd /var/ to www-data. Since I am setting up Ubuntu 12 LTS, and it's not in production, I have two options... go through and re-assign ownship and permissions or reinstall. What's the better option? (I already have 4 hours of work into this thing).
[16:02] <daftykins> PanV: yes.
[16:02] <spoonman_> perfect
[16:02] <k1l_> PanV: just ask a detailed question and others can see if they can help
[16:02] <spoonman_> thanks lotuspsychje - am checking that in bios now
[16:02] <daftykins> DrDamnit: start again
[16:02] <PanV> So.. What command should I do now after knowing that my partition is /dev/sda5/?
[16:03] <DrDamnit> daftykins, yeah... I was hoping someone had a github script to un-fuck this, but that's what I figured I would have to do.
[16:03] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: play with some settings till you can install ubuntu
[16:03] <RubyDZ> daftykins: Didn't get it the way you said, but I went to Help on the Installer Boot Menu, and when I press F6 it says: This kernel requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detected an i686 CPU. Unable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU
[16:03] <PanV> DrDamnit: Language.
[16:03] <RubyDZ> daftykins: I'm guessing I've downloaded the wrong version of Ubuntu? I got the 64-bit one ... I should've gotten 32-bit, right?
[16:03] <daftykins> RubyDZ: ah so it's that your system is too old for 64-bit :) you will need to download the 32-bit version and try again
[16:03] <Guest49209> Hey guys I wanted to ask, is Ubunto Mate a good distro for a noobie ?
[16:03] <DrDamnit> Apologies. Couldn't think of a G-rated version of what I did.
[16:04] <DrDamnit> thanks everyone. Off to re-install.
[16:04] <daftykins> RubyDZ: however, 15.10 will be out in a few days, so if you have 15.04 there you might want to just wait / grab the 15.10 media
[16:04] <daftykins> Guest49209: sure
[16:04] <PanV> brb
[16:05] <RubyDZ> daftykins: Hmmm. How many days is that? 'Cause I right now want to have Ubuntu on this old netbook to have a backup for if my Windows 10 upgrade backfires on my day-to-day usage laptop ...
[16:05] <spoonman_> thanks for the help, lotuspsychje
[16:05] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: np, hope it helps
[16:06] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: try fastboot:minimal uefi:disabled and atm disabled
[16:06] <spoonman_> lotuspsychje: what's atm
[16:06] <Guest49209> Thanks for the response, and to what distro should I go for further experience ?
[16:07] <lotuspsychje> spoonman_: that intel active management
[16:07] <spoonman_> i couldn't find that in the bios manual.  wonder if it's not installed
[16:07] <daftykins> RubyDZ: well you could install it from a disc today then update to final when it goes final before the end of the month - i think on an old netbook you'll want to pick lubuntu though, not standard ubuntu
[16:08] <RubyDZ> daftykins: I had Ubuntu on it earlier, why should I pick lubuntu and what's the difference
[16:08] <daftykins> lubuntu is lighter and will run with less resources
[16:08] <RubyDZ> daftykins: K thanks
[16:08] <daftykins> so it'll be easier to deal with on a horrid netbook that is fit for burial at sea :)
[16:09] <RubyDZ> It's not a horrid netbook xD It's a 2010/2011 model and perfectly fine except needs a battery and charger replacement xD
[16:09] <daftykins> all netbooks were horrid on their day of creation :)

[16:15] <hamza_> hi, anyway i can disable ubuntu's unity-screen-panel from controling my resolution? it seems to add offset whenever it finds two display with different sizes, i.e it applies this resolution to a 28" monitor to make it "seamless" with my old 26": 1920x1080+0+41
[16:15] <RubyDZ> Guys, I came across something called MacBuntu, anyone have an idea what that is? Seems to be a mix of hackintosh/linux?
[16:16] <compdoc> doesnt sound official
[16:17] <daftykins> RubyDZ: probably just an ubuntu with a skin or theme to make it look like a mac

[16:25] <RubyDZ> daftykins: just a Q about lubuntu, my understanding is that since it requires fewer resources, that will mean my netbook will run faster than usual, right? Also, is Google Chrome supported?

[16:27] <daftykins> RubyDZ: yes and yes
[16:27] <qstrahl> RubyDZ, Also the difference with lubuntu is likely not that huge but yes they do put a focus on using less resources in general... you are more likely to get less bloat on your disk than a "faster" experience though

[16:44] <stuentttet> daftykins:  yes, nothing happends. In mac OS it doesnt recognize the disk either
[16:44] <daftykins> hmm ok, if you used 'dd' are you sure you used the main disk device and not a partition?
[16:44] <stuentttet> yes i am sure
[16:44] <daftykins> i understand disk naming under OS X is very different
[16:45] <stuentttet> I did everything according to the link
[16:45] <stuentttet> 1054867456 bytes transferred in 85.068227 secs (12400252 bytes/sec)
[16:45] <daftykins> and what is the ISO you obtained?
[16:45] <stuentttet> ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64 that I transformed to .img like the manual said
[16:46] <stuentttet> .img.dmg apple added the .dmg
[16:46] <daftykins> i would try using dd on the iso direct to the disk device without conversion
[16:46] <daftykins> or just borrow another system temporarily
[16:48] <stuentttet> okay I will try to transfer .iso directly but seems weird
[16:48] <daftykins> that's macs for you :) which model is it?
