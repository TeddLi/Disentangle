[11:20] <meowbuntu> indus, is tehre a better application than f-spot then
[11:20] <RedNifre> Hidden folders start with a dot, right? If I want to hide a folder do I just change it from "foo" to ".foo"? And will programs that reference it still be able to find it? Is "/foo/" the same location as "/.foo/" or will I have to modify all programs that reference it?
[11:20] <switchgirl> indus: lookat the code of conduct and think how the phrase "nice for a womans distro" could contravine that

[11:21] <indus> switchgirl, iam not sure what you aer talking about
[11:21] <airtonix> switchgirl, .... /headdesk
[11:21] <switchgirl> it comes across as sexist
[11:21] <indus> switchgirl, misunderstanding?
[11:21] <RedNifre> which distro is for women?
[11:21] <indus> lets get back to topic
[11:21] <switchgirl> no i understood you perfectly.
[11:22] <meowbuntu> RedNifre, you may have to midify al the programs yes as they aill be set to look for /foo/ not /.foo/

[11:24] <switchgirl> it connects but circles for AGES
[11:24] <indus> switchgirl, strange irony, ubuntu is for all, then you have a women's channel
[11:24] <switchgirl> and i have no messages

[11:27] <switchgirl> its BETtA
[11:27] <switchgirl> :P
[11:28] <ActionParsnip> yo yo yo
[11:28] <airtonix> switchgirl, so you've tried both those options? then i would try running thunderbird from terminal so that you get some feedback from the terminal stdout...maybe it gives something to indicate why you can not recieve mail ?

[11:30] <switchgirl> ok airtonix

[11:31] <ActionParsnip> [V13]Axel: he left after saying hi, quite funny
[11:31] <mandrkldf33833> in windows there are applications which are portable, e.g. vlc portable, firefox portable. those apps can be extracted to hard disk and start without installing. is there something for ubuntu, too?
[11:31] <ActionParsnip> marcobxbro1: you can run those portable apps in wine (so i've heard)
[11:31] <airtonix> mandrkldf33833, yes.
[11:32] <Stargaze> mandrkldf33833, try 'Portable Ubuntu'
[11:32] <airtonix> mandrkldf33833, i think you'll find that those two apps you mention are actually portable by nature when you download them from teh mozilla site
[11:32] <ActionParsnip> Stargaze: is portable ubuntu official by canonical?
[11:33] <[V13]Axel> ActionParsnip: Really? Wow. I don't get any notifications on ChatZilla. I don't have mIRC yet on this computer.
[11:33] <prisko> ciao
[11:33] <switchgirl> airtonix: i'd prefer not to use the old one as its rubbish imho
[11:33] <DJones> mandrkldf33833: WIth Ubuntu, you have an option to have a live usb install with full apps for firefox & vlc installed so that you can just boot on any computer capeable of USB boot and run your own personal version of ubuntu
[11:33] <airtonix> mandrkldf33833, another one that is portable is floola
[11:34] <airtonix> switchgirl, up to you really... but since its beta software and you're having issues, one can only come to a two way descision : a) keep using it and help debug the problem with reports to mozilla or b) use the version you know work
[11:35] <ShapeShifter499> hi
[11:35] <mandrkldf33833> thx for the answers, but actually what i am looking for is the exact equivalent of vlc portable for ubuntu. so if i run ubuntu and have no admin rights, why not download a programm, extract it like vlc portable for windows and start this program.
[11:36] <elgh> Does anyone know how to turn Vsync off in Ubuntu=
[11:36] <ActionParsnip> [V13]Axel: i use irssi now and it tells you ;)

[11:37] <ActionParsnip> indus: yo yo yo
[11:37] <FireCrotch> mandrkldf33833: if you have the vlc binary, it *should* in theory just run on any ubuntu system, provided the system has the required dependencies and is the same version of ubuntu

[11:39] <kslen> how is ubuntu 10.04 lts performance wise for you guys? switching between directories regardless of the file manager is uber uber slow.
[11:39] <ShapeShifter499> died....um it shut off with no warning and would not turn back on

[11:44] <chiiiiiz>  I have an old Nvidia 6700XL (PCI-X 128 Mo video). Is there any problem using it on a AMD based motherboard with an Athlon x4??? Or would it be better to use an Intel based MB, or to buy an ATI (ATI + ubuntu == problems)
=== rainofkayos is now known as SolarisBoy
[11:44] <kinja-sheep> chiiiiiz: #hardware ? :)
[11:44] <[V13]Axel> Claws: You might want to clarify. VirtualBox is better, easier to install, better GUI. I'm gonna go with ActionParsnip here, install to a USB flash drive, it's a true install that doesn't require splitting resources.
[11:44] <kinja-sheep> or #hardwares (either way).
[11:44] <ActionParsnip> chiiiiiz: should be fine, nvidia are very supported
[11:44] <FireCrotch> chiiiiiz: off topic, but I see no reason that it wouldn't work just fine
[11:44] <the_gamer> what is the difference between aptitude remove and aptitude reinstall? i want to remove all configfiles with erasing the program
[11:45] <kinja-sheep> the_gamer: aptitude purge
[11:45] <chiiiiiz> NO I thought that AMD only or better works with ATI...
[11:45] <chiiiiiz> Going to #hardware!!
[11:45] <chiiiiiz> thanks anyway
[11:45] <ActionParsnip> the_gamer: remove removes the app, reinstall redownloads the deb and install sit over the top of whats installed
[11:45] <the_gamer> kinja-sheep, thanks
[11:45] <the_gamer> ActionParsnip, thanks
[11:46] <indus> when is international mens day
[11:46] <[V13]Axel> Aptitude reinstall simply uninstalls and reinstalls the basic program. Remove removes the program but not settings. Purge gets rid of all setting files as well.
[11:46] <airtonix> indus, next friday
[11:46] <ActionParsnip> the_gamer: could use: sudo apt-get --purge remove packagename    and it will remove the app and its config
[11:46] <Stargaze> the_gamer, type aptitude in a Terminal

[11:49] <FireCrotch> ActionParsnip: Erlang is a programming language
[11:49] <[V13]Axel> ActionParsnip: Erlang is a general purpose, cuncurrent programming language and runtime system. It's almost like java, except for it isn't object-oriented.

[11:57] <[V13]Axel> Weird question. My Computer Engineering Tech 2 teacher allows us to bring in USB bootable operating systems to demonstrate for the class. Would there be any way to log onto my school network via Ubuntu?
[11:58] <ActionParsnip> [V13]Axel: you will be able to logon with the local accounts just fine, you may need to add proxy settings if the network uses them and / or add the system to the domain

[11:58] <ActionParsnip> [V13]Axel: take in xpud too, watch those windows users jaws drop :)
[11:58] <mopad> erUSUL: because it doesnt work. i have a -real- ubuntu 9.10 install and use the nvidia driver..but sometimes i have to run it through VirtualBox which needs manual xorg.conf modifications to use >800*600 resolutions

[11:58] <[V13]Axel> ActionParsnip: What about onto the network as a user? Xpud?
[11:58] <ActionParsnip> [V13]Axel: xpud boots faster than most crt monitors can warm up
[11:59] <Stargaze> what's xpud?
[11:59] <[V13]Axel> What is it? Is it an OS or is it something for Ubuntu?
[11:59] <ActionParsnip> [V13]Axel: you dont have to log on as a network user, just use the local accounts
[11:59] <ActionParsnip> [V13]Axel: its a VERY stripped down Linux distro
[11:59] <[V13]Axel> Ah. Kinda like DSL?
[11:59] <ActionParsnip> [V13]Axel: boots faster and has less
[12:00] <[V13]Axel> Ah. Hm. I may just do that one day. ^_^

=== Guest85189 is now known as Nijverheid
[12:03] <ActionParsnip> UpgradingUser: upgrade keeps settings and stuff, less work. clean install will give a nice clean system without all the old fluff from the old install, you may lose some settings (especially if you do not have a separate /home partition)
[12:03] <bloodbender> hey
[12:04] <ActionParsnip> UpgradingUser: some users have issues after upgrades which are cured with a clean install, its a bit of a mixed bag really
[12:04] <UpgradingUser> ActionPasnip: What about the change from EXT3 to EXT4? Think its a good idea to upgrade that too? I need to read more about the Filesystems.

[12:17] <smiler> After installing ruby1.9.1 I don't have any ruby executable in my system but rather a ruby1.9.1 executable. This causes scripts that depend on an existing ruby executable that actually has the name "ruby" to fail. Is there any ubuntuish way around this or should I just symlink the stuff manually?

[12:33] <indus> ShapeShifter499, the problem could be heat
[12:33] <Dr_Willis> ShapeShifter499:  could be the power supply, or any of a dozen other things.

[13:28] <ruien> crackguy: "ls" is often considered a command, but it's a program too. Where to draw the line makes what you're asking for difficult to specify.

[13:37] <jiohdi> jcrawford: not an expert, but it sounds like your kernel did not compile correctly and needs to be reconfigured
[13:37] <E-TARD> is it in pfl
[13:37] <AceKing> madalin, nibbler, I still can't seem to get in to the folder. What exactly do I have type to get in the folder?
[13:38] <brah-> gol'd technology
[13:38] <nibbler_> AceKing, ok, your are right there. the folder belongs to root, and only root can execute (enter) it. so do "sudo -i" and become root, then use nano to edit the file. our first approch was not wise, sorry
[13:39] <AceKing> nibbler, Thank you for explaining!

[14:08] <jiohdi> JPSman: under STAT you should find Rl for running program
[14:09] <nibbler_> mattgyver, only if its a mirror setup and if you stop the raid meanwhile. otherwise it will need to resync
=== Gast389254 is now known as _raven_
[14:10] <mattgyver> nibbler_, yeah it is a mirror setup.  Would it be best to just image the disk and wipe the drive then so it completely resyncs everything properly?

[14:11] <ginbuntu> hi, I have file sharing turned on. but it only share files which  have permission 755. when ever I put new files into the shared folder it is not visible on my other pc. I have to change it manually to 755. is there a way to change the permission automatically to 755 whenever I copy/create files in this folder?
[14:11] <nibbler_> yep :p very scary
[14:11] <jalons> Are teh files really modified that often that you need to do that?
[14:11] <mattgyver> nibbler_, jalons i was gonna just use clonezilla however it doesnt support a way to image a software raid1, do you guys know another way?
[14:11] <nibbler_> mattgyver, why not just make the backup via the network?

[14:12] <red> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8934399
[14:12] <nibbler_> mattgyver, just use rsync -a  - if you have productive systems running like databases, do the rsync, to it again, stop the db, do it again, start the db, gives you downtime of less than 1 minute (i assume)
[14:13] <nibbler_> mattgyver, these files will also be suitable for disaster recovery... just make sure to not include /proc and /sys in the backup :)
[14:13] <SolarisBoy> hmm

[14:13] <mattgyver> nibbler_, cool that sounds like a good idea I will deffinately look into that
[14:14] <mattgyver> nibbler_, i do have db's running so i could just stop the db first right and just run it once correct?
[14:14] <kingfishr> This is probably hopeless, but is there any way to have ubuntu keep track of packages I specifically install (as opposed to others that are pulled in as deps)? I'd like to apt-get autoremove without getting rid of all the libs I installed manually for software I custom compiled.
[14:14] <SolarisBoy> mattgyver: what is your goal?
[14:14] <nibbler_> mattgyver, sure, just stop them before, if you can allow longer downtimes.
[14:14] <mattgyver> SolarisBoy, if something happens, more so related to user error, i have a file system image so i can reload it asap.
[14:15] <nibbler_> backups are a good idea anyway :)
[14:15] <SolarisBoy> ok so a bootable system image? what OS and hardware?
[14:16] <mattgyver> SolarisBoy, doesnt necessarily have to be a bootable system image really, im okay with just a partimage or clonezilla image that i can reload
[14:16] <SolarisBoy> ok
[14:17] <nibbler_> mattgyver, to be complete also backup the output of sfdisk -l and dd if=/dev/sdX count=1 bs=512

[14:50] <holzmodem> hi, I installed eclipse from the repo + the PDT plugin from eclipse.org, but I cant see/activate it
[14:51] <stevecam> madalin, sounds like your computer is.... um... dying?
[14:51] <iceroot> holzmodem: run "eclipse" from the terminal
[14:51] <madalin> stevecam: well, why ? What can i do ?
[14:52] <holzmodem> iceroot, there is noch "log" output
[14:52] <stevecam> you could have a look some logs in /var/logs, but i dont know what you should be looking for, if its rebooting it looks like something is faulty
[14:52] <iceroot> holzmodem: what?
[14:52] <madalin> stevecam: what could be faulty ? I really have NO ideea..
[14:52] <holzmodem> iceroot, I started eclipse from the terminal
[14:53] <holzmodem> I aready checked "Help > Install New Software", PDT is marked as installed
[14:54] <stevecam> this is just a guess, but your hard drive has problems with it causing it to make the computer freak out and reboot

[14:54] <madalin> stevecam: how can i check that?

[15:04] <jalons> ok, I have 4 monitors connected to 2 nvidia cards - nvidia detects all 4 screens, however it's forcing one screen to a lower resolution (I figure I can fix this with some tweaks to xorg.conf later), however how does one identify which screen ubuntu considers Screen0, Screen1, etc so I can configure proper positioning?

[15:56] <mouse> chili555, I've had quite a few problems.  I updated ubuntu two weekends ago and it asked me to restart.  I did so and I got a disk check screen everytime.  It wouldn't ever give the option to load an os.  So I reinstalled then nautilus stopped working.  As in I couldn't access my trash or computer or network and so on.  I reinstalled again and decided to be very careful with what updates I install now.  Then on my main computer wubi sto
[15:56] <mouse> pped working after I updated ubuntu there.  I uninstalled then reinstalled and it won't load the kernel for ubuntu.  I keep getting the message error: no loaded kernel.  I followed directions here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Rescue to attempt to boot the os but nothing worked.  In short, I would like to know, what is the most stable linux distro?  I'm not ready to give up yet.

[15:58] <Sevillahk> hi, can i know how to get drivers for a Ati hd5650?
[15:58] <Alice_32> <blakkheim> i wrote letter to ati today i bought laptop paid for it a lot of money and the seller told me that ati today is better then nvidia so i didnt care really thought will work it was little mistake i think:)

[15:58] <Bisu[Shield]> wheere would i find libphp5.so
[15:58] <chili555> mouse, i am sure we are all biased, but IMO, Ubuntu is the most stable. i have no experience with Wubi, so I can't really comment there. when I have done clean installs on formatted drives, it just works fine for me
[15:59] <TudeLa> Stargaze: thanks youu =)
[15:59] <chili555> mouse, maybe a Wubi guru can help from here

[15:59] <Sevillahk> I installed a version of drivers that ubuntu said me, but when ir reset the computer appear a text "Unsupportable Hardware"
[16:00] <Stargaze> chili555, wubi is a pseudo-installation within Windows
[16:00] <mouse> chili555, I'm very envious.  I love ubuntu, when it works but I seem to have a very bad run of luck when it comes to linux.
[16:00] <chili555> Stargaze, i have no windows here, so i am not able to help poor mouse
[16:01] <Stargaze> mouse, wubi is a pseudo-installation within Windows
[16:01] <SamuelPeterson> I'm having issues with modify grub.cfg. It wont let me save even when I'm root. I want to simply remove quiet splash and put in debug because I have random boot issues.
[16:02] <Bisu[Shield]> anyone
[16:02] <usr13> SamuelPeterson: sudo vi /boot/grub/grub.cfg
[16:03] <Stargaze> idd, but i was going to advice nano, not vi
[16:03] <mouse> stargaze, yes it is.  I'm not proud of it but I do need windows since linux has so many problems running commercial games.  When valve starts making games for linux I will gladly remove my windows partition.
[16:03] <Stargaze> mouse, check this link => http://users.skynet.be/gbachot/html/games.html
[16:05] <Stargaze> mouse, it's not linux's fault, if developpers won't port their games to linux
[16:05] <budo> need assistance, java is installed, yet the iceweasel brower not pickin it up
[16:06] <Trek> budo: make sure you have the plugin installed, its a separate package
[16:06] <damian> I'm job hunting online, and I'm getting a Internet Explorer required to view the application, is there any way to get around this without installing IE? X_x
[16:07] <budo> okay, thank you
[16:07] <Stargaze> damian, some browsers do imitate IE, with a plugin or so
[16:08] <mneptok> mouse: install Ubuntu into its own partition carved from free space in your Windows partition. Wubi is not something i would use or recommend.
[16:08] <zinox> why developpers should care about games for linux if video cards on linux has a crap driver support? leak of standardization too.. will take a long time until Linux reaches a level acceptable for production and development Games
[16:08] <damian> well, so far I've tried firefox, Opera with the IE setting, SeaMonkey, and Conquerer without success :(
[16:09] <mouse> stargaze, no need to take offense.  I don't hold linux developers responsible for it.  If anything it's the everyday casual user that wants emails and youtube but doesn't want to actually learn anything.  If game designers would open their doors to the linux platform, all other OSes would fall.
[16:09] <DodoBird> zinox: They generally shouldn't, and most won't until we see better hardware support, likely as the result of some large company throwing its weight behind making Linux desktop viable for everyday home use.
[16:09] <mouse> mneptok, What do you suggest?
[16:09] <zinox> sure
[16:10] <Stargaze> mouse, idd, it is said that consultants never recommend Linux, because they would lose their jobs, as Linux has fewer issues than Windows
[16:10] <purpzey> Can someone help out to umount a folder, I accidentally mounted it from the local machine using NFS, and when I go to umount it I get "device is busy" but if I run fuser I don't get any process
=== Guest11795 is now known as isp
[16:11] <nibbler_> purpzey, use lsof | grep /mountpoint
[16:11] <mneptok> mouse: use Windows to create free space out of unused space on your disk. then boot from the Ubuntu CD/DVD and partition and format that free space, and install to it.
[16:11] <mouse> stargaze, game designers aren't making games for linux because windows is more buggy?  That doesn't make sense.
[16:12] <Stargaze> mouse, i'm not talking about games, but the system in general
[16:12] <mneptok> mouse: game designers follow the market share, no matter how buggy it is.
[16:12] <siropio> hi i have installes successfully XAMPP at ubuntu 9.10 and i make the htdocs to be public not only for root but when i try to run a php file that i know is right it doesnt.any ideas?
[16:12] <purpzey> nibbler_: I ran that command, and it didn't unmount the dir, then I tried umount and I still got device is busy, am I missing something?
[16:12] <Stargaze> ID no longer ports its games to Linux, i guess because of the smaller marketshare
[16:13] <mouse> stargaze, sorry I misunderstood what you meant.
[16:13] <nibbler_> purpzey, the command i gave you should show you processes accessing the share, these have to be stopped/killed
[16:13] <purpzey> nibbler_: It didn't display anything.
[16:13] <mouse> mneptok, is there a tool you suggest I should use?
[16:13] <nibbler_> purpzey, you used your mountpoint instead of "mountpoint"?
[16:14] <usr13> purpzey: Edit /etc/fstab
[16:14] <purpzey> nibbler_: I used sudo mount
[16:14] <nibbler_> usr13, how is this supposed to help?
[16:14] <mneptok> mouse: for ... ?
[16:14] <usr13> purpzey: Or just review it?
[16:14] <usr13> nibbler_: Not sure really.
[16:14] <nibbler_> purpzey, lets say your mountpoint is /mnt, so use: sudo lsof  |grep /mnt
[16:14] <purpzey> nibbler_: Oh oh, yes...I did lsof | grep /home/mountpoint
[16:15] <nibbler_> purpzey, and maybe prepend sudo, i'm not sure if this is needed :\
[16:15] <resolver> an anyone tell me if its possible...i want to create a separate partition for /home so that when i have to format my system due to crashes....i'll then mount it at root...my root size will be 10Gb and the /home partition will be containing more that 20Gb...will that cause any problem as I am going to mount a bigger partition
[16:15] <purpzey> nibbler_: I didn't do it as sudo let me try that, kk.
[16:15] <mneptok> resolver: no.
[16:15] <Lord-Readman> the left idea is taking a pounding http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/23899/

=== cece is now known as verycoldnow
[16:16] <resolver> mneptok; then what could be the solution
[16:16] <Stargaze> resolver, my root is also 10 and my /home is 125GB, no problems there
=== katie11 is now known as k[a]tie
[16:16] <mneptok> resolver: solution to what?
[16:16] <nibbler_> purpzey, anyways, you can always try: sudo umount -f /home/mountpoint    -  but try other approaches first.
[16:17] <mouse> mneptok, it sounds like you're suggesting I unpartition part of windows then boot into this free space and install ubuntu within it.  If this is the basic idea then I do not know how or have the tools to do it.
[16:17] <usr13> resolver: You can put your /home on as big a  partition as you want.
[16:17] <purpzey> nibbler_: "warning can't stat() fuser.gvfs-fuser-daemon" (or something similar)
[16:17] <resolver> mneptok; i am going to create a partition and then I want to mount it and use it just the same way i use a /home
[16:17] <otswim> hello, which ubuntu package should i download to get the package algorithm for latex?
[16:17] <Dr_Willis> Lord-Readman:  buttons on the left.. Yes. I see that as a not popular idea
[16:18] <Stargaze> !latex

[16:18] <resolver> Stargaze; i am talking about mounting a new partition on a partition which is of lower size
[16:18] <Lord-Readman> Dr_Willis, alot of people voting to change them back to the right
[16:18] <zinox> you can install ubuntu using colinux
[16:18] <Dr_Willis> Lord-Readman:  makes you wonder who voted to move them. :)
[16:18] <mouse> mneptok, vista unfortunately.
[16:19] <pondu> ciao
[16:19] <Lord-Readman> noone saddly
[16:19] <mouse> zinox, thank you.
[16:19] <usr13> resolver: You can not "mount a new partition on a partition which is of lower size".
[16:19] <Stargaze> Portable Ubuntu is more userfriendly and based on colinux
[16:19] <nibbler_> purpzey, ok, the gvfs is not related to your problem. no other output? try sudo umount -f
[16:19] <purpzey> nibbler_: sudo umount -f /mount/point ?
[16:19] <usr13> resolver: You need free space to create the new partition on.  Or, you need another HD.
[16:19] <nibbler_> purpzey, yep
[16:20] <usr13> resolver: Alternately, you can re-size other partitions and make room for another.

[16:21] <resolver> usr13; since you said its not possible...i am thinking of an alternative
[16:21] <qwe> or i must download new drivers
[16:22] <usr13> purpzey: "Device or resuource busy", when trying to mount a device, usually means it is already mounted.  mount

[16:24] <Dr_Willis> hekin:  clarify what you mean.
[16:24] <usr13> purpzey, see private message
[16:24] <nibbler_> hekin, CPUs should not be spinning, try to fix it better! or use top or system monitor to see what is happening
[16:24] <usr13> nibbler_: I know.
[16:24] <mouse> zinox, I would agree with you except the drivers were up to date.  Fallout 3 wouldn't run with wine either.
[16:24] <Dr_Willis> Stargaze:  you are running the tool as your main user who has full sudo rights? You dident set a root password did you?
[16:24] <usr13> nibbler_: Tell him to check and see if he is not accessing it from another terminal.
[16:24] <hekin> Dr_Willis, nibbler_, there's no such a process possessing a huge slice of CPU resource

[16:25] <Stargaze> Dr_Willis, is it with sudo su?
[16:25] <purpzey> usr13, nibbler_: I don't know what terminal was accessing it b/c I only had one open, but somehow the cd and then the umount worked.

[16:36] <ASULutzy> hekin: Well, it will give you the temps of your CPU, and then you can go from there. Generally you can adjust fan settings in the BIOS. I actually don't know a "speedfan" sort of app for Ubuntu, but I'm sure there is one.
[16:36] <hekin> Trek, thanks for the advice
[16:36] <h00k> Dr_Willis: if you're using ctrl+alt+arrow to switch screens?
[16:36] <Trek> hekin: easier solution?  call Dell, say "the CPU fan sounds like its working too hard, and the system is just idle.  whats going on?"
[16:37] <aetcore> Does anyone else know about Sound on a iMac 24inch?
[16:37] <Trek> hekin: they ask "what OS you using?"  you tell them, "does it matter?"

[16:37] <laron> whats the difference berween ubuntu server serving openssh and running gnome, and ubuntu desktop serving openssh?
[16:37] <hekin> Trek, actually, the tech support even didn't heard of Ubuntu before
[16:37] <sloopy> mrdk, /dev/men ?
[16:37] <Trek> hekin: so you say "Linux" instead of Ubuntu
[16:37] <Dr_Willis> h00k:  we are refering to a Syngery issue. With Syngery a 'screen' is actrually on a different PC. Not virtual desktops on a single pc
[16:37] <CardinalFang> Dr_Willis, me either.  No one does that, AFAIK.  That's not the cause.
[16:38] <mrdk> sloopy, yes I think it was that I guess
[16:38] <Dr_Willis> CardinalFang:  thats what im reading 0 is how they seem to  be able to 'make it happen' but  I could be missreading
[16:38] <sloopy> mrdk, sure it wasnt /dev/mem ?
[16:38] <h00k> Dr_Willis: ah, I just saw the 'why would I be pressing' keys comment. I'm familiar with synergy.
[16:38] <hekin> Trek, yes, I told them it's a distro of Linux, but they said they were not familiar with it
[16:38] <jimcooncat> laron, not a lot of difference -- I believe the kernel scheduler uses a different method
[16:38] <Trek> hekin: then Dell is idiotic beyond my own beliefs...
[16:38] <micr0x> hey guys, each time I try to suspend my system, it goes to screensaver, but doesn't suspend, any reasons why?\
[16:38] <mrdk> sloopy, possibly yeah... not sure tho
[16:39] <Dr_Willis> CardinalFang:  i do just use synegery to controll the 'video player pc' mainly. So it dosent get heavy ussage from me much
[16:39] <CardinalFang> Dr_Willis, there is no reliable way to make it happen.  I can be typing in the 'client' anD SUDDENLY SHIFT IS LOCKED ON>
=== ryan_ is now known as ryandaum
[16:39] <usr13> mrdk: What was the original problem?
[16:39] <laron> ok, thanks
[16:39] <CardinalFang> Or Super or Ctrl.
[16:39] <hekin> Trek, lol
[16:39] <Dr_Willis> CardinalFang:  never seen that happen.
[16:39] <jimcooncat> laron, there might be differences in the gnome setup as well -- depends on how gnome was installed on the server machine
[16:39] <ASULutzy> mrdk, sloopy, usr13: There is no problem that that would be an appropriate solution for.
[16:39] <CardinalFang> Dr_Willis, Great.
[16:39] <mrdk> usr13, firefox crashed on websites like youtube and myspace
[16:39] <mouse> I'm sure the answer is yes but is it possible to dual boot ubuntu and mint?
[16:39] <sloopy> ASULutzy, yeah i think someone was screwing with him(or her)
[16:39] <demonspork_> mouse, yes
[16:39] <CardinalFang> Hrm, I haven't tried x2x in *years*.
[16:40] <Trek> hekin: I usually tell them when there's an issue with my laptop, "I put linux on, I made sure it works, now address the HARDWARE issue at hand, as I know the drivers and what not are not the issue."
[16:40] <laron> k
[16:40] <usr13> mrdk: I'm not sure what echo cat /dev /urandom > /dev/men > /etc/bash/bashrc  was supposed to do for you????
[16:40] <craig_gnome> !lm-sensors
[16:40] <ubottu> To access CPU temperature sensors and detect fan speeds, install the lm-sensors package. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SensorInstallHowto for installation and usage instructions.
[16:40] <usr13> mrdk: Sounds like you had a problem with flash
[16:40] <Trek> hekin: or, I just say, "Let me speak to either your supervisor or the next-level technician"
[16:40] <demonspork_> mouse, the Ubuntu installer should recognize any existing installation (especially if it is booting with grub) and automatically set up the dual boot.
[16:40] <mrdk> usr13: someone told me it would fix my firefox problem
[16:40] <Trek> hekin: i'm evil when I bother Dell tech support, huh?  :P
[16:41] <usr13> mrdk: Did it fix your firefox problem?
[16:41] <h00k> mrdk: it won't, no, that's actually quite a dangerous command, if done correctly.
[16:41] <mrdk> usr13: no, because I can't boot anymore...
[16:41] <hekin> Trek, you know what, I'm in China, there're nothing more evil than the tech support here
[16:41] <mrdk> h00k: what does it do?
[16:41] <usr13> mrdk: What is it doing...?
[16:41] <ASULutzy> mrdk, usr13: If you were to pipe /dev/urandom over your /etc/bash.bashrc, that would be a "bad thing".
[16:41] <Trek> hekin: too true
[16:41] <h00k> mrdk: replaces that file with random garbage.
=== grj is now known as jblew
[16:42] <mouse> demonspork_, you just helped me realize where I might have gone wrong in a problem I've been having.  You're my new best friend.
=== jblew is now known as jedrzejblew
[16:42] <ASULutzy> mrdk: If you have a live-cd, we could pastebin you a proper /etc/bash.bashrc file to restore it.
[16:42] <hiexpo> Dr_Willis, how do i configure my game pad to work here on ubuntu 9.10
[16:42] <Trek> hekin: in that case, hekin, you're stuck probably replacingi the fan yourself.  i hope you have the tech knowledge to effectively change the fan on your system, if at all possible.
[16:42] <Dr_Willis> hiexpo:  i just plug mine in and they work.
[16:42] <Stargaze> demonspork, i think that was a proposal by mouse :)
[16:42] <Dr_Willis> hiexpo:  some times in sopecific games i have to configure it.
[16:42] <mrdk> h00k: where do I get a live cd from?
[16:43] <ASULutzy> mrdk: Presumably you installed Ubuntu using one
[16:43] <h00k> mrdk: you'd have to download it, I suppose. it's the "installer" cd.
[16:43] <hekin> Trek, actually, that's the last thing i want to do right now, but thank you for the advice, really
[16:43] <usr13> mrdk: h00k Looks like ASULutzy has a pretty good suggestion.
[16:43] <hiexpo> Dr_Willis, ok thanks i will trythat
[16:43] <venom> Can anyone help me with WINE ?
[16:43] <Trek> hekin: no problem, sorry I can't be of more help
[16:43] <Stargaze> !wine| venom
[16:43] <ubottu> venom: WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux - More information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine - Search the !AppDB for application compatibility ratings - Join #winehq for application help - See !virtualizers for running Windows (or another OS) inside Ubuntu
[16:43] <h00k> usr13: yes, I saw that.
[16:44] <Dr_Willis> hiexpo:  makes me wonder what you tried... befor asking.. :)
[16:44] <koltroll> Where can I keep track on up coming ubuntu versions? Information about the next one and so on?
[16:44] <hiexpo> i didnt see it when i plugged it in
[16:44] <mouse> stargaze, that sure was.  I can tell from here demonspork is a real hotty.
[16:44] <ASULutzy> mrdk: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/391159/ Here's a copy of my /etc/bash.bashrc, feel free to copy over yours with it
[16:44] <mrdk> alright, I still got an old suse cd, would that work?
[16:44] <prisko__> !ciao
[16:44] <Stargaze> koltroll, check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidReleaseSchedule
[16:44] <Dr_Willis> koltroll:  ubuntu.com and about every ubuntu-related web site out there has news/articals on whats new

[16:45] <h00k> !release | koltroll
[16:45] <ubottu> koltroll: Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months. Each version is supported for 18 months to 5 years. More info at http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases & http://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases
[16:45] <mrdk> ASULutzy: alright, but I can't boot my pc :/. How can I edit that file?
[16:45] <koltroll> thanks StanManCan h00k
[16:45] <mycomp> do u know the next release name?
[16:45] <h00k> !lucid | mycomp
[16:45] <ubottu> mycomp: Lucid Lynx is the codename for Ubuntu 10.04, due April 29th, 2010 - Lucid is NOT released and is NOT stable - Discussion and support only in #ubuntu+1
[16:45] <mrdk> ASULutzy: is vi an editor?
[16:46] <mycomp> ok thanks
[16:46] <ASULutzy> mrdk: Use a live-cd of some kind. The Ubuntu installer CD would work. You'd want to boot off the live-cd, then mount the filesystem, then edit /etc/bash.bashrc to contain the contents of that pastebin. And yes, vi is an editor.
[16:47] <mrdk> ASULutzy: ok, I'm already trying to boot the cd
[16:47] <mrdk> DAMN I FIXED IT!!
[16:47] <mouse> Does anyone know a good tutorial for making a .txt file script that runs in terminal?
[16:48] <Souljah> txt file script?
[16:48] <ASULutzy> mrdk: I'm not sure what the rules are on the ubuntu forums, but whoever told you to do that was clearly being malicious. You should PM a moderator or something about it; we don't need malicious users trying to hose up peoples' systems.
[16:48] <Stargaze> mouse, try a .sh file
[16:48] <nibbler_> mouse, maybe google for "bash howto"
[16:48] <Madwill> if i already have a apache installed for php can i use the same installation for a java web app ?
[16:49] <mrdk> ASULutzy: I did, but after two PMs noone wrote back..
[16:50] <trijntje> Hi all, how can I get an iPod nano 4th generation to sync files with rhythmbox? The iPods sees the music files as 'additional software' and wont play
[16:50] <mrdk> ASULutzy: would a zfs rollback work?
[16:51] <h00k> Madwill: yes.
[16:51] <mouse> what malicious information was mrdk given?
[16:51] <dj_segfault> trijntje: Rythmobx doesn'
[16:51] <usr13> trijntje: I have sansa :)
[16:51] <Stargaze> trijntje, lees dit => http://tweakers.net/nieuws/66032/ubuntu-1004-krijgt-muziekwinkel-en-iphone-ondersteuning.html
[16:51] <h00k> mouse: a command to hose important settings.
[16:51] <ASULutzy> mrdk: Maybe? I don't use ZFS :P
[16:51] <ASULutzy> mouse: Someone on the forums told him to cat /dev/urandom over his /etc/bash.bashrc file
[16:52] <dj_segfault> trijntje: Rhythmbox doesn't truly sync, you're just copying files on to it.  Try Banshee
[16:52] <terti-us> I'm trying to install the new intel video drivers (2.10).  Having trouble
[16:52] <h00k> dj_segfault: sure it does.
[16:52] <Letatcest> talking about rythmbox,
[16:52] <dj_segfault> h00k: Mkay, haven't looked at it in a little while.  Sorry
[16:52] <mouse> Is that similar to deleting system32?
[16:53] <FirstSgt2> How do I change my DNS?
[16:53] <h00k> mouse: er. kinda.
[16:53] <Letatcest> why does the jamendo store not  play?
[16:53] <trijntje> dj_segfault, will banshee work with 4th generation iPod nano's?
[16:53] <Letatcest> or do i not understand jamendo?
[16:53] <dj_segfault> FirstSgt2: /etc/resolv.cong
[16:53] <h00k> Letatcest: Jamendo is a music store
[16:53] <justin_> non mi funziona bene compiz
[16:53] <Letatcest> yes, I know,
[16:54] <Stargaze> trijntje, did you read the webpage i showed you?
[16:54] <dj_segfault> trijntje: You can check the website, but I thought it worked with anything but itouch and iphone
[16:54] <Letatcest> but magnatune works without paying
[16:54] <ASULutzy> FirstSgt2: You'll want to use resolvconf, if you edit /etc/resolv.conf by hand, your changes will be overwritten by NetworkManager or other programs
