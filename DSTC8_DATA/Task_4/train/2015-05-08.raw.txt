[16:37] <Nexususus> I mean, don't get me wrong, I see the point of an LTS, I wouldn't use one, but I do see the point.  But having to reinstall every 9 months or so is a bit of a pain.
[16:37] <TomyWork> you can first of all try logging in as another user and see if that user's firefox works on those pages
[16:37] <abdel> PICI how can i use a GUI
[16:37] <TomyWork> General-Nemo ^
[16:37] <abdel> cos the terminal is confusing me
[16:37] <Pici> abdel: I don't know where those things are in the gui... maybe someone else can provide that info.
[16:37] <abdel> i have source.list.save and source.list.save1
[16:37] <TomyWork> abdel Pici you can certainly use a gui editor. kdesu kwrite /etc/apt/sources.list
[16:37] <General-Nemo> I had already do this
[16:38] <Nexususus> What I don't get is once 15.04 was done and released they presumably started work on 15.10 right away, so it's a constant process anyway.  How is it different to the work required for a rolling release?
[16:38] <TomyWork> or gksu maybe, but i dont know how that works precisely
[16:38] <TomyWork> General-Nemo and, does it work on another user?
[16:39] <TomyWork> Nexususus why cant they support each version until the next LTS is released?
[16:39] <TomyWork> that's what i find annoying
[16:39] <TomyWork> and the update problems, yeah
[16:40] <abdel> am lost guys
[16:40] <TomyWork> the kubuntu 14.04 i am on right now was updated from 13.04 via 13.10.
[16:40] <ki7mt> TomyWork, abdel .. for the default GUI editor: gksudo /etc/apt/sources.list
[16:41] <Nexususus> I don't find it particualrly annoying, I just don't really get way.  Sure do a tried and tested snapshot of sid and use that as an LTS, many people use them, I do get that
[16:41] <Nexususus> *why
[16:41] <Pici> abdel: I don't know the gui, sorry. I assumed (I suppose incorrectly) that if you were installing a LAMP server that you were command line proficient.
[16:41] <TomyWork> Nexususus and now my x server keeps crashing whenever i resume from hibernation
[16:41] <General-Nemo> Re
[16:42] <TomyWork> it even crashed once when it failed to hibernate due to me forgetting to shut down a VirtualBox VM
[16:42] <lxiref> hi.. I'm running ubuntu live test. No sudo(no idiea) and problem mounting. Help
[16:42] <General-Nemo> So its not work...
[16:42] <TomyWork> General-Nemo did you try using firefox on a different user account?
[16:42] <Nexususus> TomyWork: you on the 15.04
[16:42] <Nexususus> ?
[16:42] <abdel> PICI i just follow the online instructions
[16:42] <TomyWork> Nexususus 14.04
[16:42] <Nexususus> ah, righto
[16:42] <Nexususus> lxiref: what's the issue?
[16:43] <abdel> ki7mt: i should do: sudo gksudo /etc/apt/sources.list ro just gksudo /etc/apt/sources.list
[16:43] <ki7mt> abdel, sudo
[16:43] <zykotick9> ^^ missing editor command!
[16:43] <lxiref> Nexususus: no root and problem with mounting
[16:43] <ki7mt> abdel, esither way will work, if you dont add sudo, it will ask you for your PW
[16:43] <Nexususus> TomyWork: don't get me wrong, I don't want an Arch situation where you spend more time configuring and fixing Linux than using it, but maybe an LMDE like distro, but with Ubuntu Goodness. update packs are the way forward.  1 a month?
[16:44] <Nexususus> lxiref: I know that lol, what's the actual issue
[16:44] <philip_> wat is the meaning of this System information disabled due to load higher than 4.0
[16:44] <TomyWork> ki7mt sudo AND gksudo? what?
[16:44] <lxiref> password:ubuntu for root not work, I need this to mount sdhc from sd reader.. (Do I need a drivers?)
[16:44] <lxiref> The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume read-only with the 'ro' mount option.
[16:44] <abdel> i have done it ki7mt
[16:45] <abdel> but nothing happened
[16:45] <lxiref> it also told me to do something
[16:45] <Nexususus> lxiref: you don't need root to mount that, but it's saying it's got errors
[16:45] <ki7mt> abdel, Just as a side note, I would "highly" reading through the Ubuntu Manual, as it has allot of good information for those new to the command line: https://ubuntu-manual.org/
[16:45] <Nexususus> run chkdisk in windows
[16:45] <lxiref> its new laptop lol
[16:45] <ki7mt> abdel, "highly recommend"
[16:45] <lxiref> are you telling me there is errors?
[16:46] <daftykins> lxiref: that is not how you use root.
[16:46] <daftykins> lxiref: first time using ubuntu i take it?
[16:46] <abdel> yes will do that but i need a quick fix now sir
[16:46] <lxiref> i think because there is password in windows
[16:46] <lxiref> i wrote 'su' and then ubuntu as password
[16:46] <Nexususus> it's saying the sdhc has the diry flag set, then yes
[16:46] <Nexususus> *dirty
[16:46] <lxiref> can't understand
[16:46] <daftykins> lxiref: no that's wrong. run "sudo <program>" to run it as if as root
[16:46] <TomyWork> lxiref this may be an obvious question, but did you properly shut down your windows?
[16:47] <Nexususus> TomyWork: it may be a Fast Boot issue
[16:47] <lxiref> im on ubuntu as main
[16:47] <daftykins> lxiref: but you can't mount that drive because likely you have Windows 8 and have not shutdown properly in it
[16:47] <Nexususus> that "locks" the drives
[16:47] <lxiref> ;_; im on live test
[16:47] <lxiref> what is it shutdown properly?
[16:47] <lxiref> might be.. a lot restarts
[16:47] <TomyWork> lxiref the good old pre-win8 way
[16:47] <lxiref> :(
[16:47] <lxiref> so i need to buy new HDD?
[16:47] <TomyWork> no?
[16:48] <lxiref> to format windows?
[16:48] <Nexususus> I always turn Fast Boot off if I'm dual booting, gets annoying
[16:48] <daftykins> lxiref: wow where are you getting these crazy leaps in logic from? you just need to shutdown out of Windows 8 properly.
[16:48] <abdel> abdel@abdel-HP-Pavilion-dv6-Notebook-PC:~$ gksudo /etc/apt/sources.list
[16:48] <abdel> abdel@abdel-HP-Pavilion-dv6-Notebook-PC:~$
[16:48] <daftykins> abdel: don't paste please
[16:48] <lxiref> but i need to shutdown ubuntu
[16:48] <lxiref> there is no logic on what u said
[16:48] <Nexususus> lxiref: eh? No, no need to buy anything, there's probably nothing wrong with it.  It's just got a flag set,
[16:48] <Nexususus> run chkdsk in windoes
[16:48] <lxiref> and then live test?
[16:49] <ngomes> hello , my xubuntu 15.04 dont resume after suspend ... sometimes it shows "session is locked" message , but nothing happens , i need to turn off power and turn on again . any clue how to solve this ?
[16:49] <daftykins> lxiref: "shutdown ubuntu" - what are you talking about?
[16:49] <Nexususus> daftykins: all yours lol
[16:49] <lxiref> chkdsk will fix it?
[16:49] <daftykins> Nexususus: thanks... :P
[16:49] <lxiref> thats what i want to know..
[16:49] <Nexususus> lxiref: chkdsk will clear the "dirty" flag yes
[16:50] <daftykins> lxiref: first off... *DO* you have Windows 8?
[16:50] <TomyWork> lxiref shut down the live cd, boot into windows, make it shut down cleanly through whatever means, then you can probably mount the ntfs partition in linux without it complaining
[16:50] <Nexususus> assuming it's not got an actual error
[16:50] <lxiref> yes
[16:50] <lxiref> thanks TomyWOrk
[16:50] <TomyWork> but
[16:50] <lxiref> bye for now
[16:50] <TomyWork> stop
[16:50] <Nexususus> hah
[16:50] <TomyWork> do you know how to shut it down cleanly?
[16:50] <daftykins> you should've given a link for the proper procedure
[16:50] <akj> Can someone tell me what enables/disable the autosuspending of USB devices?
[16:50] <Nexususus> he's gone TomyWork
[16:50] <Nexususus> lol
[16:50] <TomyWork> well, his problem
[16:51] <daftykins> hrmm this'll be handy for if that user comes back - http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/windows-8-proper-shutdown-without-disabling-hybrid-boot/
=== JanC_ is now known as JanC
[16:51] <Nexususus> anyway, yeah, as I was saying, my ideal distro would be basically LMDE but with Ubuntu patches
[16:51] <ngomes> akj, i know there's a config file somewhere where you can define modules to suspend ...
[16:52] <daftykins> Nexususus: this is a support only channel, the general chat is in #ubuntu-offtopic :)
[16:52] <saymoo> reading up... windows 8 has no normal shutdown anymore?
[16:52] <Nexususus> daftykins: my bad, sorry
[16:52] <TomyWork> daftykins that link text lacks a TM :)
[16:52] <philip_> wat is the meaning of this System information disabled due to load higher than 4.0
[16:53] <daftykins> philip_: you logged into a server over SSH too soon, so the MOTD (message of the day) did not execute as the system was already working hard.
[16:53] <daftykins> the MOTD typically checks for updates and gives you system stats
[16:53] <binarywork> what is the audio device in ubuntu ?
[16:54] <Nexususus> binarywork: ?
[16:54] <binarywork> dev/audio?
[16:54] <Nexususus> your soundcard?
[16:54] <Nexususus> oh, right
[16:54] <TomyWork> my motd on this one server i dont update lists the update stuff like 10 times
[16:54] <abdel> I THINK I WILL JUST UPGRADE MY UBUNTU TO 14.10
[16:54] <daftykins> TomyWork: umm very confusing english there
[16:54] <daftykins> abdel: that's nice but no need for caps
[16:54] <TomyWork> i'll refactor :)
[16:55] <Nexususus>  /dev/snd I would have thought
[16:55] <saymoo> abdel, OK
[16:55] <headsetguy> Hello is it possible to create a bridge network while keeping my bonding setting intact and if so any pointers on how to achieve this?
[16:55] <abdel> because i cant seem to solve the issue
[16:55] <TomyWork> daftykins  I have this one server that i don't update. when i log into via ssh, it lists the update stuff like 10 times as part of the motd
[16:55] <compdoc> TomyWork, whew
[16:55] <daftykins> TomyWork: oh right, that's a weird bug. which version?
[16:56] <TomyWork> 12.04
[16:56] <daftykins> headsetguy: bear in mind ##networking exists
[16:56] <compdoc> I just upgraded a 12.04 server to 14.04. went pretty smoothly, mostly
[16:57] <TomyWork> i wont do that though :)
[16:57] <Nexususus> binarywork: you could just do 'aplay -l'
[16:57] <ki7mt> abdel, I would not advise another upgrade, if you want 14.10 or 15.04, install it form the ISO. Upgrading more than 2 levels will certainly cause you problems.
[16:57] <daftykins> abdel: what issue?
[16:57] <Nexususus> that;ll list the devices
[16:57] <binarywork> thanks
[16:57] <abdel> ki7mt...my current ISO is 14.04
[16:57] <Nexususus> binarywork: but it should be /dev/snd
[16:57] <abdel> so am upgrading to 14.10
[16:58] <TomyWork> ki7mt i updated 2 levels and i got problems :)
[16:58] <daftykins> install, not ISO
[16:58] <ki7mt> abdel, did you install 14.04 from an ISO or upgrade to 14.04 ?
[16:58] <philip_> so sorry i missed the explanation wat is the meaning of this System information disabled due to load higher than 4.0
[16:58] <daftykins> philip_: so scroll up
[16:58] <TomyWork> which is why i said earlier that i cant understand their decision not to offer direct-to-LTS updates from every release
[16:58] <abdel> i usually upgrade
[16:59] <TomyWork> "...but when i don't, i make sure i'm on a really old non-lts release" :D
[16:59] <daftykins> people - there is WAY too much general chatter going on. Take it to #ubuntu-offtopic and leave this channel for questions and answers.
[16:59] <daftykins> TomyWork: this means you.
[16:59] <TomyWork> sorry
[16:59] <Spec-Chum> work finished, home time!
[16:59] <Spec-Chum> Cya !
[17:00] <abdel> why i upgrade is because i dont want to lose my settings
[17:00] <Nexususus> oh lol, forgot I was logged on web chat twice
[17:00] <ki7mt> abdel, I would recommendation 14.04 LTS ISO install. There's little to be gained for the average user in 14.10 and 15.04, not to mention, they are limited support releases.
[17:00] <Nexususus> Spec-Chum out (again)
[17:00] <abdel> from ISO, i will start all over again
[17:00] <daftykins> abdel: and this is why it works reliably
[17:00] <EagleDelta> Does anyone here know anything about Canonical Paid Support for enterprise?
[17:01] <LMNOP__> this is why wut works?
[17:01] <Knight80> Hello everyone
[17:01] <LMNOP__> hi
[17:01] <EagleDelta> such as what is their security support like? Do they support Identity Manaagemnt (FreeIPA, 389)?
[17:01] <LMNOP__> how can i help u
[17:01] <ki7mt> abdel, The other Plus Side to installing 14.04 LTS, when 16.04 LTS is released, you can upgrade LTS to LTS ..
[17:01] <EagleDelta> or are they almost 100% focused on OpenStack and Ubnutu core?
[17:02] <daftykins> EagleDelta: ask them
[17:02] <abdel> so i should install 14.04 LTS ISO
[17:02] <abdel> but i will loose my settings
[17:02] <Knight80> Sound doesn't work on my system, Ubuntu Gnome 15.04
[17:02] <ki7mt> abdel, That is my recommendation, yes, 14.04 LTS
[17:03] <awktion> iz iz thez championz
[17:03] <LMNOP__> Knight80, what kind of sound card is it
[17:03] <Knight80> LMNOP__ I mean it works sometimes, and some other times it doesn't
[17:04] <headsetguy> daftykins: true but wouldn't i be able to get help me
[17:04] <LMNOP__> oh crap hmm
[17:04] <lsftex> Hi
[17:04] <Knight80> LMNOP__ It's the one on the motherboard
[17:04] <LMNOP__> hi how can i help u
[17:04] <daftykins> headsetguy: sorry i don't understand your sentence
[17:04] <lsftex> I'm the one with windows8, livetest- ubuntu. I ran chkdsk and nothing changed..
[17:04] <LMNOP__> Knight80, ok so i would first check the mute button
[17:04] <lsftex> I still can't launch the devices
[17:04] <LMNOP__> do that and let me know wut happens
[17:04] <Knight80> LMNOP__ Checked
[17:05] <LMNOP__> was it on or off
[17:05] <Knight80> It was on
[17:05] <awktion> abdel: you can save your data, tar your home directory preserving permissions and back it up
[17:05] <Dro__> is it possible to add skype to Thunderbird notification bar ?
[17:05] <daftykins> lsftex: yeah you were given bad advice. press windows key + R then type "shutdown /s /t 0" in windows 8 to shutdown, then boot the live session again.
[17:05] <LMNOP__> so it was muted or no
[17:05] <adamkhan> hi i searched a lot online but cant find what i am looknig for related to boot-repair and grub.....maybe i dont know what to search for........ can anyone help or direct me to a relevant irc please...urgent...exam season
[17:05] <awktion> moving forward put /home on its own partition
[17:05] <Knight80> LMNOP__ It wasn't muted, I mean
[17:05] <awktion> so if you have to reinstall you can just overwrite /root
[17:05] <lsftex> omg this is troll people
[17:05] <lsftex> i really don't know
[17:05] <LMNOP__> ok so we tried that hm
[17:06] <jost> Hi! I'm trying to use ufw, and want to allow anyone on the 192.168.178.0/24 subnet to communicate with my machine using tcp on port 80. I've tried this, and much more: `sudo ufw allow in proto tcp from 192.168.178.0/24 port any to any port 80`
[17:06] <daftykins> lsftex: who are you calling a troll? can you focus on the problem please...
[17:06] <adamkhan> http://paste2.org/UY4IYA6k this is what boot-repair gave me
[17:06] <LMNOP__> the volume or maybe there is no power is there power going to the speakers?
[17:06] <lsftex> daftykins: is the problem on windows 8 only?
[17:06] <jost> looks ok when looking in the manpages, but does not work. Error message is "ERROR: Could not find protocol"
[17:06] <LMNOP__> forgot to ask that
[17:06] <Knight80> LMNOP__ I run alsamixer and everything is turned up
[17:06] <LMNOP__> ok
[17:07] <daftykins> lsftex: windows 8 uses a hybrid shutdown technique which locks the drive - stopping Ubuntu from mounting the disk in a live session. why do you want to access it from Ubuntu anyway?
[17:07] <headsetguy> Hello is it possible to create a bridge network while keeping my bonding setting intact and if so any pointers on how to achieve this?
[17:07] <lsftex> daftykins: to backup my sdhc..
[17:07] <lsftex> What about sd reader?
[17:07] <LMNOP__> volume is up so then maybe check if there is power or no
[17:07] <daftykins> headsetguy: have you even tried asking in the other channel?
[17:07] <TomyWork> you dont need to mount the ntfs partition on your hard drive to read from your sdhc chip
[17:07] <TomyWork> lsftex ^
[17:07] <daftykins> lsftex: what's wrong with copy and paste with Windows?
[17:08] <lsftex> oh no
[17:08] <pwpul> Hi, I'm having the following problem. When I try to install a program with the software center I get this error: Software can't be installed or removed because the authentication service is not available. (org.freedesktop.PolicyKit.Error.Failed: ('system-bus-name', {'name':  ':1.150'}): org.debian.apt.install-or-remove-packages. Can anyone help me out?
[17:08] <Knight80> LMNOP__ Shall I reboot the system? I mean, I've recently updated the system...
[17:08] <LMNOP__> IS THERE POWER OR NO
[17:08] <lsftex> the sd card in windows is only read the first partition. I need to backup whole
[17:08] <LMNOP__> ok sorry
[17:08] <Knight80> LMNOP__ Yes, there is power
[17:08] <LMNOP__> hmm maybe try that yes
[17:08] <ayan_> after upgrading to 15.04, desktop sessions aren't working.  after entering my password into lightdm, my desktop is briefly visible before it appears to log me right back out after playing the error 'drum' noise.
[17:08] <lsftex> TomyWork: no such lsftex
[17:08] <daftykins> lsftex: right so run what i said to shutdown windows properly then boot the live session again, ok?
[17:09] <ayan_> googling around appeared to point to nvidia driver issues but i'm not using nvidia. :(
[17:09] <lsftex> no thanks
[17:09] <daftykins> ayan_: test the guest session first up to confirm it's fine
[17:09] <lsftex> Any other help?
[17:09] <saymoo> why no?
[17:09] <awktion> ayan_: check Xorg logs
[17:09] <ayan_> daftykins: the guest session doesn't work either.
[17:09] <daftykins> lsftex: i just gave you the answer! go and do it!
[17:09] <lsftex> dafykins: no thanks
[17:09] <TomyWork> lsftex what do you think "shutdown" means?
[17:09] <saymoo> daftykins is right
[17:10] <daftykins> lsftex: what, why not? i just told you the ONLY solution
[17:10] <lsftex> TomyWork: You know what it means.
[17:10] <awktion> might be something in your home dir starting with .x or .X
[17:10] <daftykins> lsftex: are you a troll?
[17:10] <lsftex> There is no only solution
[17:10] <TomyWork> lsftex in your words, what does it mean?
[17:10] <daftykins> yes there is only one and i have supplied it, you are being a stubborn fool.
[17:10] <lsftex> it's not work
[17:10] <awktion> otherwise /var/log/Xorg.*.log
[17:10] <SchrodingersScat> there are no unwinable wars or unsingabe songs, yeah
[17:10] <TomyWork> (i think you have a misconception about the meaning of "shutdown")
[17:10] <lsftex> wow wow.. You don't need to force help.
[17:10] <daftykins> lsftex: you used the GUI shutdown button and not the method i described.
[17:10] <ki7mt> pwpul, Lonshot, but make sure your PolicyKit Authentication Agent is checked in Startup Programs
[17:10] <awktion> lsftex: whats your issue?
[17:10] <ki7mt> Longshot,
[17:11] <daftykins> lsftex: read : http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/windows-8-proper-shutdown-without-disabling-hybrid-boot/
[17:11] <lsftex> See it as you helped me, any other canhelp?
[17:11] <pwpul> ki7mt it is...
[17:11] <ayan_> awktion: the X server logs don't show anything interesting.  .xsession-errors has a few lines about upstart-event-bridge main process respawning too fast.
[17:11] <daftykins> lsftex: fair enough, but you're being utterly silly ignoring fact.
[17:11] <awktion> ayan_: dpkg -l|grep 'nvidia\|fglr'
[17:11] <ki7mt> pwpul, then check to see if  policykit-1-gnome is installed: dpkg -l  policykit-1-gnome
[17:11] <lsftex> awktion: ntfs partition is in an unsafe state. I just want to read sd card but windows late.
[17:12] <lsftex> daftykins: wow wow. I didn't ask for your help. Watch your eyes.
[17:12] <awktion> windows late?
[17:12] <ayan_> awktion: returns nothing.
[17:12] <daftykins> *facepalm*
[17:12]  * saymoo is confused...
[17:12] <TomyWork> lsftex i have two questions:
[17:12] <lsftex> awktion: forget about windows. I just want to mount sdhc
[17:12] <saymoo> daftykins helped you :)
[17:12] <ayan_> brb
[17:12] <TomyWork> 1. is the sdhc card ntfs?
[17:12] <lsftex> maybe
[17:13] <TomyWork> can you make that a no or a yes?
[17:13] <daftykins> ayan_: can you check your users /home directory for any files that might be owned by root instead of you?
[17:13] <daftykins> oh, user left :/

[17:13] <awktion> !pastbin
[17:13] <daftykins> adamkhan: what's the story behind this?
[17:13] <lsftex> awktion: I'm on live test ubuntu
[17:14] <ki7mt> pwpul, Ok, well it's installed. What version of Ubuntu you using?
[17:14] <awktion> lsftex: oic
[17:14] <lsftex> Excuse me?

[17:14] <daftykins> adamkhan: you are not running ubuntu, you are using "UberStudent 4.1 Epicurus" so we cannot help you here.
[17:15] <saymoo> lsftex, perhaps you should explain again, to all, what you want to accomplish exactly, what the current situation is... and what you've tried so far :)
[17:15] <awktion> lsftex: you may need to mount it from inside windows
[17:15] <awktion> get a windows livecd and try to mount and umount a cpl times
[17:15] <pwpul> thanks ubottu!
[17:15] <adamkhan> uberstudent is based on ubuntu and they dont have an active irc channel :( urgently need help.... I installed uberstudent onto a partition, but then when i restarted, there was no grub... so i ran a live cd and ran boot-repair as per suggestions on ubuntu forums....but then although i got grub, i couldnt laod any OS
[17:15] <daftykins> awktion: there is nothing wrong with the volume, Windows 8 does a hybrid shutdown which locks the volume from Linux
[17:16] <lsftex> saymoo: I'm on live test ubuntu. And I'm trying to mount sdhc and give me some ntfs problem.
[17:16] <daftykins> adamkhan: yes but does not permit it to be supported here, sorry.
[17:16] <ayan_> hmm.  okay -- so purging lightdm and re-installing it fixed my login problem.
[17:16] <daftykins> adamkhan: perhaps you should just fix Windows and not mess around installing different OSs during exam time?
[17:16] <TomyWork> lsftex how are you trying to mount it anyway?
[17:16] <ayan_> thanks for your help.
[17:17] <daftykins> ayan_: ah neat
[17:17] <adamkhan> i realised that!! so dumb of me....could anyone help in private message? i messed up big time and need to fix this thing asap,
[17:17] <pwpul> ki7mt Ubuntu 14.04
[17:17] <ki7mt> pwpul, You could also try updating the pol;-kit: sudo /usr/lib/policykit-1-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1  then try you upgrade / isntall again.
[17:17] <adamkhan> thats exactly what i want to do, fix it so i can boot into windows and il look into the rest of the stuff after im done with exams
[17:18] <daftykins> adamkhan: no, ignore GRUB, fix Windows by asking in ##windows .
[17:18] <adamkhan> just need to boot into windows.....
[17:18] <lsftex> using mount command?
[17:18] <adamkhan> oh, ok thanks
[17:18] <pwpul> ki7mt, I don't understand it exactly. Updating or running it under sudo?
[17:18] <awktion> lsftex: http://askubuntu.com/questions/145902/unable-to-mount-windows-ntfs-filesystem-due-to-hibernation
[17:19] <ki7mt> pwpul, running it will update the agent, then ensure it's enabled at startup, then re-boot, and try your install / upgrade a gain.
[17:19] <awktion> Workaround for all versions of Windows:
[17:19] <pwpul> ki7mt, ok I'll try
[17:20] <awktion> kk gl hf
[17:20] <ki7mt> pwpul, And yes, you need to use sudo to run the command.
[17:20] <TomyWork> workaround for all versions of windows: uninstall windows? :D
[17:20] <awktion> that's a solution not a workaround!
[17:20] <daftykins> awktion: that's a bad idea.
[17:20] <daftykins> also it's Windows 8 so it's hybrid boot, not hibernation
[17:20] <daftykins> (though they are similar)
[17:21] <awktion> daftykins: #2 seems fine it's read only so relatively safe
[17:21] <pwpul> ki7mt, here the output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11029015/
[17:22] <awktion> ntfs-3g isn't really new, though I remember when it was
[17:22] <lsftex> thanks man
[17:22] <daftykins> awktion: but that's not what the user is after, the user wants to backup an SD card to the system...
[17:22] <daftykins> mounting read only for the target intended to be backed up to is useless :)
[17:23] <EriC^> ssarah: np :)
[17:23] <lsftex> someone said he diable hibernate and doesn't work for him
[17:23] <awktion> daftykins: my first advice was to mount partition from windows...
[17:23] <ki7mt> pwpul, It would appear there is / was a bug in 14.04: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/policykit-1/+bug/1411895
[17:23] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1411895 in policykit-1 (Ubuntu) "Unable to start polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1" [Undecided,New]
[17:23] <daftykins> awktion: it *is* the Windows drive XD
[17:23] <daftykins> awktion: you are unfamiliar with Windows 8 i take it?
[17:24] <lsftex> forget it i give up
[17:24] <awktion> if somethingt's to be backed up to the windows drive then windows on would allow it, if it's something to be backed up from the windows drive windows off and read only should be fine
[17:24] <daftykins> lsftex: i gave you the correct answer, i'm 100% serious :)
[17:24] <daftykins> lsftex: if you'd followed what i said you could be back in ubuntu backing up that card, 30 mins ago
[17:25] <daftykins> but nevermind :)
[17:25] <awktion> i admin many win8 boxen, but those guys don't dual boot or run linux on those systems at all
[17:25] <pwpul> and this means, ki7mt, ...can't be solved?
[17:25] <awktion> lsftex: you should probably listen to him bro
[17:25] <Voyage> I started openvpn by service openvpn start on ubuntu but its not starting up. No errors shown. How can i debug?
[17:25]  * awktion shrugs
[17:25] <lsftex> just want to read stuff about ot
[17:25] <lsftex> it*
[17:26] <lsftex> bye
[17:26] <saymoo> bye
[17:26] <ki7mt> pwpul, Not exactly, are you getting this error when using the Software Center?
[17:26] <daftykins> awktion: ah, have you done the alternative shutdown method where you bypass hybrid shutdown then? it's the holding shift whilst clicking on shutdown or restart, that brings up the EFI menu
[17:26] <pwpul> ki7mt, indeed!
[17:27] <ki7mt> pwpul, Ok, All I can suggest for that one is reinstalling it: sudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install software-center software-properties-common software-properties-gtk
[17:27] <awktion> heh never had to
[17:27] <awktion> when win8 breaks i image
=== ken is now known as Guest17323
[17:28] <pwpul> ki7mt, I'll try it!
[17:28] <daftykins> awktion: nah nor me really, but it's the only way to allow NTFS volumes to be mounted under Linux without these warnings of hibernation state without entirely disabling the fast bootup of 8
[17:28] <awktion> daftykins: ye, not a bad price to pay
[17:28] <ki7mt> pwpul, Make sure you do a restart afterwards, to force reloading the poli-kit agent.
[17:28] <pwpul> ki7mt ok!
[17:35] <pwpul> ki7mt, I did it, but the same error remains
[17:36] <ki7mt> pwpul, and you rebooted after the installation ?
[17:36] <jayjo> Is there a way to set up 'internal' dns of some sort? Eg doesn't localhost direct to 127.0.0.1? Can I set a name like localhost (maybe intranet or something) to direct to a URI
[17:36] <pwpul> ki7mt yes!
[17:36] <daftykins> jayjo: you can edit /etc/hosts and point a domain to localhost so it runs locally
[17:36] <saymoo> jayjo, /etc/hosts
[17:37] <saymoo> what daftykins said ;)
[17:37] <daftykins> saymoo: ^5
[17:37] <jayjo> will that only be for my local machine or for my local network?
[17:37] <daftykins> jayjo: local machine, unless you edit the other hosts and set their IP to your internal one
[17:37] <ki7mt> pwpul, Ok, at this point, I would post comments on the bug listed above 1411895 as this is clearly affecting you.
[17:37] <lsfret> Thanks for help solving ubuntu ntfs problem
[17:38] <lsfret> I can't find the sd card/reader/ to mount it
[17:38] <ki7mt> pwpul, Bu I do not know of an additional solution for this.
[17:38] <daftykins> lsfret: sudo apt-get install pastebinit && sudo parted -l | pastebinit
[17:38] <pwpul> ki7mt not accustomed to bug commenting. What should I mention?
[17:38] <lsfret> pastebin?
[17:38] <lsfret> daftykins?
[17:38] <daftykins> yes?
[17:39] <jayjo> OK thanks that'll solve my issue for now - is there a way to set that up for my local network so my coworkers can access it too if they're on the internal network?
[17:39] <lsfret> why

[17:39] <ki7mt> pwpul, The exact errors you seeing .. here's an over view on bug reporting: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs
[17:39] <lsfret> I don't post any lines..
[17:39] <daftykins> lsfret: the above command installs a pastebin program and runs a command, piping it to pastebin so you can share it with me - so i can see what disks are detected in your system
[17:39] <lsfret> What to do after it?
[17:40] <daftykins> lsfret: it will give you a pastebin URL to share here
[17:40] <ki7mt> pwpul, More info using ubuntu-bug: http://askubuntu.com/questions/5121/how-do-i-report-a-bug
=== tcpman is now known as Guest25578
[17:40] <pwpul> thanks ki7mt. Apart from the bug report, how can I install applications now? Or do I have to do a complete reinstall of Ubuntu?
[17:41] <ki7mt> pwpul, From the command line, using apt-get
[17:41] <lsfret> Do I need wine to read sd card?
[17:42] <lsfret> or driver?
[17:42] <jchmrt> Hey everyone, a friend of mine is periodically getting crashes in which he gets errors like this when trying to run commands: "bash: /usr/bin/sudo:3 Input/output error" or "bash: /bin/ls: No such file or directory". We think that it is a issue with the drive, but it is brand new. Is there any reason apart from drive failure which could cause these type of problems?
[17:42] <daftykins> lsfret: no
[17:42] <daftykins> lsfret: can you run the above command, then?
[17:42] <pwpul> ok, I'll have a look how that works. Thanks for your help, ki7mt!
[17:42] <ki7mt> pwpul, It appears the issue is with the Software Center, but not when using apt-get .. you may want to update and upgrade there first also.
[17:42] <lsfret> If I'm on live test what i download is saved .. like library?
[17:42] <daftykins> lsfret: no, you have to copy things to your Windows drive
[17:42] <lsfret> Good
[17:43] <lsfret> So it's like deep freeze the live test?
[17:43] <daftykins> it runs in RAM so on reboot everything is gone
[17:43] <lsfret> oh
[17:43] <daftykins> so when i said "sudo apt-get install pastebinit" that program is only installed in RAM temporarily
[17:43] <pwpul> ki7mt: What do you mean update and upgrade there first. You mean update and upgrade my Ubuntu installation frop apt-get?
[17:44] <daftykins> lsfret: so, if you run "sudo parted -l" and share it via http://paste.ubuntu.com we can see if your SD card is being detected or not
[17:44] <ki7mt> pwpul, Open a terminal: ctrl+alt+t .. then ; sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade
[17:44] <lsfret> daftykins: im checking this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/492476/internal-sd-card-reader-not-mounted-detected-hp-realtek-rts5227
[17:44] <Baylink> QUERY: It appears an upgrade on our old laptop running Trusty knocked the b43 driver out of sync with the BCM4311 firmware, and I'm having trouble figuring out how to get the firmware updated.  Any pointers from Broadcom-y people?
[17:44] <awktion> daftykins: lspci -vvv might also be useful
[17:44] <awktion> oh right, ubuntu, with sudo of course
[17:44] <ki7mt> pwpul, After you upgrade, try the SW center again.
[17:45] <daftykins> lsfret: best to start simple and just run my suggestion rather than jump straight into assumptions that it's not even supported
[17:45] <awktion> lsfret: have no fear, walk through the path daftykins points out
[17:45] <pwpul> ki7mt, rebooting first?
[17:45] <awktion> walk gently brother
[17:45] <lsfret> daftykins: i have something 0a:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. Device 5249 (rev 01)
[17:45] <ki7mt> pwpul, I would, yes, just to be sure.
[17:46] <lsfret> i think it is the sd card
[17:46] <ki7mt> pwpul, Sorry, reboot after the upgrade
[17:46] <pwpul> Ok, ki7mt, there we go again (happy to have SSD!)
[17:46] <lsfret> no its wifi i think
[17:46] <lsfret> the realtek is sd card
[17:46] <ki7mt> pwpul, Well normally, reboots are not needed
[17:48] <lsfret> i found this: Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 7861MB
[17:48] <lsfret> Do I need to mount it?
[17:48] <awktion> lsfret: run
[17:48] <lsfret> I mean I want
[17:48] <lsfret> what run?
[17:48] <daftykins> lsfret: yes if you shared "sudo parted -l" we could have seen this from the first moment
[17:48] <awktion> 'mount ' without quotes
[17:48] <daftykins> lsfret: is there a reason you don't want to run commands i suggest?
[17:48] <lsfret> my data
[17:49] <daftykins> what?
[17:49] <daftykins> there is nothing private about sharing someones partition table
[17:49] <daftykins> here let me do it right now
[17:49] <awktion> http://linux.die.net/man/8/parted
[17:49] <lsfret> u dont have to
[17:49] <awktion> -l, --list
[17:49] <awktion> lists partition layout on all block devices
[17:49] <awktion> see lsfret ? it's safe
[17:49] <daftykins> http://paste.ubuntu.com/11029418/
[17:49] <awktion> like fdisk -l
[17:49] <lsfret> omg dont
[17:49] <daftykins> see, doesn't matter. it's not private info.
[17:49] <ki7mt> just run lsblk
[17:49] <lsfret> now its in internet u cant remove it
[17:50] <daftykins> big whoop.
[17:50] <saymoo> lsfret, we are not here to make thing worse for you, the commands giving are safe to use, unless told so
[17:50] <ObrienDave> OMG get over it
[17:50] <lsfret> i gtg
[17:50] <awktion> lsfret: nothing in that paste that's personally identifiable
[17:50] <lsfret> i mean thank u much
[17:50] <daftykins> lsfret: you are making this task one million times harder than it needs to be through stubbornness
[17:50] <ki7mt> or beter yet: sudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL
[17:50] <lsfret> i know :(
[17:51] <awktion> http://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk
[17:51] <awktion> lsblk is also great advice, see?
[17:51] <awktion> lsfret: you came to get help, and you have great help right there
[17:51] <Voyage> how can I enable tun
[17:51] <awktion> help us help you
[17:51] <awktion> or try #gentoo
[17:52] <pwpul> Hi, ki7mt, unfortunately the problem remains...
[17:52] <EriC^^> reminds me of the guy who blanked out his UUID once
[17:52] <EriC^^> that was pretty funny :D
[17:52] <pwpul> But I still have Ubuntu 14.04LTS. Shouldn't upgrade have brought me an other version?
[17:53] <Voyage> how can I enable tun
[17:53] <ki7mt> pwpul, Ok, I don't know what else to suggest here. CLearly there is still an issue with the SW center. At least you can install via apt get.
[17:53] <awktion> pwpul: what did you run to upgrade? that apt-get upgrade? that just updates the packages you have in
[17:53] <awktion> !upgrade
[17:53] <ubottu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
[17:54] <awktion> sudo update-manager -d
[17:54] <pwpul> awktion, I ran the commands ki7mt suggested: apt-get update and afterwards upgrade
[17:55] <awktion> yes that makes sure your 14.04 or whatever your current installed version is is up to date
[17:55] <awktion> it will not take you to the next version
[17:55] <daftykins> !info tunctl
[17:55] <ki7mt> awktion, His problem is with the policy-kit1 and the software center, not apt-get.
[17:55] <ubottu> Package tunctl does not exist in vivid
[17:55] <awktion> ki7mt: ?
[17:55] <ki7mt> Yeah, read back through history, there's allot to the issue.
[17:56] <daftykins> Voyage: install uml-utilities
[17:56] <daftykins> Voyage: then the program 'tunctl' will be available
[17:56] <awktion> ki7mt: is it installed to a disk?
[17:56] <awktion> and he wants to upgrade the distro?
[17:56] <awktion> sudo update-manager -d
[17:56]  * awktion shrugs
[17:56] <ki7mt> awktion, what are you talking about? He can isntall apps from the software center.
[17:56] <pwpul> indeed ki7mt! So you suggest to just go on using 14.04, and using apt-get to install programs?
[17:56] <ki7mt> "He can't"
[17:56] <daftykins> awktion: nah -d is for development release upgrade, i think - so not wise
[17:57] <ki7mt> pwpul, Untill the pol-kit bug is resolved, yes, use apt-get to install SW
[17:57] <awktion> ah ye might not need the flag at all
[17:58] <NateHiggers> hello i love ubuntu
[17:58] <pwpul> Great, ki7mt, thanks for your very kind help! Time for dinner and a toast to you...
[17:58] <TomyWork> Is there a way to know when this log entry from Xorg.1.log happened? [ 49074.983] (EE) Server terminated successfully (0). Closing log file.
[17:59] <awktion> try installing synaptic?
[17:59] <TomyWork> NateHiggers mind changing your nickname?
[17:59] <NateHiggers> TomyWork: my name is Nathan Higgers, are we not allowed to use our real names?
[17:59] <TomyWork> your name is not Nathan Higgers
[17:59] <NateHiggers> Yes, it is
[17:59] <TomyWork> prove it
[17:59] <NateHiggers> i can show you my id
[18:00] <NateHiggers> get on skype
[18:00] <TomyWork> i dont use skype
[18:00] <saymoo> TomyWork, what's wrong?
[18:00] <ki7mt> awktion, not a good idea to mix an match managers like that (synaptic, aptitude, apt-get), long discussion, but suffice it to say, it can end in tears.
[18:00] <daftykins> NateHiggers: do you have an ubuntu support question?
[18:00] <awktion> NateHiggers: you can use whatever name you like in general
[18:00] <awktion> most of us obfuscate our real names, but you are under no obligation to do so
[18:00] <TomyWork> saymoo swap that user's initials around
[18:01] <awktion> ki7mt: lets have that discussion
[18:01] <daftykins> lets get back on support topic peeps
[18:01] <daftykins> don't feed the troll :)
[18:01] <awktion> synaptic, aptitude, apt-get can be used interchangably
[18:01] <saymoo> TomyWork, but he hasn't
[18:01] <saymoo> so, i don't see the problem atm
[18:01] <NateHiggers> i would like to build guis in ubuntu
[18:01] <NateHiggers> is qt the only solution?
[18:01] <awktion> NateHiggers: also don't go showing ppl your id, it's the internets
[18:02] <NateHiggers> oh thanks, i thought we can trust people here
[18:02] <_war10ck_> NateHiggers: No, there is wx, Qt, TKInter
[18:02] <saymoo> NateHiggers, there are more gui toolkits available, e.g. gtk2
[18:02] <NateHiggers> what's the easiest to use?
[18:02] <awktion> i don't trust my cousins, much less internetfolks. trust is earned
[18:03] <TomyWork> winapi
[18:03] <NateHiggers> isn't winapi for windows?
[18:03] <ki7mt> awktion, aptitude and apt-get use the same repositories. But Aptitude does not itself use apt-get apt-cache etc . this will lead to issues over the long term.
[18:03] <awktion> ki7mt: not really issues, no
[18:04] <awktion> they all use the same system installing things, and checking dpkg you will see the correct packages installed
[18:04] <ki7mt> awktion, It's further compounded by the use of dpkg which does not resolve dependencies.
[18:04] <_war10ck_> NateHiggers: Which language are you using to program? Based on that the easiness comes
[18:04] <awktion> if you try to trust the history of any given schema your methodology is at fault
[18:04] <TomyWork> ki7mt  awktion one issue i'm aware of is that if you install things with apt-get and then run aptitude, aptitude might tell you that those packages you just installed are unneeded
[18:04] <awktion> dpkg is a tool in this scenario to check what's installed
[18:04] <TomyWork> and will want to remove them for you
[18:05] <alfatau> hello all. I need help to find an I/O bottleneck. I've a Sata 6Gbps SSD connected to a Sata 3Gbps controller. The declared (and observed) sequential bandwidth of the SSD is nearly 5Gbps but for me the throughput is nearly 2Gbps. It seems a controller bottleneck but I can't proof it or also I don't know how to achieve (if possible) the nearly 3Gbps expected performances. Can you help me?
[18:05] <awktion> apt-get can certainly look for what needs to be installed and isn't
[18:05] <Dro__> how to get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist ?
[18:05] <awktion> there are allowances for that in synaptic, and i'm certain aptitude has a few commands
[18:05] <awktion> so what, other than smoke, are you blowing here
[18:06] <TomyWork> awktion blowing smoke? me?
[18:06] <NateHiggers> i'm using ruby, javascript, and c
[18:06] <awktion> lol TomyWork
[18:06] <ki7mt> awktion, This not really a support issue, we should defer this to a later date / channel as it's fairly busy in here today.
[18:06] <TomyWork> oh him
[18:06] <awktion> ki7mt: if advice you give to ppl in this channel is based on this misguided assumption set, this is support related
[18:06] <TomyWork> aptitude and apt-get both use dpkg to actually install the packages. so the only possible issues would be with package selection
[18:07] <ki7mt> awktion, It's not misguided at all.
[18:07] <_war10ck_> NateHiggers: Check if Wx, Qt and TKInter have extensions for Ruby, I have used Python mostly and found WxPython to be easy
[18:07] <awktion> sounds pretty misguided to me
[18:07] <Voyage> daftykins thank
[18:07] <awktion> give me an example scenario where something bad happens
[18:08] <awktion> i'll spin up a vm and run through it now
[18:08] <NateHiggers> thanks _war10ck_
[18:09] <ki7mt> awktion, I'm done with this topic, if you want to research it further, by all means, have at it.
[18:09] <awktion> see? nothing but smoke ki7mt. I offer to put it to the test and you back down.
[18:09] <Voyage> daftykins cat: /dev/net/tun: File descriptor in bad state
[18:09] <_war10ck_> NateHiggers: Happy to help, there's a catch, sometimes the File menu bar doesn't appear in the GUI despite adding it in the code
[18:09] <awktion> I am willing to do so anytime, i'd be happy to learn something new, just ping me whenever i happen to be active if you change your mind.
[18:09] <daftykins> Voyage: why would you try and cat a tunnel?
[18:10] <Voyage> hm. written in docs of my vps
[18:10] <_war10ck_> NateHiggers: At that time write export UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 to take care of the same
[18:10] <Voyage> daftykins oh. nevermind. its an expected output. thanks again
[18:10] <daftykins> :) np
[18:11] <ki7mt> awktion, Im not here to "prove anything" to you, if you don't believe it, that's up to you.
[18:12] <awktion> i asked you to teach me not prove to me. there is every evidence to the opposite of what you advised, in official literature. so unless you can offer something to the contrary I have to say from over a decade of personal experience you're wrong
[18:13] <saymoo> ki7mt, awktion shake hands :)
[18:13] <ki7mt> awktion, 10 years, is that all you have,??  I've many more than 10, but I'm done with you.
[18:17]  * awktion offers hand
[18:22] <lsfret> hi

[18:22] <lsfret> no
[18:22] <saymoo> welcome back lsfret
[18:22] <lsfret> thanks much
[18:22] <TomyWork> hmm, how are you trying to mount it again?

[18:23] <SafeMoneyOnl> Up here And good Luck  -----> http://www.marketglory.com/strategygame/lolopoco
[18:23] <lsfret> I have this: Model: SD 00000 (sd/mmc) Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 7861MB Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
[18:24] <lsfret> Partition Table: msdos
[18:24] <TomyWork> lsfret that is the command you run to mount the sdhc?
[18:24] <lsfret> no
[18:24] <lsfret> parted -l and i pasted parts
[18:24] <TomyWork> i know, but i still want to know how you mount that sdhc
[18:25] <lsfret> Hmm..
[18:25] <lsfret> i try mount -t drive folder and didn't work
[18:25] <lsfret> im not familiar with these commands
[18:25] <TomyWork> mount -t drive folder just like that or are you missing "ntfs"?
[18:26] <Poindexter_> Is there an Ubuntu kernel or OS that is solely dedicated to professional studio recording? I have seen some but I am interested in someone who has actual experience with it.
[18:26] <lsfret> but it is msdos
[18:26] <TomyWork> the partition table is msdos
[18:27] <lsfret> my bad
[18:27] <lsfret> it says type: disk
[18:27] <pbx> Poindexter_, if you're looking for a special-purpose distribution i'd check distrowatch
[18:27] <Poindexter_> Thanks PBX.  :)
[18:27] <TomyWork> lsfret can you maybe paste the exact command you're using?
[18:27] <saymoo> Poindexter_, ubuntu studio
[18:27] <lsfret> hmm
[18:28] <TomyWork> because if the command gives you an error, chances are seeing the command might help us tell what is wrong, no?
[18:28] <lsfret> lsblk so i can see the name of volume( i think or driver)
[18:28] <saymoo> an ubuntu derivative specialized in audio and video use (with realtime kernel)
[18:28] <lsfret> oh
[18:28] <lsfret> hm
[18:28] <lsfret> are u sure ntfs and not fat32?
[18:29] <TomyWork> huh?
[18:29] <TomyWork> i dont know what kind of file system you have on your dhc
[18:29] <TomyWork> sdhc*
[18:29] <lsfret> about mount -t ... Hmm about lsblk i don't see mount point
[18:29] <TomyWork> or why you'd insist on not letting it autodetect
[18:29] <lsfret> maybe because it's not mounted i guess.
[18:30] <lsfret> autodetect is it even option?
[18:30] <TomyWork> type just "mount" to see what is mounted
[18:30] <daftykins> back again i see :)
[18:30] <TomyWork> yeah, autodetect is the default if you dont specify the type
[18:30] <saymoo> daftykins, lol
[18:30] <Poindexter_> SayMoo is that an apt-get or an install? Drivers are important too.
[18:30] <daftykins> lsfret: you need to paste the partition lines
[18:30] <TomyWork> i.e. no "-t ntfs" or "-t fat32" or anything
[18:31] <lsfret> TomyWork: /dev/sda7 on /media/ubuntu/PBR_DRV type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096) maybe this
[18:31] <saymoo> Poindexter_, it's a distro, however you could also install it over an ubuntu installation i believe (it used to be the case, a few years back)
[18:32] <lsfret> i don't know
[18:32] <lsfret> i don't know which is the sd card
[18:32] <saymoo> (as in, install it as packages... not whiping ubuntu)
[18:32] <saymoo> :)
[18:32] <TomyWork> lsfret hmm, does the PBR_DRV sound familiar to you?
[18:32] <lsfret> no
[18:32] <TomyWork> well you could take a look at it with ls or something
[18:32] <lsfret> there is nothing as recovery folder or distro
[18:32] <daftykins> sda would be your hard disk
[18:32] <saymoo> Poindexter_, http://ubuntustudio.org/
[18:33] <TomyWork> saymoo you mean "install via", not "install over" :)
[18:33] <lsfret> i can read 4 dev/sdaXY and there are all mounted
[18:33] <Poindexter_> Saymoo, I am trying to avoid using ProAudio tools and other stuff but there are other things that are for sale for Ubunto in which I don't like the advertisement nor the sales pitch and has 30 day warrantee and restrictions.
[18:33] <lsfret> gopar: how did you connect from comcast?
[18:33] <TomyWork> lsfret so inspect them all with ls to see what they are
[18:34] <TomyWork> i assume you know what's on your disks :)
[18:34] <lsfret> TomyWork: what do you mean, I'm sorry.
[18:34] <saymoo> Poindexter_, all that is included in ubuntu studio is free
[18:34] <TomyWork> lsfret run "ls /media/ubuntu/PBR_DRV"
[18:34] <saymoo> and they customized the kernel so it's realtime
[18:34] <saymoo> (for latency sake)
[18:35] <lsfret> i did that already, thanks. It didn't help. In way that is not my driver
[18:35] <Poindexter_> I have seen it before but was looking for open source studio stuff.
[18:35] <gopar> lsfret, magic?
[18:35] <TomyWork> lsfret that line you just said made no sense. try again?
[18:35] <lsfret> gopar, please
[18:35] <lsfret> is it proxy?
[18:35] <saymoo> Poindexter_, most is opensource
[18:35] <gopar> lsfret, never had any issues connecting. No proxy no nothing. I'm just connecting from home
[18:36] <lsfret> gopar: comcast is like something tv..
[18:36] <TomyWork> proxies... we used to have those here too, back in the 90s
[18:36] <lsfret> I just don't know
[18:37] <gopar> lsfret, what are you having issues with?
[18:37] <Poindexter_> I have spent thousands of dollars on software with windows and the stupid advertisements and background resident programs running and talking with the manufacturers over the internet is garbage.
[18:37] <lsfret> gopar: mount sd card/reader... In windows I just installed a driver
[18:37] <daftykins> lsfret: they are an ISP for cable internet
[18:38] <lsfret> That was come up to my mind but wasn't find the correct words..
[18:38] <daftykins> lsfret: you want to back up this card so you don't even need to mount it :)
[18:38] <Poindexter_> TSR
[18:38] <lsfret> What?
[18:38] <Poindexter_> Windows garbage
[18:38] <lsfret> I just want to backup the user folder so i can reinstall distro
[18:38] <lsfret> (raspbian)
[18:38] <daftykins> TSRs are from the DOS era :P
[18:38] <TomyWork> okay, now it's starting to make sense, lsfret
=== ken is now known as Guest95470
[18:39] <daftykins> TomyWork: a quick dd image backup makes sense to me
[18:39] <daftykins> i'm doing house chores now so i can't help
[18:39] <TomyWork> go mount it read-only and get it over with :)
[18:39] <daftykins> plus lsfret doesn't run anything i say :D
[18:39] <lsfret> i cant find the driver
[18:39] <daftykins> you don't need a driver
[18:39] <daftykins> and you don't need to mount it
[18:39] <daftykins> for the love of Tux will you please pay attention ;_;
[18:39] <lsfret> i mean the driver(the disc name)
[18:40] <daftykins> *drive
[18:40] <lsfret> yes
[18:40] <daftykins> it told you in parted
[18:40] <daftykins> so mount the Windows disc, then use 'dd' to image up the drive
[18:40] <Poindexter_> Terminate Stay Resident still exists. Just open up a command prompt and type in MSCONFIG and see what is running in the background.
[18:40] <lsfret> lol no idiea what did u say
[18:40] <daftykins> sorry Windows disk
[18:41] <TomyWork> me neither... i think he wants to image his sdhc card
[18:41] <TomyWork> not his windows disk
[18:41] <daftykins> lsfret: paste me the output of "sudo parted -l" in a private message then, because this is really beginning to frustrate me
[18:41] <daftykins> TomyWork: yes but it needs to be saved somewhere
[18:41] <TomyWork> the cloud? :)
[18:41] <daftykins> due to being in a live session
[18:41] <TomyWork> i assume it's not a ton of data he wants to save
[18:42] <lsfret> yes got error: Error: /dev/mmcblk0: unrecognised disk label   from your command(sudo parted -l)
[18:42] <daftykins> that doesn't matter
[18:42] <daftykins> so that's the SD card then
[18:43] <lsfret> i type mount and the drive
[18:43] <lsfret> it's loading.. :D
[18:43] <daftykins> lsfret: now you need to mount one of the NTFS Windows partitions from /dev/sda for where to store the backup
[18:43] <TomyWork> Poindexter_ by that definition pretty much every application is a TSR :)
[18:43] <daftykins> lsfret: argh you don't. need. to mount. it.
[18:43] <lsfret> i have windows8 folder already open..
[18:43] <lsfret> why??!??
=== mhall119 is now known as mhall119|afk
[18:43] <daftykins> because you can't backup multiple partitions that way
[18:44] <lsfret> you mean i need to do something like cp folder to folder?
[18:44] <daftykins> no you don't do that
[18:44] <daftykins> you use an image writing program to dump the entire card to an image file
[18:44] <lsfret> Sorry I don't understand you.
[18:44] <daftykins> well what are you hoping to do with the mounted disk? you can't just copy files
[18:45] <lsfret> That is not a folder?
[18:45] <TomyWork> Poindexter_ in a modern OS (i.e. not DOS), many processes can run at the same time. what you describe is actually the general case, not a special case (TSR)
[18:45] <mahdi_ja> hi all
[18:45] <daftykins> lsfret: you can't just file copy an OS as backup
[18:45] <Poindexter_> TomyWork this is why we need to  use that command to see what is running in the background. In fact there is a free software called: "What's running" free and virus free and it shows everything running in Windows. Good tip. I am not sure if it is safe these days but it has always been a good free software.
[18:45] <lsfret> Error: /dev/mmcblk0: unrecognised disk label  (not work)
[18:45] <daftykins> lsfret: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=46911
[18:45] <TomyWork> Poindexter_ the special case is waiting for the spawned program to exit before showing a prompt again
[18:45] <TomyWork> "free and virus free" what
[18:45] <TomyWork> just use the task manager
[18:46] <lsfret> thanks that was good link
[18:46] <TomyWork> or sysinternals process explorer if you want to be thorough
[18:46] <daftykins> lsfret: but note you have to change it to be appropriate for your situation
[18:46] <TomyWork> on linux you would use top (or better yet: htop) instead
[18:46] <lsfret> i just don't understand why you say i can''t copy it.. Is it different types?
[18:46] <Poindexter_> Task manager doesn't always show what is running. MSCONFIG shows more.
[18:46] <lsfret> how do i need to look on it?
[18:46] <mahdi_ja> i have a laptop asus v3-572g with hybrid graphic card i install bumblebee but when i use it i get this error
[18:46] <mahdi_ja> [ 7058.501671] [ERROR]Cannot access secondary GPU - error: Could not load GPU driver
[18:46] <lsfret> like u cant open exe on linux?
[18:47] <Poindexter_> I use TOP all of the time with Linux.
[18:47] <daftykins> lsfret: i'm saying you can't backup an OS by copying files
[18:47] <TomyWork> Poindexter_ what else does it show?
[18:47] <lsfret> ok
[18:47] <TomyWork> sorry, dont have a windows here right now
[18:47] <EriC^^> lsfret: what are you trying to do?
[18:47] <bekks> EriC^^: He is about to dd an entired disk, as a backup.
[18:48] <EriC^^> bekks: oh ok
[18:48] <TomyWork> EriC^^ he wants to back up (the user directory of) an sdhc chip while he's in a live cd thing
[18:48] <lsfret> Eric^^: the sdhc has my distro(long story short fsdk problem... people told me to install raspbian again), so i backup, format, and install raspbian.
[18:48] <daftykins> EriC^^: or at least i'm trying to get there but it's been... slow going :P
[18:48] <Poindexter_> MSCONFIG also can uncheck any program on bootstrap to load up.
[18:48] <TomyWork> Poindexter_ you're talking about autostart
[18:48] <lsfret> a
[18:48] <TomyWork> that's not necessairly what's currently running
[18:49] <lsfret> this: /dev/sdb1   *          63    31506431    15753184+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT
[18:49] <Poindexter_> That is another story.
[18:49] <daftykins> lsfret: which device is /dev/sdb ?
[18:49] <lsfret> oh
[18:49] <daftykins> lsfret: really if you would just share the entire parted output it would make life so much more easy =|
[18:49] <lsfret> i think it's the ubuntu
[18:49] <lsfret> because the size
[18:50] <TomyWork> Poindexter_ no, that is pretty much all of the story
[18:50] <lsfret> so i just need to c+p what he did but change it?
[18:50] <FantomX_12> slt
[18:50] <TomyWork> it shows services and autostart configuration
[18:50] <Poindexter_> TomyWork you are funny.    :)
[18:50] <daftykins> yes by making it appropriate for your drive mounts
[18:51] <lsfret> Anyone is with laptop?
[18:51] <TomyWork> Poindexter_  for every service there is a process and the task manager shows that process
[18:51] <FantomX_12> y a des francofones ici ?

[18:51] <TomyWork> Poindexter_  at least if you told it to show all users' processes
[18:52] <mahdi_ja> any one can help me
[18:52] <MonkeyDust> Fuchs  mieux, not meilleur ;)
[18:52] <daftykins> mahdi_ja: not until you ask a question
[18:52] <daftykins> oh you did
[18:52] <TomyWork> mahdi_ja with the amount of information you have given so far, nope
[18:52]  * daftykins reads
[18:53] <TomyWork> oops :D
[18:53] <lsfret> this channel change or the people as i was here before.
[18:53] <daftykins> mahdi_ja: bumblebee is the old way, the modern way is nvidia-prime - purge all bumblebee packages then install an nvidia driver with nvidia-prime
[18:53] <Poindexter_> TomyWork you can use these commands:   top  ; atop  ;  htop
[18:53] <TomyWork> daftykins does that actually work now?
[18:53] <daftykins> TomyWork: has since release
[18:54] <TomyWork> i mean the dual graphics card stuff in general
[18:54] <TomyWork> i tried it back then with 12.04 i think and it... wasn't pleasant
[18:54] <TomyWork> i tried bumblebee and something called primus
[18:54] <mahdi_ja> daftykins, same this link : http://xmodulo.com/install-configure-nvidia-optimus-driver-ubuntu.html
[18:55] <daftykins> mahdi_ja: i don't understand what you're saying?
[18:55] <jpereira> I have used the 14.04 trusty. And i would like to know about the best way to upgrade the libmtp. someone could give me suggestions? e.g: I won't to get/configure/make/make install, i prefer to upgrade the package.
[18:55] <ki7mt> lsfret, the channel has not changed much, same people as before for the most part.
[18:55] <TomyWork> just want to know if i can buy one of those dual graphics card laptops next time :)
[18:55] <daftykins> TomyWork: depends if you like your hair i think
[18:55] <TomyWork> :D
[18:55] <lsfret> i was here.. Banned and then unbanned and someone told me to not come here again. Maybe daftykins lmao
[18:55] <mahdi_ja> daftykins, i search for installing nivida hybrid graphic card and find this tutorial :http://xmodulo.com/install-configure-nvidia-optimus-driver-ubuntu.html
[18:56] <TomyWork> lsfret you must have mistyped
[18:56] <ki7mt> lsfret, I don't thing anyone trying t help you would say that. In any case, they need info from you and you need to follow their advice.
[18:56] <mahdi_ja> daftykins, my lspci output is : http://pastebin.com/RQDDsPwr
[18:56] <lsfret> thing?
[18:57] <TomyWork> hink*
[18:57] <TomyWork> think*
[18:57] <ki7mt> lsfret, *Think .. sri.
[18:57] <daftykins> mahdi_ja: can you install pastebinit then run "dpkg -l | grep nvidia | pastebinit" ?
[18:57] <lsfret> Your english.. Although I'm not good at english
[18:57] <jpereira> anyone have suggestions?
[18:58] <daftykins> jpereira: apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade = will give the newest version
[18:58] <smtp_not_working> Hi everyone, I'm having a problem with setting up a mail server with ubuntu and zimbra
[18:58] <EriC^^> lsfret: cooperate with people so they can help you
[18:58] <TomyWork> lsfret he's connecting through a lithuanian server, how would you figure he's english? Many of us here arent native english speakers. it's just a matter of practice :)
[18:58] <daftykins> smtp_not_working: #ubuntu-server would make more sense for you then
[18:59] <smtp_not_working> daftykins: thank you
[18:59] <TomyWork> also what EriC^^ said
[18:59] <jpereira> daftykins,  the latest is 1.1.6, i would like to go to 1.1.8
[18:59] <jpereira> latest = stable
[18:59] <daftykins> !info libmtp trusty
[18:59] <lsfret> I don't think it's practice, there are some good at English.
[18:59] <ubottu> Package libmtp does not exist in trusty
[18:59] <jpereira> !info libmtp trusty
[18:59] <daftykins> jpereira: then either look for a PPA or install a newer ubuntu
[19:00] <mahdi_ja> daftykins, http://paste.ubuntu.com/11030383/
[19:00] <lsfret> But I don't understand what I typed.
[19:00] <TomyWork> lsfret it correlates with practice though :)
[19:00] <lsfret> sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb | gzip > /home/your_username/image`date +%d%m%y`.gz
[19:00] <lsfret> The '>' means output I believe
[19:00] <jpereira> daftykins,  I would like to use the version 1.1.8 from 'wily' https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libmtp
[19:00] <TomyWork> ok i'll explain
[19:00] <lsfret> Anyone can explain in few sentence in their gold time?
[19:00] <daftykins> mahdi_ja: your driver is way too old to work with your system, run "sudo apt-get purge bumblebee* " then go back into additional drivers and remove 304, put on 340+ instead
[19:01] <lsfret> Thanks ^^
[19:01] <daftykins> jpereira: you can't mix versions.
[19:01] <TomyWork> lsfret sudo means "run with super-user permissions the following command"
[19:01] <lsfret> I know sudo :D
[19:02] <lsfret> thi ubuntu is cool!!
[19:02] <ki7mt> lsfret, the > is a simple re-direction of gzip
[19:02] <daftykins> jpereira: what makes you think you need it?
[19:02] <lsfret> anyone with kubuntu?
=== niraj is now known as nirajranjan93
[19:02] <TomyWork> lsfret "dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb" means copy from /dev/sdb to no place in particular, with a block size of 4MB (i.e. copy in 4 MB chunks)
[19:02] <TomyWork> no place in particular = the standard output of the process
[19:02] <TomyWork> normally, that would end up in your terminal
[19:02] <mahdi_ja> daftykins, i run it but in additional driver i see "no additional driver available"
[19:02] <lsfret> thanks!
[19:03] <EriC^^> lsfret: what do you mean by fsdk problem?
[19:03] <jpereira> daftykins,  because i have a Moto-G, and found many issues in the mtp wikie and otherwise saying that was fixed in >= 1.1.8
[19:03] <daftykins> mahdi_ja: ok run "sudo apt-get purge nvidia* " as well, then reboot to make sure all the bumblebee and nvidia packages are gone
[19:03] <TomyWork> lsfret  but there is "| gzip" attached to it, which captures everything dd read from the sdhc and compresses it
[19:03] <daftykins> jpereira: what about guides that suggest udev related edits?
[19:03] <Poindexter_> Latest distro does not mean stable. It is BETA software. Stable is software that is accepted as the norm and BETA is a worked on version. Don't confuse it.
[19:03] <TomyWork> lsfret and then it puts the compressed result on *its* standard output
[19:04] <lsfret> Eric^^: Welcome. fsdk.. As I understood... When I plugged raspberrypi to router it give 500(power not sure if it's mA) and it suppose to get more. Because the router usb spec port gives 500 mA(Again im not sure)..
[19:04] <TomyWork> and then there's "> /home/your_username/image`date +%d%m%y`.gz", which tells your shell to redicrect that standard output to a file
[19:04] <jpereira> daftykins,  over udev changes works fine, but the rhythmbox didn't works... because he uses the libmtp. got it?
[19:05] <daftykins> jpereira: ok but what you want to do is still a bad idea - so like i said, try and find a PPA with a newer version provided in package form :)
[19:05] <TomyWork> lsfret wherein `date +%d%m%y` means "get the day, month and year and put it in the string
[19:05] <lsfret> this ubuntu probably took ages to make it
[19:06] <EriC^^> lsfret: ok, so why are you copying the whole drive?
[19:06] <TomyWork> lsfret  so you'll get something like /home/your_username/image2015-05-08.gz"
[19:06] <TomyWork> lsfret and yes, the GNU project started in the 80s
[19:06] <TomyWork> the linux kernel started in 1991
[19:06] <lsfret> EriC^^: I don't know/not sure. Just go after the stream. We'll see what I can do. Although I lazy to connect raspberry pi and transfer with ssh
[19:07] <daftykins> wow.
[19:07] <TomyWork> and the theoretical groundwork is from the 60s and 70s
[19:07] <daftykins> so this entire task is down to your own laziness?
[19:07] <daftykins> good to know

Whenever I boot up to my ubuntu partition with these 3 things connected, my mouse is frozen on screen and the keyboard does not work.  It has only happened once that I booted and everything was working properly. Any ideas?
[19:16] <abdo_losh> Evening all
[19:16] <daftykins> if you want cheering up, go to #ubuntu-offtopic
[19:16] <MonkeyDust> lsfret  ok, then this simple command should work   watch -n 1 sensors
[19:16] <lsfret> i think i typed it, u paste it again.
[19:16] <MonkeyDust> in a terminal
[19:16] <TomyWork> olabaz all usb i assume?
[19:16] <lsfret> Razor mouse :
[19:16] <lsfret> :D
[19:17] <lsfret> Oh no i think i copy the ubuntu live
[19:17] <TomyWork> olabaz  did you try varying the ports? does the problem occur on other operating systems or linux distros as well? tried a live cd of one?
[19:18] <TomyWork> anyway, going home. you've got things to try, good luck olabaz :)
[19:18] <olabaz> TomyWork, yes, they're all USB
[19:18] <olabaz> and they work fine on windows
[19:19] <olabaz> I don't have any other linux or cds to try though :

[19:23] <lsfret> Unplug and then plug work right?
[19:23] <abdo_losh> yeh i does then i dies again after a bit
[19:24] <lsfret> Hmm.. Maybe when it happen type this: 'dmesg' and paste it if you see something suspecious
[19:26] <abdo_losh> you know i tried a few work arounds including autosuspend=-1 at kernel boot command .. no chance
[19:26] <lsfret> My opinion that in windows you have the drivers..
[19:26] <abdo_losh> maybe
[19:27] <bekks> Did you even take a look at dmesg when that happens?
[19:27] <lsfret> can you paste the line of lsusb ?
[19:27] <abdo_losh> i just wonder why it works flawlessly on 13.04 / 10 but no luck with higher versions of Ubunt

[19:29] <m0r0n> Hello. I'm having issues with my nvidia drivers. Whenever I boot from sleep I get my login page, after I login my screen goes black. I opened up a terminal (with a blank screen using shortcuts) and ran sudo startx. I shutdown my computer by unplugging the battery, now whenever I try to login it looks like "startx" runs everytime I login. After logging in and seeing the nVidia logo it takes me back to my login page
[19:30] <OerHeks> m0r0n, uh oh, startx is depreciated, sudo service lightdm start is now current
[19:30] <daftykins> m0r0n: you've broken permissions by running startx, don't use it
[19:30] <abdo_losh> you want me to paste the whole output of dmesg here ?
[19:30] <daftykins> m0r0n: check your ~ for files not owned by your user.
[19:30] <daftykins> abdo_losh: good lord no. http://paste.ubuntu.com :P
[19:30] <lsfret> D=
[19:30] <abdo_losh> lol
[19:31] <m0r0n> daftykins, What do you mean by look for files not owned by my user?
[19:31] <abdo_losh> daftykins: thought not
[19:31] <daftykins> m0r0n: "ls -al ~" and look for files with root:root beside instead of user:user
[19:31] <m0r0n> Okay
[19:32] <lsfret> what did i just did:     sudo gzip -dc /home/your_username/image.gz | dd bs=4M of=/dev/sdb
[19:32] <cristian__> Hola, que signigica este error?  bash: /etc/bash.bashrc: Permiso denegado

[19:33] <lsfret> It not good?
[19:33] <lsfret> ;_; omg
[19:34] <m0r0n> daftykins, I'm not sure how to read this output to trace it to a file. I do see root:root though
[19:34] <daftykins> m0r0n: "ls -al ~ | pastebinit" then link me (you might need to install pastebinit
[19:35] <jpereira> daftykins,  yeah dude... configure/make/make install works fine! :)
[19:35] <abdo_losh> i need a tidy command for just usb snatch of dmesg please ?
[19:35] <likecolacola> is Counter-Strike playable in linux?
[19:35] <olabaz> cristian__, it has to be executable so it should be chmod to do that
[19:35] <abdo_losh> if it exists that is
[19:35] <daftykins> jpereira: good luck ever updating again
[19:36] <olabaz> cristian__, but if it says permission denied it's probably because you didn't run as sudo
[19:36] <m0r0n> daftykins, Didn't know pastebinit existed. Thanks. Here's the paste: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11030869/
[19:36] <OerHeks> likecolacola, in wine it should be https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CounterStrike
[19:36] <daftykins> m0r0n: ah no that's fine, root just means the folder above
[19:37] <jchmrt> A friend of mine is periodically getting crashes in which he gets errors like this when trying to run commands: "bash: /usr/bin/sudo: Input/output error" or "bash: /bin/ls: No such file or directory". We think that it is a issue with the drive, but it is brand new. Is there any reason apart from drive failure which could cause these type of problems?
[19:37] <abdo_losh> daftykins: dmesg has some ufw entries i dont want to share,  i need a tidy command for just usb snatch of dmesg please ?
[19:37] <daftykins> abdo_losh: best ask someone else then, i'm occupied

[19:38] <daftykins> jchmrt: get pastebinit and smartmontools installed, then get us a "sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdX | pastebinit" where sdX is the / disk.
[19:39] <mka> jchmrt: its likely to be drive failure
[19:39] <jchmrt> ok, will do. thanks

[20:49] <OerHeks> = ubuntu 14.10

[20:50] <basti> i have two screen sessions detached. when i want to access them i get this: WriteMessage: Bad file descriptor
[20:50] <basti> what is wrong?
[20:51] <Elec_A> ki7mt: release trusty-backports for cmake was not foound
[20:52] <fgrew> how do i move files with ssh?
[20:53] <ki7mt> Elec_A, That's a bugger then. Let me look in the package archives real quick.
[20:53] <guntbert> fgrew: from where to where?
[20:53] <fgrew> my client (from) ...
[20:53] <fgrew> i connect to ssh
[20:54] <ki7mt> Elec_A, Yup, it's not there. Either build from Source, it use a later .deb file is all I could suggest.
[20:54] <guntbert> fgrew: you don't "connect to ssh", you use ssh to connect to a server
[20:54] <ki7mt> Elec_A, or use a later . deb .. .. ..
[20:54] <fgrew> yes
[20:54] <fgrew> How do I copy files?
[20:54] <Elec_A> ki7mt: is there cmake's .deb file available ?
[20:54] <Elec_A> should i check cmake website
[20:54] <Elec_A> ?
[20:54] <tamps> Can some1 help me out. How can I copy from one file a line(file contain only one line) to another file line end. Whit command "paste file1 >> file2" but it will make an new line. I need to copy line to another file line end.
[20:55] <guntbert> fgrew: I ask again: from where to where do you want ot copy them?
[20:55] <bekks> tamps: cat file1 file2 > file12
[20:55] <fgrew> server to client
[20:55] <tamps> again, two new lines
[20:55] <ki7mt> Elec_A, Yes, I would check with KitWare .. I think there are, if not, building from sourse is pretty easy.
[20:55] <tamps> I need to copy to the same line.

[20:56] <monojin> Win 20.000? Don't you mean Win 2000?
[20:56] <bekks> SafeMoneyOnl: Do you have a specific Ubuntu support question?
[20:56] <geirha> tamps: paste file1 file2 > file3
[20:57] <fgrew> you mean in game not irlf
[20:57] <Elec_A> ki7mt: it seems it is available in kubuntu backports
[20:57] <tamps> is there an way to copy from first file to another file. that I dont need to greate an new file..
[20:58] <tamps> paste works, but then need to reconfigure my hardware every time..
[20:58] <ki7mt> Elec_A, That's going to give you 2.8.7 also, there's no back port for it i appears. Maybe Source build is the only option for 12.04. Kubuntu has 2.8.12 though.
[20:59] <Elec_A> ki7mt: isn't it ok to install kubuntu 2.8.12 on ubuntu ?
[20:59] <ki7mt> Elec_A, Sure, it's ok to install any of the DE's you want.
[21:00] <ki7mt> Elec_A, It jsut seems a bit overkill to get the latest Cmake though.
[21:00] <Elec_A> ki7mt: why ?
[21:00] <ki7mt> Elec_A, If it were fgor a newr Qt5 version or something, then I would understand, but Cmake is pretty small package.
[21:01] <Elec_A> ki7mt: so do you suggest installing it ?
[21:02] <ki7mt> Elec_A, I would built it from source, in /usr/local, having removed the distro cmake first, then test it out.
[21:02] <ki7mt> .. would build it ..
[21:02] <tamps> I need to make it that filename dont change.. something like this "paste info_to_copy >> File_to_paste" but I need it this way that it does not great new line.
[21:02] <ki7mt> Elec_A, Baring that, upgrade to 14.04 LTS, but that's overkill also.
[21:03] <InFlames> my ubuntu 14.04 doesn't handle returning windows to the main screen when the secondary is removed, it thinks there is still a second screen, anyone have any ideas?

=== badon_ is now known as badon
[21:08] <Elec_A> ki7mt: sorry , i don't know kitware
[21:08] <fearnothing> I used to think that linux IRC channels were unfriendly to newbs but maybe I've been hanging out in the wrong ones. I do have a question, it is as follows:
[21:08] <ki7mt> Elec_A, Kitware is the CMake developers
[21:08] <fearnothing> I've been setting up phpldapadmin, and I made a mistake in the initial configuration for the domain
[21:09] <fearnothing> basically missed off a field from $servers->setValue('server','base',array()
[21:09] <Elec_A> ki7mt: Oh , thank you. Ok i'll try their documents.
[21:09] <fearnothing> I've inserted the correct value and restarted apache and slapd, but the login page is still not loading the correct value
[21:10] <fearnothing> it logs me in if I manually give the correct domain
[21:10] <fearnothing> but it should fill that field in automatically and it isn't. Why not?
[21:10] <bazhang> !info phpldapadmin
[21:10] <ki7mt> Elec_A, Cmake is the Open-source version of their product.
[21:10] <ubottu> phpldapadmin (source: phpldapadmin): web based interface for administering LDAP servers. In component universe, is extra. Version 1.2.2-5.2 (vivid), package size 716 kB, installed size 4819 kB
[21:11] <ki7mt> Elec_A, There's also ParaView, vTK, iTK but that's outside what you need.
[21:11] <fearnothing> is that long form for "wrong channel"?
[21:12] <|aaron> since updating to 15.04 im having problems with chrome freezing... it will just completely stop responding to input for a minute or so. doesnt seem to matter what tabs i have open and ive got plenty of free system resources.. help?
[21:12] <lasko> fearnothing: You'll usually find that application specific issues will best be handled in application specific channels, generally if someone knows they an answer but sometimes not.
[21:13] <Elec_A> ki7mt: thank you :)
[21:13] <fearnothing> ok, do you know whether I should be looking for an ldap channel or specifically phpldapadmin?
[21:13] <tamps> Anyway to cat one file line to another file line end? eg: "cat cookie_id >> stream_playlist"
[21:13] <lasko> fearnothing: I honestly haven't a clue, you might ask for channel information in #php and see if someone knows there
=== ken is now known as Guest5311
[21:14] <fearnothing> that's an invite only chan
[21:14] <lasko> Oh weird
[21:14] <lasko> Umm..
[21:14] <lasko> maybe #phpmyadmin  ?
[21:15] <fearnothing> phpmyadmin includes ldap? that's the one that's included in LAMP right?
[21:16] <lasko> Well, what I mean to say is that -- that channel may have more answers on whom to ask.
[21:16] <fearnothing> ok
[21:16] <fearnothing> thanks :)
[21:16] <lasko> No problem, good luck

[21:23] <nonroot> hello, anyone who can tell me where i can find Wine IRC Channel for linux not mac?
[21:23] <tamps> Anyway to cat one file line to another file line end? eg: "cat cookie_id >> stream_playlist.m3u8" whitout greating an new file eg "paste cookie_id stream_playlist >> new playlist.m3u8" I do not want to make an new file.. only edit an exist file. Any help plz? :/
[21:23] <lasko> nonroot: It should just be #winehq
[21:24] <lasko> nonroot: If its not, they would be the better resource to ask
[21:24] <OerHeks> !wine
[21:24] <ubottu> WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux - More information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine - Search the !AppDB for application compatibility ratings - Join #winehq for application help - See !virtualizers for running Windows (or another OS) inside Ubuntu
[21:24] <nonroot> ty
[21:25] <nonroot> im all ready in WineHQ channel, but thanks anyway
[21:25] <OerHeks> It would be the same channel, linux/mac.
[21:27] <tamps> Got it. Using "sed 'N;s/\n/ /' filename" to merge two lines into one. Thank you geirha for the hint (Y)
[21:32] <torak4897> quit
[21:33] <fearnothing> nevermind, found the answer
[21:33] <fearnothing> the domain setting is duplicated in the config.php file, it was the other one which affected the login page.

[21:43] <ki7mt> woodennails, Is this a dualboot or native Linux installation ?
[21:45] <katronix> Hi all, I have an Ubuntu server that I want to run https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf on, which unfortunately requires portions of X Windows. I know generally its not a good idea to install X on a server, however is there someway to see the minimum this app requires and install just that?
[21:47] <woodennails> ki7mt, native
[21:47] <Spec-Chum> woodennails, I do that, I've got Ubunut on my SSD then use my NTFS drives for storage and just link the folders
[21:47] <Spec-Chum> Ubuntu
[21:48] <Spec-Chum> I can, for example, download something on windows and us it in Linux and vice versa
[21:48] <Spec-Chum> *use
[21:48] <Spec-Chum> woodennails, welcome to the wonderful world of Linux :)
[21:48] <Jordan_U> katronix: "wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage are command line tools to render HTML into PDF and various image formats using the QT Webkit rendering engine. These run entirely "headless" and do not require a display or display service."
[21:49] <ki7mt> woodennails, for me, the easiest way to access NTFS drives is via Samba, but if you have no plans on going back to Windows, you may want to back up the files, and convert them to EXT4 and create mount points for them, then add the drives to your FSTAB
[21:49] <reisio> s/QT/Qt/
[21:49] <katronix> Jordan_U, yes, however if you try to install it it does need the fonts xfonts-base and xfonts-75dpi
[21:50] <Suek0> hi
[21:50] <reisio> katronix: and those draw in X?
[21:50] <reisio> Suek0: heyo
[21:50] <Spec-Chum> ki7mt, I'm curious, why via samba?
[21:50] <Jordan_U> katronix: OK, so install those.
[21:50] <Spec-Chum> why not just use mount them ntfs-3g?
[21:51] <ki7mt> Spec-Chum, It's just quick and easy. But I also use SSHFS.
[21:51] <Spec-Chum> ki7mt, oh, they're networked drives?
[21:51] <ki7mt> Spec-Chum, Some are, some are native.
[21:52] <katronix> Jordan_U, instead of apt-get telling me everything having that has dependencies can I tell it to get everything needed to run whatever?
[21:52] <ki7mt> Spec-Chum, Like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11032536/
[21:52] <katronix> xfonts-base : Depends: xfonts-utils (>= 1:7.5+2)
[21:53] <Spec-Chum> fair enough :)
[21:59] <Jordan_U> katronix: apt-get can only resolve dependencies for things that you install via .deb packages, but if you "sudo apt-get install xfonts-base" it will install xfonts base and all of its dependencies and recommendations. If you want to just install xfont-base's dependencies but not recommendations then you can use "sudo apt-get install xfonts-base --no-recommends".
[22:00] <katronix> Jordan_U, thanks
[22:00] <Jordan_U> katronix: You're welcome.
[22:02] <katronix> Jordan_U, is it possible to ask dpkg where a file will be installed at?
[22:02] <geirha> tamps: Ah was that the goal? then this is another solution:  paste - - < file1 > file2

[23:29] <JFlash> suddenly I can no longer resize my windows by dragging on the edges
[23:29] <JFlash> I have too much stuff going on to be able to reboot
[23:29] <JFlash> any quick fix that doesnt require me to reboot/
[23:29] <JFlash> ?
[23:29] <LinuxFan47> Are ya runnincompiz?
[23:30] <LinuxFan47> Runnin compiz
[23:30] <LinuxFan47> That might be it
[23:30] <JFlash> vanilla latest ubuntu
[23:30] <JFlash> so probably yes
[23:31] <JFlash> ah now what
[23:31] <JFlash> I remember I have some sort of program that supposedly tiles your windows
[23:31] <LinuxFan47> That should help
[23:31] <JFlash> and i clicked inadvertly on it a few times, just by mistake
[23:31] <JFlash> no I think it's the culprit
[23:32] <JFlash> I should try and kill its process
[23:32] <JFlash> how do I kill x-tile?
[23:32] <LinuxFan47> Look for system monitor and run it and look for x-tile
[23:33] <JFlash> i think i'm running unity
[23:34] <JFlash> because there are a lot of unity things listed
[23:34] <JFlash> is that the same thing as compiz?
[23:34] <LinuxFan47> Not that I am aware.

[23:37] <Firevenant> hi noone
[23:37] <LinuxFan47> lol
[23:38] <Firevenant> can i ask you a question Noone?
[23:38] <LinuxFan47> I am here tryin to get bluetooth workin
[23:38] <LinuxFan47> Sure
[23:38] <Firevenant> aw shit :(
[23:38] <Firevenant> great!
[23:38] <guardianx> jhk
[23:39] <Firevenant> ok, so...i want to refresh my windows machine( win 8.1) and i'm not sure if it will delete Ubuntu (it's on another partition but i've already fiddled with my electronic stuff so much(and broke it) that i'm scared of deleting Ubuntu
[23:40] <Firevenant> Got any idea of what will happen? just the Win 8.1 reinstalling and not deleting the other partition?
[23:40] <LinuxFan47> refresh as arestore of WIndows 8?
[23:40] <Firevenant> yes!
[23:41] <LinuxFan47> Once you restore WIn 8 it will go back to defaults and ubuntu won't be seen.  Did you nstall it via wubi?
[23:41] <LinuxFan47> Did you install ubuntu using wubi install I meant.
[23:42] <Firevenant> i installed with a Dvd
[23:42] <Firevenant> from the official download shit
[23:42] <Firevenant> i'm scared because a guy who knows about Ubuntu stuff told me something about damaging the Boot order or some shit
[23:42] <Firevenant> if i deleted ubuntu*
[23:43] <LinuxFan47> If you delete ubuntu you will need to reset the boot back to the WIndows boot if it installed the grub boot.
[23:44] <Firevenant> i see
[23:44] <LinuxFan47> But doin a system restore of WIndows8 will fix the boot and only shhow windows and safe to remove Uuntu
[23:44] <LinuxFan47> Ubuntu
[23:44] <Firevenant> i don't want to remove Ubuntu tho
[23:44] <LinuxFan47> What are ya tryin to do?
[23:44] <mkanyicy> Firevenant: so what do you want to do then?
[23:45] <Firevenant> refresh wangdows
[23:45] <Firevenant> without removing Ubuntu or any other partitions
[23:45] <mkanyicy> Firevenant: what do you mean by 'refresh windows'?
[23:46] <Firevenant> there's an option in windows 8.1 which says "refresh: re-install all windows *stuff* while keeping your personal files"
[23:46] <Jordan_U> Firevenant: Join ##windows, and have them walk through installing Windows without removing Ubuntu's partitions. If after that you can't boot Ubuntu, come back here and we'll help you get Ubuntu booting again. Note that Windows' default (if I recall correctly) *is* to whipe the entire drive, so you will need to be careful not to accidentally do that.
[23:46] <Firevenant> thank you!
[23:46] <Jordan_U> Firevenant: You're welcome.

[23:53] <xangua> olabaz: you might wanna check TLP (you need to add third party repository) http://www.webupd8.org/2013/04/improve-power-usage-battery-life-in.html
[23:54] <olabaz> xangua, hmm, I'm wondering because some of my usb ports don't work and I read online about an autosuspend
[23:55] <xangua> olabaz: if they didn't work from the beggining don't think my suggestion helps
