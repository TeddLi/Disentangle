<s> i do have a vm of xp it deserves being there , lol </s>
<s> <user> : btw clonezilla just finished the disk to disk clone and i have all the other space unallocated , with ubuntu and gparted i know there wo n't be a problem expanding the partition but for windows to expand it do you recommend like you said earlier to use disk manager ? </s>
<s> <user> , first i do n't use clonezilla that way i save the image to a external then reload it , i have seen another have problems that way , it may have been you . but see if it boots and resize it with its partitioner . if you had saved that with packets you could have a partition already there and not have to resize using clonezilla . </s>
<s> <user> : it did boot , all was fine , it 's like the old hdd , and it just has the extra space <unka> . </s>
<s> <unka> ... kerberos is messing with my head </s>
<s> <user> , cool , the onboard has a resize option i think it will allow you to expand it into the unallocated . </s>
<s> <user> : i never resized with clonezilla . it was a weird thing that happened , clonezilla said there will be new partitions with no unallocated space but now i see it lied and all the extra space is unallocated . </s>
<s> <user> : yep </s>
<s> <user> , i meant using clonezilla , it is designed when saving in packages to be put in an equal or larger partition . </s>
<s> <user> : btw , does it matter if i defrag first and then expand or i can defrag after expanding . it shouldnt matter right , since the expansion will just be seen as empty space . </s>
<s> <user> , i doubt that disc is fully <unka> that full . </s>
<s> software-centre wo n't open with an invalid ppa in the sources list </s>
<s> how can i reinstall all the default stuff in a package and have it overwrite all the configs , etc </s>
<s> <user> : yeah , it only has 1gb left rofl </s>
<s> <user> , resize with a couple of hail <unka> . </s>
<s> ;) </s>
<s> <user> : yeah im giving it double of what it has now </s>
<s> <user> , in synaptic find the package and say remove completely </s>
<s> how do i do it with apt-get </s>
<s> do n't know </s>
<s> <user> , sounds more like a broken upgrade . </s>
<s> <user> : is the 50% space available partition thing you mentioned earlier valid for ext4 as well ? </s>
<s> <user> , what is command to <unka> ? </s>
<s> <user> , that is just my default , i have extensive external hd space so i pretty much just have the os 's on the hd . </s>
<s> <user> , apt-get purge </s>
<s> <user> , man apt-get </s>
<s> hey guys , where would i have to ask questions about nvidia related graphics card stuff ? </s>
<s> <user> , i have seen 70 % is about the most you want , but many will argue both sides on this , i just go the low end and have externals so i do n't lose anything ever . </s>
<s> <user> , thanks </s>
<s> <user> : i ca n't extend volume with disk management btw there is no unallocated space on the right of partition ( and extend volume is greyed out ) </s>
<s> <user> , what questions do you have ? </s>
<s> <user> : so i guess gparted it is :( </s>
<s> <user> : well , they removed the overscan setting in the nvidia control center and that 's why i ca n't control the position of my hdmi picture anymore , i 'm clueless what to do now . </s>
<s> <user> , you have to have an unallocated to expand it , i would resize the linux leaving the unallocated for the windows resize . </s>
<s> resize the linux with gparted , windows ca n't do it . </s>
