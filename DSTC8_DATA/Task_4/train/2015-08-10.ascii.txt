[22:10] <the_count_> Oerheks: Lenovo yoga 2 Pro has major resume problems amongse other things that aren't fixed by the new kernel
[22:13] <OerHeks> ah i see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lightdm/+bug/1465974
[22:13] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1465974 in lightdm (Ubuntu) "LightDM lock screen unresponsive after resume from suspend (Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro)" [Undecided,New]
[22:13] <Guest15560> daftykins: ok. I used sudo mkdosfs -F 32 -I /dev/sdb and that bring it alive again :D
[22:14] <Bashing-om> the_count_: Looks to be rather iffy. Test now that you have vivid's stack installed. This kernel supports newer hardware and has many fixes . IF you must yoga-laptop. I would do so from a dual boot .
[22:16] <the_count_> Bashing-om: Ok, I might try that, and another question, I installed ubuntu and shrunk my windows partition, neglecting to disable fastboot in windows, do you have any Idea how to fix that?
[22:17] <NGC3982> How can i make subbot auth with nickserv?
[22:17] <k1l_> NGC3982: #freenode for questions about the network
[22:18] <NGC3982> It's actually neither ubuntu or the network, afaik.
[22:18]  * NGC3982 tries to find someone somewhere who knows about this.
[22:19] <OerHeks> the_count_, if you didn't disable fastboot, you could not install ubuntu, nor boot from usb/sdcard.
[22:20] <the_count_> OerHeks: But, I still did install Ubuntu with FastBoot enamled
[22:20] <handson> Hi
[22:21] <the_count_> Oerheks: Maybe it is not supposed to happed, but I was able to do it.
[22:21] <the_count_> happen
[22:21] <OerHeks> I guess, you would not have seen any windows partition, and ubuntu used it all, in a non uefi install ?
[22:22] <Bashing-om> the_count_: I am not Windows literate, but Windows fast boot is "hibernation" . IF you are too boot linux then make sure Windows is shut down properly .
[22:22] <stubblefield> k1l_: that doesn't work i tried going way back in versions
[22:22] <stubblefield> also grub itself shows up at the smaller resolution which is not normal
[22:24] <the_count_> Bashing-om: I recently installed linux, I shrunk the windows partition with gparted without disabling fastboot, I was able to then install linux. I was wondering how to recover my windows partition now that I messed it up
[22:28] <stubblefield> there's no difference in the current and old Xorg logs except 1024 vs 1366
[22:28] <Bashing-om> the_count_: That I think is a UEFI thing .. TJ-, erric^^ ot ithers are better qualified to offer advise. If Windows is installed UEFI and ubuntu MBR on the same hard drive, the two boot schemes are not compatible. But I do know it is fixable .
[22:29] <stubblefield> i wonder if the monitor is damaged or something
[22:29] <stubblefield> or the cable
[22:30] <the_count_> Bashing-om: Thanks for your help, I'll get it figured out one of these days, it's not super important rightnow.
[22:31] <Bashing-om> the_count_: If ya want to boot Windows, it is important .
[22:33] <the_count_> Bashing-om: I don't have any pressing need now, i have got along for three months now, and liking Linux, I had a friend at school that told me all year that I should be using linux and I think I finally made the switch...
[22:33] <the_count_> Bashing-om: I don't have anything important there currently.
=== offsec is now known as Guest61642
[22:40] <Agent1918> I'm curious does anyone know how to install Linux on a UEFI system? I can't for the life of me figured that out. It's been some time since I've tried but not sure if there has since been a workaround.
[22:40] <Bashing-om> the_count_: :) I ditched Windows 10 years back - or so ; I have never looked back .
[22:41] <the_count_> Bashing-om, I think that'll be me too, and I hope you know, WIndows 10 wasn't around years ago...
[22:42] <kolombo> Agent1918, nothing special. just use an installation media created EFI compatible
[22:42]  * wileee evilly cackles while looks at the channel in w10
[22:43] <daftykins> !efi | Agent1918 pretty basic
[22:43] <ubottu> Agent1918 pretty basic: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[22:43] <Bashing-om> the_count_: Different strokes for different folks. My wife recently upgraded to Win10 - graphics work station and Adobe in 'buntu was not cutting it - she likes Win10 .
[22:44] <wileee> Bashing-om, Had to a resize in winders so doing an image, than back to home linux. ;)
[22:44] <the_count_> Bashing-om: I agree, I would like to try out Windows 10 though, see how it works, etc..
[22:46] <Agent1918> Alright, thanks.
[22:46] <Agent1918> I'll check it out.
[22:49] <the_count_> Anyone here use irssi?
[22:49] <Bashing-om> the_count_: I do  use irssi .
[22:50] <the_count_> Bashing-om, I just found it a while ago, how do you use it?
[22:50] <Bashing-om> wileee: Is a clutton for punishment . But he has hope yet .

[22:55] <the_count> Bashing-om: How do you view links from irssi?
[22:55] <Bashing-om> the_count: copy and paste .
[22:55] <bekks> the_count: copy and paste, into the browser of your choice.
[22:56] <LtL> the_count: right-click, choose open link
[22:57] <Bashing-om> the_count: On my system in irssi, a double click on the link "copies" .
[22:58] <LtL> I can't imagine having to copy/paste to open a hyperlink.
[23:00] <LtL> i also use irssi btw
[23:01] <LtL> unless your in a non-gui environment however, you would have to copy/paste i imagine
[23:04] <Bashing-om> LtL: Nope, right click highlights much more than the link for me in my irssi client. For me a double click on the link to copy .
[23:05] <LtL> Bashing-om: if i hover over a proper link, right-click... i get  a menu, i choose open link. ymmv
[23:07] <LtL> my mouse buttons are reversed, but i think right-click is the one, it's left for me.
[23:08] <LtL> id shoot myself if i had to copy/paste but thats just me :)
[23:09] <Bashing-om> LtL: Maybe the version, as I am still holding onto " Irssi: Client: irssi 0.8.15 (20100403 1617) " :)
[23:11] <LtL> Bashing-om: i've used irssi for years, they all do it, this i 0.8.17, debian's oem version does it as well as the backport, i cant remember it ever not working
[23:13] <LtL> Bashing-om: its really odd yours doesn't
[23:16] <Bashing-om> LtL: The terminal that irssi is running in has alot to do with it .
[23:18] <LtL> Bashing-om: i was just going to suggest that
[23:18] <LtL> i'm strictly a gnome guy, tried them all
[23:20] <Bashing-om> LtL: :) I prefer light and functional . If I do not use it, I do not want it on my system. ( xterm ) for my terminal .
[23:22] <LtL> Bashing-om: good logic indeed

[23:48] <OerHeks> aruns, i know, it messed up your system beyond repair.
[23:49] <EriC^^> aruns: what does it say?
[23:49] <aruns> Do I have to reinstall whole ubuntu 14.04 from scratch?
[23:50] <Bashing-om> aruns: ^^ What he says , The heart has been ripped out, Much better to (re-)install to have a solid stable system ( not to mention much much faster ) .
[23:50] <aruns> EriC^^, OerHeks , Do I have to reinstall whole ubuntu 14.04 from scratch?
[23:50] <EriC^^> aruns: what does the error say? i think somebody bounced right back up from removing python the other day
[23:51] <EriC^^> sudo apt-get install python , what does it say?
[23:51] <SolarNRG> hi
[23:51] <SolarNRG> is ubuntu better than mint?
[23:51] <EriC^^> actually i think it would have removed other packages as well, i guess a reinstall is better
[23:52] <Bashing-om> !better | SolarNRG
[23:52] <EriC^^> unless you get the list of packages it removed and reinstall them ( /var/log/apt/history.log )
[23:52] <LizardmanSC> How do i install Ubuntu? Is it even safe my friend trying to scare me again saying i'll get lock ups and that it might not install it may give an error on installaton because i am on UEFI..
[23:52] <OerHeks> EriC^^, all the logs are on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2289974
[23:52] <OerHeks> i think you missed that
[23:53] <EriC^^> LizardmanSC: it's pretty safe as long as you have an idea about what you're doing
[23:53] <LizardmanSC> would i get errors or would it be safer to just put the computer in legacy bios mode and allow ubuntu to remove windows
[23:53] <Bashing-om> !uefi | LizardmanSC
[23:53] <ubottu> LizardmanSC: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[23:53] <LizardmanSC> eriC^^ i know how to install systems.. I've done it with windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, xp, and ubuntu 10.10
[23:53] <EriC^^> uefi works fine with ubuntu, read the above ^
[23:53] <SolarNRG> lizardmansc, today I've already installed debian and mint, was considering red hat next, debian's got hardly no gpu driver support, mint is spyware like windows 10 I got banned from mint for accusing the devs of being nsa pawns because they won't share the root password that is on every mint copy
[23:54] <SolarNRG> I'm now considering ubuntu because ati supports drivers for it
[23:54] <LizardmanSC> SolarNRG is it pretty easy to remove as well?
[23:54] <EriC^^> thanks OerHeks
[23:54] <SolarNRG> if i were you id make like 4 partitions on your hard drive and test drive a few linuxes so if you ever screw up one copy you've got another backup copy you can fix the other with without having to spend hours reinstallign debian jesse the millionth time
[23:55] <SolarNRG> as long as you don't touch windows 10 you're cool
[23:55] <daftykins> that's rubbish
[23:56] <aruns> EriC^^, OerHeks :sudo apt-get install python > http://paste.ubuntu.com/12044584/
[23:56] <OerHeks> but my experience is that removal of python 2.7x is a disaster. manually downloading packages from an other machine as you cannot get a secure connection someway
[23:56] <SolarNRG> can i go su in ubuntu?
[23:56] <SolarNRG> mint won't let me
[23:56] <SolarNRG> I think that's evil
[23:57] <daftykins> SolarNRG: support questions only, no paranoid delusions please
[23:57] <EriC^^> aruns: type sudo dpkg --purge --force-remove-reinstreq ntop
[23:57] <aruns> OerHeks, Yes you are right its actually disaster, I paid heavily for it. my gnome and everything imp working environment is reduced to ashes
[23:58] <SolarNRG> This is not a paranoid delusion, if I can't get root access to my own hardware I paid for that to me is a serious security risk
[23:58] <daftykins> you're showing an obvious misunderstanding of how root functions on ubuntu and its' derivatives
[23:58] <daftykins> !root
[23:58] <ubottu> Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[23:58] <xangua> !noroot | SolarNRG
[23:58] <ubottu> SolarNRG: We do not support setting a root password. You're free to do it on your own machine, but please don't offer instructions on how to set a root password or ask for help with setting it. See !root and !wfm for more information.
[23:59] <SolarNRG> !root
[23:59] <daftykins> no, the factoids are already above - no need to type the bot triggers again
[23:59] <SolarNRG> are you telling me that ubuntu also doesn't let you have root access just like mint?
[00:00] <aruns> EriC^^, OerHeks : sudo dpkg --purge --force-remove-reinstreq ntop > output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/12044612/
[00:01] <daftykins> SolarNRG: no, you don't know how to use it is all.
[00:01] <OerHeks> it is all part of the security-network-auth, maybe you cannot even ping your host.
[00:01] <SolarNRG> daftykins: ok in debian I go su, it asks me for a password bam, I'm superuser I can do whatever I want
[00:02] <daftykins> yeah, same with ubuntu and Mint - only "sudo -i" instead
[00:02] <SolarNRG> in mint I go su it asks me for a password but I never had the chance to set it
[00:02] <OerHeks> SolarNRG, the ubuntu way is: sudo -i # for that terminal session only.
[00:02] <daftykins> SolarNRG: so i would recommend that you do some reading to understand how to use it, instead of just kicking up a big fuss claiming these paranoid ideas.
[00:02] <daftykins> you do not use 'su' on ubuntu and its' derivatives.
[00:02] <SolarNRG> when i install ubuntu, will i get the option to set my own root password?
[00:02] <daftykins> no because it's not designed to be used with a root password.
[00:03] <OerHeks> no, that is answered already with the urls
[00:03] <SolarNRG> so is sudo -i the same thing as su in debian?
[00:03] <daftykins> no
[00:03] <SolarNRG> what's the difference?
[00:03] <daftykins> you need to do some reading up on sudo :)
[00:04] <aruns> Is reinstallation of ubuntu only solution left
[00:04] <xangua> SolarNRG: please read what the bot said already up
[00:04] <aruns> Does any way can fix this problem
[00:04] <EriC^^> aruns: try sudo dpkg --remove --force-all ntop
[00:04] <LizardmanSC> SolarNRG is it easy to remove though?
[00:05] <SolarNRG> LizardmanSC: if you don't mind formatting your hard drive and losing your data, no it's very easy
[00:05] <SolarNRG> what os are you using currently?
[00:05] <LizardmanSC> I'd only partition it :3
[00:05] <LizardmanSC> I'm windows 8.1
[00:07] <aruns> EriC^^, sudo dpkg --remove --force-all ntop > http://paste.ubuntu.com/12044642/
[00:07] <daftykins> LizardmanSC: you could just try ubuntu from a flash drive to start with, no reason to install immediately
[00:07] <OerHeks> aruns, is that service still running? sudo service ntop stop
[00:08] <SolarNRG> is it hard to split partition an ntfs file system so some of the disk is ext4?
[00:08] <daftykins> SolarNRG: resize it from Windows
[00:08] <EriC^^> aruns: also try sudo rm -f /var/lib/dpkg/info/atftpd.*
[00:08] <aruns> sudo service ntop stop
[00:08] <aruns> /etc/init.d/ntop: 3: /var/lib/ntop/init.cfg: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string
[00:08] <SolarNRG> might be smart to do a defrag on windows first
[00:09] <LEO037> Hi, I have a problem. I'm trying to install the latest version of ubuntu via usb, but when I select and choose install, the pc restart and everything starts over. Someone had the same problem and know how to solve it? (hope I don't disturb)
[00:09] <EriC^^> aruns: sorry, sudo rm -f /var/lib/dpkg/info/ntop.*
[00:09] <EriC^^> ignore the previous command
[00:10] <daftykins> LEO037: hash your download and remake your flash drive, it could be bad.

[00:24] <finetundra_> hi folks, I'm having an issue where my internet stuff isn't starting at boot. Anyone know what's up?
[00:24] <daftykins> still nice and vague finetundra_ :) is this a desktop install?
[00:24] <EriC^^> aruns: type nano ~/packages, and go to http://termbin.com/5z5c and copy and paste the packages there, then type xargs -a ~/packages sudo apt-get install --reinstall
[00:24] <finetundra_> daftykins: laptop. Sorry for being vague.
[00:24] <marco_> ubuntu misdetects my headphones and i only get audio on left channel. How do i change that?
[00:25] <aruns> EriC^^: Okay, but i dont understand its relevance still
[00:25] <daftykins> finetundra_: yeah but ubuntu desktop?
[00:25] <daftykins> GUI etc
[00:25] <finetundra_> daftykins: KDE
[00:25] <daftykins> ok so kubuntu desktop
[00:25] <EriC^^> aruns: ctrl+a to select all, shift+ctrl+v to paste, ctrl+o to save
[00:25] <finetundra_> daftykins: yeah
[00:25] <finetundra_> I guess
[00:25] <EriC^^> aruns: those are the packages that got removed with python
[00:25] <bratchley> is there a way to resize my Ubuntu install? I want to try to dual boot with a different distro alongside but when I setup Ubuntu I used the whole HDD
[00:25] <finetundra_> It's on a laptop thhough
[00:25] <daftykins> finetundra_: do you have your network manager icon?
[00:26] <daftykins> lol that doesn't matter.
[00:26] <finetundra_> yeah
[00:26] <Melio> bratchley, of course, you can run gparted and move stuff around
[00:26] <aruns> EriC^^ : okay , WOnderful
[00:26] <bratchley> Melio: do I have to boot from DVD or something?
[00:26] <Melio> typically yes
[00:26] <daftykins> finetundra_: so what happens when you try to look at available wireless networks, or plug a network cable in and make use of it?
[00:26] <Melio> but if you are installing to dual boot. windows goes on first. then linux
[00:27] <finetundra_> daftykins: nothing. Doesn't detect anything
[00:27] <Melio> and make sure you plan your partitions ahead of time because it makes for less work
[00:27] <finetundra_> I asked in the kubuntu chat the other day and was told to run sudo modprobe iwlwifi, but that's only good till reboot
[00:28] <daftykins> finetundra_: alright but it *does* work?
[00:28] <finetundra_> daftykins: after the command yeah
[00:28] <daftykins> finetundra_: ok so put iwlwifi on its' own line in /etc/modules and it'll load on each boot.
[00:29] <OerHeks> bratchley, yes, boot the live iso and use gparted.
[00:32] <marco_> i only get sound on the left channel when using headphones. how do i fix that?
[00:32] <finetundra_> daftykins: ok, that worked.
[00:32] <aruns> EriC^^: But the problem is termbin.com is banned by Indian government, Hence can you use pastebin to copy content of termbin.com
[00:32] <finetundra_> but now I'm curious, how did this happen in the first place?
[00:32] <daftykins> finetundra_: no idea.
[00:33] <daftykins> your machine sounds crazy
[00:33] <finetundra_> daftykins: sounds about right
[00:33] <finetundra_> probably is at this point
[00:33] <daftykins> perhaps you're running a non-standard kernel?

[00:34] <finetundra_> daftykins: kernel is 3.13.0-58-generic
[00:34] <EriC^^> aruns: this is better http://pastebin.com/JAc5mCQ2
[00:34] <EriC^^> it's easier to copy
[00:34] <daftykins> finetundra_: hmm so close to being up to date
[00:34] <daftykins> i'm on -61 here
[00:36] <finetundra_> daftykins: I don't see a kernel update listed in the software updater
[00:36] <EriC^^> avilba: xinput can disable it
[00:36] <daftykins> use dist-upgrade from the terminal
[00:37] <finetundra_> daftykins: that would run an upgrade no?
[00:37] <FearDread> Greetings ubuntu
[00:37] <finetundra_> to a different version such as 15.04
[00:37] <finetundra_> ?
[00:37] <daftykins> finetundra_: no.
[00:37] <FearDread> Anyone know solution to fixing a missing /sbin/init file
[00:37] <daftykins> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[00:37] <FearDread> ?
[00:37] <avilba> EriC^^: thanks, I'll have a look there
[00:37] <FearDread> this is my last hope as im looking at hardware failure
[00:37] <compdoc> FearDread, where did it come from?
[00:38] <finetundra_> daftykins: command not found
[00:38] <FearDread> @ compdoc on boot
[00:38] <xpistos> Ok well using the 14.04.3 usb didn't connect wither so. could there be something else? like daftykins said maybe 14.04.3 only uses a version of WPA my router doesn't like?
[00:38] <FearDread> even when booting into recovery it gives me missing /sbin/init error
[00:38] <compdoc> its an ubuntu system file?
[00:38] <FearDread> aye
[00:38] <compdoc> can you boot the live dvd?
[00:38] <FearDread> belive ubunut uses the init file for startup scripts
[00:38] <FearDread> aye
[00:38] <daftykins> xpistos: no, not the OS - the *driver* for your wireless card
[00:39] <compdoc> what dose SMART say about the drive?
[00:39] <FearDread> ran fsck on the enitre partition and fixed all blocks and inodes with errors
[00:39] <compdoc> does
[00:39] <FearDread> even mounted the partition and copied the /sbin/init file from the live cd
[00:39] <EriC^^> FearDread: it's a part of upstart
[00:39] <FearDread> correct
[00:39] <daftykins> FearDread: boot a live session and share the SMART info from your disk.
[00:39] <xpistos> daftykins: I had 12.04 installed on it first and that worked with the proprietary driver
[00:39] <xpistos> daftykins: I am checking what this one is
[00:40] <daftykins> that's nice
[00:41] <FearDread> I ran SMART disk util and its reporting iminent harddisk failure, but not sure how thats possible with a WD white label hardrive thats not even 4 years old.  Its probably just a failing disk, wanted to tripple check though lol
[00:42] <FearDread> is there an option in the fsck command to force all rewrites, meaning i dont want to manually hit "yes" everytime
[00:42] <FearDread> it asks for a rewite
[00:42] <FearDread> rewrite ^
[00:43] <daftykins> FearDread: boot a live session and come back.
[00:43] <daftykins> FearDread: attempting an fsck on a drive in that state is utterly silly
[00:44] <daftykins> in fact i'd use stronger words to describe what that action is, in normal circumstances
[00:44] <FearDread> im on different computer, but im pretty sure the drive is just going bad, thanx guys
[00:44] <FearDread> time to replace my HD, sigh* what a pain in the butt
[00:44] <daftykins> so show the smartctl output
[00:44] <daftykins> sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdX
[00:45] <daftykins> no point running fsck at all
[00:45] <compdoc> its probably   /dev/sda
[00:45] <daftykins> of course it probably is.
[00:46] <xpistos> daftykins: Ok. It says I am using a prop driver "Broadcom 802.11 Linux STA wireless driver source from bmcwl-kernel-source (proprietary). the other option is do not use this device, but then it has now wireless option.
[00:46] <daftykins> xpistos: and what model of broadcom is it?
[00:47] <xpistos> daftykins: have to check it. One second. It is in a lenovo twist s230u
[00:47] <daftykins> check with lspci
[00:48] <xpistos> daftykins: Broadcom Corporation BCM43228 802.11a/b/g/n
[00:49] <daftykins> !broadcom | xpistos ok go nuts...
[00:49] <ubottu> xpistos ok go nuts...: Help with Broadcom bcm43xx can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
[00:49] <xpistos> daftykins: LOL. Thanks!
[00:49] <daftykins> but bear in mind it sounds like you didn't even try changing channel
[00:49] <daftykins> try 1, 6 or 11.
[00:49] <xpistos> I did
[00:49] <xpistos> no luck there
[00:49] <xpistos> I usually use 11 but tried 1, 6 and 9
[00:50] <daftykins> ok.
[00:51] <xpistos> daftykins: now I need to find it for a 14.04 system
[00:51] <daftykins> xpistos: ok you can stop keeping me updated now
[00:51] <avilba> I am trying to play with xinput, but I have trouble sorting out which device is my laptop keyboard... Can anyone help me read this : http://pastebin.com/t3awbaUN ? Thanks !
[00:52] <EriC^^> avilba: try xinput --disable "Virtual core keyboard"
[00:53] <avilba> Oh ok this one then. Thanks. I'll try to figure out a way to put it back on before trying to disable it !
[00:53] <EriC^^> or xinput --disable "Virtual core XTEST keyboard"
[00:56] <EriC^^> avilba: make a .desktop file and +x it
[00:56] <EriC^^> with Exec=xinput --enable "Virtual core XTEST keyboard"
[00:56] <EriC^^> so you can double click it to execute it
[00:57] <avilba> Ok cool thank you for that.
[00:57] <EriC^^> use /usr/share/applications to get a template
[00:58] <EriC^^> np
[01:06] <avilba> EriC^^ : when I try to disable the KB, xinput tells me "X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)". I guess that means I should use sudo, but what about my .desktop file to turn it on ? Is it gonna ask for my password as well ?
[01:08] <EriC^^> avilba: that's odd
[01:09] <avilba> EriC^^, I tried 'xinput --disable "Virtual core XTEST keyboard"'
[01:09] <EriC^^> it doesn't work here either, i guess you have to go about it differently, i've only used it with the touchpad
[01:10] <EriC^^> avilba: try xinput --disable "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"
[01:10] <ubuntu-mate> jemand aus deutschland da
[01:11] <avilba> EriC^^, Perfect ! You got it. Thanks a lot.
[01:13] <shifty36> what up
[01:16] <EriC^^> avilba: great, no problem!

[01:23] <gott3rfunk3n83> Arial
[01:24] <halnex> no Arial in xchat
[01:24] <halnex> I'm gonna settle with Droid Sans 11 for now

[01:25] <hggdh> byobu
=== sins-_o is now known as sins-
[01:34] <ronnel> I can't boot with Live USB anymore. Before, I was able to test drive distros, and managed to settle with Xubuntu Trusty. After some time, when I decided to test Kubuntu Vivid out, it just goes to a black screen / the monitor is off. I've tried other distros (Kubuntu Trusty, Manjaro), same result. I tried the original ISO I used to install Xubuntu Trusty before, but unfortunately, same thing happens. Why can I no longer use LiveUSBs?
[01:35] <daftykins> you're either making them up wrong, or you need to boot with nomodeset
[01:35] <daftykins> !nomodeset
[01:35] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[01:35] <viswanath> hi
[01:36] <artois> hi vis
[01:37] <ronnel> I tried nomodeset, acpi=off, basically those boot options. It goes to a terminal asking for login, but when I try to "startx", it can't connect to X Server. Tried Ctrl+Alt+F7, it shows up a blank.
[01:37] <daftykins> ronnel: yeah you're definitely making up the drive wrong, or it's damaged.
[01:37] <daftykins> or your downloads are corrupt
[01:38] <daftykins> OR your systems RAM is a little funky :)
[01:40] <ronnel> The weird thing is why can't I live boot with the original ISO I used to install Xubuntu in my netbook. Yes, my netbook's slow (HP Mini 1000) and Win7 sucks so I switched to Linux. I tried VirtualBox, it boots though, it goes to the Try/Install option. (But wasn't able to get past that since VirtualBox is killing my resources).
[01:40] <daftykins> virtualbox is nowhere near the same as booting natively
[01:41] <daftykins> it may be the same ISO, but it's not the same exact state of flash drive since you say you keep distro hopping
[01:41] <daftykins> so maybe zero the drive and try again, dd'ing the ISO on
[01:41] <daftykins> beyond that, try the things i've suggested
[01:41] <daftykins> you're not going to make any progress just blindly asking why.
[01:43] <knight2> hi bro
[01:43] <aruns> How to copy from clipboard and paste into Nano editor? /// I tried, (shift+insert )but its not working
[01:43] <ronnel> Oh, I've tried different LiveUSB Creators, like, Startup Disk Creator, Universal USB Installer, Rufus, UNetBootin, mkusb, even Super Grub Disk 2.
[01:44] <daftykins> ronnel: and what about 'dd' like i said? :)
[01:44] <ronnel> I may have to try it on other computers, haven't done this yet.
[01:44] <daftykins> yes that would be good

[01:45] <daftykins> right click in it.
[01:46] <ronnel> The 'dd', no not yet (I am kind of like a newbie even though I've been on linux for, maybe a year). Thanks so much daftykins!
[01:46] <OerHeks> aruns, ctrl-G for all the options
[01:47] <OerHeks> ctrl +u on most nano systems
[01:48] <aruns> I did ctrl-g and tried ctrl-u, I am exhausted with options given there, i dont know why its not working
[01:49] <ronnel> @Arun, try Shift+Ctrl+V
[01:49] <django_> Hello
[01:50] <aruns> ronnel: Yes this worked ! Thanks
[01:50] <aruns> Sometime small things become so hard even after knowing all basics.
[01:50] <daftykins> aruns: was this inside gnome-terminal?
[01:51] <aruns> daftykins :terminator
[01:51] <daftykins> so looking at the shortcuts on the edit menu would've worked perhaps
[01:52] <aruns> daftykins: I tried almost everything known to me, basic commands, forums and google ; Asking here after doing homework

[02:10] <smacktalk> does anyone know how to add a directory to the path statement?
[02:11] <smacktalk> I'm really confused by the documentation on this...one says to use .profile another .bashrc...
[02:11] <GeekMan1222> ok then; My server is setup with an rsync command that is used to copy data from my server to a local NAS drive and i need to use ssh rsa keys to run the command without using a password for the remote side. I can make the keys fine but i need help with what to do with the id_rsa.pub key after cause i try following guides online but they wont work right so i know im doing it wrong. Thanks
[02:11] <GeekMan1222> and i used to have this setup working right in the past but my domains got changed
[02:13] <aruns> EriC^^:xargs -a ~/packages sudo apt-get install --reinstall >  http://paste.ubuntu.com/12045252/
[02:14] <GeekMan1222> Also i use this scp command to copy my id_rsa.pub to my server and it works but ... it appears the keys are not working. "root@xxxx:~/.ssh# scp root@xxxx:/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ."
[02:15] <GeekMan1222>  guides i followed  http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-generating-rsa-keys/    http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Use-RSA-Key-for-SSH-Authentication-38599.shtml
[02:15] <helpmeforfree> I installed ubuntu and it still doing the freeze up
[02:16] <helpmeforfree> Is my computer not compatible with ubuntu or something?
[02:16] <daftykins> 'the freeze up' isn't quite as detailed an explanation as is useful
[02:17] <daftykins> also, i find your nickname offensive

[02:19] <magnetik_> Hi, I get no video when resuming from suspend on 14.04
[02:20] <syntroPi> how can i PREVENT gnome/ubuntu from claiming an USB STICK when inserting it? i want to use it in virtualbox but ubuntu always claims it so its not available
[02:20] <magnetik_> where should I start?
[02:20] <wileee> !pt | valmir
[02:20] <ubottu> valmir: Por favor, use #ubuntu-br para ajuda em portugues. Para entrar no canal por favor faca "/join #ubuntu-br" sem as aspas. Para a comunidade local portuguesa, use #ubuntu-pt. Obrigada.
[02:21] <artois> syntroPi: write a udev rule to have it ignored
[02:21] <artois> syntroPi: you can give it a vanity name while you're at it, if you want
[02:21] <artois> like /dev/awesomesauce
[02:21] <valmir> desculpe, estou me acostumando a este mundo.
[02:22] <eipi-1_> si-o
[02:22] <daftykins> magnetik_: try hitting ctrl+alt+F1 then ctrl+alt+F7 first
[02:22] <syntroPi> artois, hmm do i really need that? its one time only...
[02:22] <daftykins> syntroPi: so just unmount it from the host one time only?
[02:22] <magnetik_> daftykins I remember trying that and not getting any signal. I'll try again
[02:22] <magnetik_> be back later :P
[02:23] <syntroPi> daftykins, its not mounted and nautilus killed
[02:24] <syntroPi> but something from ubuntu seems to have claimed it since its not available in vbox
[02:25] <daftykins> run "mount" on its' own and check
[02:25] <daftykins> no idea how such functions in vbox work
[02:25] <wileee> syntroPi, You have it added in vbox prefrences
[02:25] <syntroPi> its not listed in "mount"
[02:25] <syntroPi> cant add it in vbox since its not avail
[02:25] <delta_> ?
[02:26] <wileee> syntroPi, YOu add when mounted, and when you start vbox it grabs it.
[02:26] <daftykins> delta_: yes? do you have a support question?
[02:26] <syntroPi> yes i know how its done in vbox but how can I add it when it wont appear in the usb filter? its claimed by ubuntu system instead somehow
[02:26] <aruns> EriC^^:There is a problem, can you guess about this : xargs -a ~/packages sudo apt-get install --reinstall >  http://paste.ubuntu.com/12045252/
[02:26] <delta_> Just a test. I'm new to irc
[02:27] <wileee> syntroPi, Once there it will go to vbox when already booted
[02:27] <wileee> as well
[02:27] <eipi-1_> does anyone use chatzilla?
[02:27] <syntroPi> wileee, its not seen by vbox since its claimed by ubuntu already
[02:27] <syntroPi> not sure which component does that
[02:27] <magnetik_> using ctrl+alt+f1 then ctrl+alt+f7 didn't work. didn't see any pseudo terminals or any video at all.
[02:28] <wileee> syntroPi, Have you just replugged it after looking it's not shown in home
[02:28] <daftykins> magnetik_: ah well.
[02:29] <syntroPi> wileee, yes maybe its because i need to be in the vboxusers group, ill try adding myself and relogin
[02:29] <wileee> yes you have to be in the group
[02:31] <GeekMan1222> hexchat
[02:33] <syntroPi> wileee, yup that was it, seems to work now ))
[02:33] <wileee> syntroPi, Good job figuring it out. ;)
[02:37] <syntroPi> can i somehow secure erase an ssd from live cd/usb stick?
[02:37] <syntroPi> i mean ubuntu 15.04 image
[02:37] <daftykins> yes with hdparm
[02:38] <daftykins> you're better off looking if the manufacturer offers some tools, however
[02:39] <syntroPi> i always do this before i reinstall ubuntu to reset the firmware, used parted magic in the past though
[02:39] <daftykins> that's overkill :)
[02:40] <syntroPi> you think the firmware will notice the new fs?
[02:40] <daftykins> no it won't have a clue, but i'm saying it's a waste of time to secure erase like that
[02:41] <syntroPi> i thought its recommended to have max perf and for "discard" option to work properly (i.e. firmware and fs in "sync")
[02:42] <daftykins> nope, someone's been telling you rubbish
[02:42] <syntroPi> so you just would reinstall it over the old system without any special commands to the ssd?
[02:43] <daftykins> correct
[02:43] <syntroPi> kk
[02:43] <daftykins> i might dd 50-100MB of zeroes to the start so it has no idea of what was once on there
[02:43] <daftykins> but no real gains to be had
[02:43] <cliffordkasper> I agree with daftykins
[02:43] <cliffordkasper> I never rewrite 1/0 over the entire disk
[02:43] <syntroPi> yeah thats how i always did it when trashing windows installations with viruses :p
[02:44] <daftykins> *malware
[02:44] <daftykins> viruses are so 90s.
[02:44] <syntroPi> yeah
[02:45] <cliffordkasper> I would think that if you are going from windows to ubuntu, even if the format/install didn't get everything (malware, virus), it would be able to target Ubuntu anyways
[02:45] <syntroPi> yeah i meant when i cleaned windows i wrote zeroes in the first houndred mb or so then reinstalled from clean dvd
[02:46] <syntroPi> anyhow on my own box there is no M$
[02:46] <syntroPi> yay my usb stick is ready to rock, cu guys l8tr
[02:47] <daftykins> every OS has its' problems, it just depends which you prefer cleaning up after.

[02:55] <kteckca> ???
[02:55] <zippo^> I have no expierence with the server, littleb00tz
[02:55] <daftykins> zippo^: because it won't get updated ever again.
[02:55] <zippo^> ah i see okee
[02:56] <zippo^> how did people make a package of the update (Bluefish) in PPA, daftykins ?
[02:56] <aruns> OerHeks, EriC^^ :There is a problem, can you guess about this : xargs -a ~/packages sudo apt-get install --reinstall >  http://paste.ubuntu.com/12045252/

[02:57] <surgy> my graphics tablet huion 580 works but not right. it needs to be mapped to a specific screen and i need to be able to change what the buttons do. which i cant. and im not even sure that the driver is installed. i am running kubuntu 14.04 lts. I am running kernal 3.19. i found wizardpen drivers but the instructions seam dated they are talking about ubuntu 10.10 there. was wandering if anyone has time to help me work on this a bit?
[02:59] <kteckca> On my server, I install ubuntu server 14.04 (LTS) so it installs fine, then the networking just does not work... I do ifconfig and it only show the loopback, i do ifconfig -a and i see eth0 and eth2 , and try to enable them, and i get a error, i cat the /etc/network/interfaces file then i see the interface that is hardwired to my network ( eth1 ) a
[02:59] <kteckca> nd the loopback, any suggestions?
[03:00] <aruns> OerHeks, EriC^^ :There is a problem, can you guess about this : xargs -a ~/packages sudo apt-get install --reinstall >  http://paste.ubuntu.com/12045252/   , Further I have explained on this thread : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2289974
[03:01] <daftykins> kteckca: show a pastebin of "ifconfig -a"
[03:04] <JanC> kteckca: if there are two devices eth0 and eth2 but your configuration only tries to use the non-existing eth1, that should explain some things I guess...
[03:05] <surgy> i guess not :(
[03:06] <daftykins> surgy: maybe post to the ask ubuntu site and/or forums since you come on at bad times for help on IRC.
[03:06] <kteckca> daftykins, i will get a pastebin, but i cant use any networking ( such as SSH ) so i will have to go back and for between the room the two computers are in
[03:07] <daftykins> kteckca: k, take a picture if it's easier.
[03:07] <surgy> daftykins, i suppose.... or maybe im not asking the question right...... is there an xinput configuration file that might have some settings i can change for the tablet?

[03:08] <daftykins> surgy: i can't help you.
[03:09] <JanC> surgy: maybe (maybe!) somebody in #ubuntu-studio or such can help
[03:10] <JanC> as artists are more likely to have a graphics tablet :)
[03:22] <kteckca> ok, daftykins here is the pastebin of ifconfig -a http://pastebin.com/usSCymys
[03:22] <stubblefield> anyone have any ideas how to get 1366 vga resolution on my monitor
[03:23] <kteckca> Settings / Display ?
[03:23] <daftykins> kteckca: so you get nothing useful from "sudo ifconfig eth0 up" ? or the same for eth2?
[03:23] <stubblefield> all the xrandr addmode stuff results in INVALID FORMAT blank monitor
[03:23] <daftykins> stubblefield: get a new cable :)
[03:23] <stubblefield> settings / display just displays UNKNOWN MONITOR
[03:23] <daftykins> a nice digital one as mentioned earlier
[03:23] <kteckca> daftykins, one sec let me double check
[03:24] <stubblefield> well i think this computer only has vga out
[03:24] <daftykins> stubblefield: the X.org log disagreed
[03:24] <stubblefield> oh really
[03:25] <stubblefield> ar eyou just saying that
[03:25] <daftykins> no i read it in the log =| what motivation would i have for lying?
[03:25] <stubblefield> just for the heck of it
[03:25] <daftykins> anyway it should be pretty obvious if you trace the VGA cable in and look if you have the white DVI socket nearby
[03:25] <daftykins> http://nvidia.custhelp.com/rnt/rnw/img/enduser/kb221_2.jpg
[03:26] <stubblefield> well my cat is sitting here, i would have to get up
[03:26] <daftykins> you should see like that
[03:26] <kteckca> daftykins , eth0 and eth1 exist on the machine, (eth2 does not) the eth0 jack is broken and has always never worked...
[03:26] <stubblefield> i don't get what nvidia is
[03:26] <daftykins> that's a link i'm sharing of a picture
[03:26] <daftykins> nvidia doesn't bear any relevance to anything right now
[03:27] <stubblefield> most of the google results about this talk about nvidia but when i run nvidia-detector it says none
[03:27] <daftykins> kteckca: ah, did you typo your pastebin then? as it reads eth2
[03:27] <kteckca> no
[03:27] <kteckca> that is what comes out, no joke
[03:27] <daftykins> kteckca: so did you trying bringing eth2 up? does it have a cable in right now?
[03:28] <kteckca> eth2 (should) not exist and if it is (what should be) eth1, yes
[03:28] <daftykins> kteckca: rather than thinking about what it should or shouldn't be - just accept what ifconfig -a reports
[03:28] <kteckca> ok... anyway
[03:28] <daftykins> so try bringing up the interface, then try getting a DHCP address over it from your router perhaps
[03:29] <daftykins> with "sudo dhclient eth2"
[03:29] <kteckca> ok brb
[03:30] <daftykins> stubblefield: yeah or you would just run "lspci" and read the model of graphics from there, likei had you do, which showed intel i965.
[03:30] <kteckca> Can't load firmware file "(Some file...)" (next line) Can't allocate memory
[03:30] <stubblefield> i appreciate that you memorized my Xorg.log
[03:32] <daftykins> nah that part was from the 'lspci'
[03:32] <stubblefield> i never ran that though
[03:32] <stubblefield> u ssh in here ?
[03:32] <daftykins> i'm about to label you an idiot and ignore you
[03:32] <daftykins> kteckca: how odd. maybe it's worth memtesting that system, doesn't sound quite happy
[03:33] <stubblefield> anyway i don't have any jack like that
[03:33] <stubblefield> i have another machine with that kind of connector
[03:33] <stubblefield> i have a thing that converts that to vga
[03:33] <stubblefield> but it flickers and sucks
[03:33] <stubblefield> i guess it should go to a usb connector into the monitor or osmething
[03:34] <surgy> whats the command to open xinput.xorg in a text editor?
[03:34] <daftykins> not USB, no.
[03:35] <stubblefield> otherwise all the monitor has is hdmi or spdif or what looks like coax
[03:35] <kteckca> hmm, I have 8 Gigs in that system, before i had webmin, ssh, dhcp, dns... running and it NEVER got above 10% (maybe 5%) now, with no services runnning, I dont think it is the ram though
[03:35] <kteckca> daftykins
[03:35] <daftykins> !webmin
[03:35] <ubottu> webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. It is not compatible with the way that Ubuntu packages handle configuration files, and is likely to cause unexpected issues with your system.
[03:35] <daftykins> ;)
[03:35] <kteckca> It is not running on my system currently
[03:35] <june> Hi everyone
[03:35] <kteckca> Hi
[03:35] <cfhowlett> surgy, gedit ...
[03:36] <daftykins> kteckca: well something isn't right, maybe google the model of NIC you have in there.
=== cbarreda is now known as _cb
[03:36] <kteckca> it is a motherboard NIC
[03:36] <kteckca> so idk
[03:36] <stubblefield> is it possible the monitor is dying ?
[03:36] <daftykins> kteckca: yeah so run "lspci" and identify it.
[03:37] <daftykins> stubblefield: doubt it.
[03:37] <stubblefield> then WTF
[03:37] <kteckca> Ispci?
[03:37] <stubblefield> it's been working for a long time
[03:37] <kteckca> ( sorry I'm relatively new to linux)
[03:37] <daftykins> for the love of Tux stubblefield - i've told you options, deal with it.
[03:38] <daftykins> kteckca: lowercase L, like list PCI
[03:38] <stubblefield> i need software options
[03:38] <cfhowlett> stubblefield, to solve a failing hardware issue?  LOL
[03:38] <daftykins> stubblefield: you're out of them.
[03:38] <cfhowlett> it don't work like tht
[03:38] <kteckca> ok...
[03:38] <stubblefield> i don't know if the hardware is failing
[03:39] <daftykins> stubblefield: go back to 12.04 then
[03:39] <stubblefield> well it worked up to like 3 days ago
[03:39] <stubblefield> that's long past 12.04
[03:39] <stubblefield> and i tried booting various old kernels in grub but no dice
[03:39] <daftykins> no it's still supported.
[03:39] <daftykins> !12.04
[03:39] <ubottu> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) is a currently-supported !LTS release of Ubuntu.  Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1204
[03:40] <daftykins> yes old kernels != 12.04
[03:40] <stubblefield> yeah i'm just saying it's been working through 2 other major ubuntu releases till now
[03:40] <daftykins> obviously you're looking for someone to throw the magic switch for you
[03:40] <daftykins> i'm done.
[03:41] <stubblefield> i've spend numerous hours on this i'm just kind of shooting in the dark now because nothing has worked
[03:41] <daftykins> ridiculous
[03:44] <kteckca> ok daftykins, downloading drivers, now I have never install linux drivers...so can you help me...
[03:44] <daftykins> you don't really download drivers in Linux land
[03:44] <daftykins> and nah, i'm off to bed shortly
[03:45] <kteckca> well..
[03:45] <kteckca> but, it is ...
[03:45] <daftykins> that's nice dear
[03:45] <kteckca> gah, well i am going to leave to my own devices

[03:55] <Finetunrda_> hey guys, my audio isn't working. What do I do?
[03:55] <Finetunrda_> It's just killed over. restarting does not resolve the issue
[03:56] <daftykins> Finetunrda_: bit odd you keep getting one issue after another, time to check the health of your hard disk and run a memtest i think.
[03:56]  * Finetunrda_ sighs
[03:57] <Finetunrda_> daftykins: can you walk me through the hdd check?
[03:57] <daftykins> sudo apt-get install pastebinit smartmontools

[03:59] <HowardTheDuck> hey how do i install ubuntu on my nexus 7
[03:59] <daftykins> !touch
[03:59] <ubottu> Information about the Ubuntu Touch platform for Phone and Tablet is available here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch . Support and discussion in #ubuntu-touch
[03:59] <daftykins> HowardTheDuck: see above
[04:00] <Finetunrda_> daftykins: while this thing installs, can you tell me how to at least restart the audio function?
[04:00] <daftykins> nope no idea.
[04:00]  * Finetunrda_ sighs
[04:00] <daftykins> you must've done something this time :)
[04:01] <Finetunrda_> daftykins: actually, I don't even know if the audio was working earlier. I just needed to be able to use wifi at that point
[04:03] <Finetunrda_> daftykins: I'm being notified that a restart is needed, should I go ahead or do you want me to run the secon command?
[04:03] <Finetunrda_> *second
[04:04] <daftykins> i can't think what the restart is in aid of, sure wasn't any of my instructions
[04:04] <daftykins> just run them now yeah, i haven't got time for the reboot.
[04:04] <Finetunrda_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/12045684/
[04:06] <daftykins> ok looks fine, maybe it's just recent kernel upgrades. you could go back like you did to check the wireless and just see if audio comes back with older kernels too.
[04:06] <daftykins> wouldn't hurt to memtest just as a precaution
[04:06] <daftykins> i gotta sleep now, nn
[04:07] <Finetunrda_> daftykins: I too must sleep. Thanks for the help. I'll do the memtest tomorrow
[04:07] <daftykins> np :)
[04:11] <surgy> guess i cant use linux
[04:11] <surgy> sucks
[04:13] <Johnny_Linux> why not surgy
[04:15] <Fudge> anyone happen to know where the ubiquity install gets the name string for the ubuntu version, i.e lsb_release etc
[04:15] <surgy> Johnny_Linux,  my kernal (3.19) supports the graphics tablet i have and there is a driver for it. and it works. but i cant seam to configure it at all..... there are things that have to be configured or it wont work right. ive been at it for a week and every trail i follow runs cold. and ive asked all the guys at the places that support y distro (kubuntu 14.04) and no one can help me they just redirect me here or there. and ive googled everythi
[04:15] <surgy> ng i know to google. the best luck ive had is the developers of the driver at digiment.gethub.io. its a huion 580 graphics tablet btw.
[04:17] <Johnny_Linux> huh, sorry, just have patients and do some more research, sorry i couldnt help, youll get it ooner or ltr
[04:17] <Johnny_Linux> i need k/b lessons too
[04:17] <surgy> ill try a few more days.... it sucks too because i love kubuntu sooo much.......... but i do digital art and i hate dual booting...
[04:18] <Johnny_Linux> which tablet
[04:18] <surgy> huion 580
[04:18] <Johnny_Linux> is that a knock off ?
[04:18] <surgy> no
[04:18] <Johnny_Linux> ok, lemme look see
[04:18] <surgy> its a cheaper chinese brand thats gaining huge support for being less feature rich but well made and less expensive
[04:19] <surgy> it is officially supported with a driver in kernal 3.19

[04:22] <surgy> yeah ive probably clicked all of those
[04:23] <Johnny_Linux> D`oh!
[04:23] <Johnny_Linux> maybe change kernels
[04:23] <surgy> will that give me a configuration tool?
[04:23] <surgy> like i said i have the driver
[04:23] <Johnny_Linux> not sure
[04:23] <SolarNRG> I can't go into 1080p mode without missing the top of the screen and the left of the screen
[04:24] <stubblefield> um, i got my resolution back
[04:25] <SolarNRG> how?
[04:25] <stubblefield> oh crap it still flickers
[04:25] <SolarNRG> my monitor and gpu both did 1080p perfect in windows why is ubuntu and debian both giving me grief?
[04:26] <stubblefield> and it says 1280x768
[04:26] <stubblefield> at least this is a start i guess
[04:26] <stubblefield> i dunno what 1080 mode is
[04:26] <stubblefield> but i am using xrandr commands
[04:26] <SolarNRG> 1920x1080
[04:27] <SolarNRG> I've got it in that resolution but the top and the left of my screen is missing
[04:27] <SolarNRG> i mean sure my mouse can go there but its off screen
[04:27] <SolarNRG> i tried messing about in xrandr
[04:27] <SolarNRG> i got the ati catalyst drivers properly installed now
[04:27] <SolarNRG> it was doing this before in debian
[04:27] <SolarNRG> but it worked fine in windows
[04:27] <SolarNRG> why?
[04:27] <SolarNRG> its outputting on the hdmi
[04:28] <Johnny_Linux> you prolly need to go with ubuntu drivers, ati outside of those really dont work well
[04:28] <SolarNRG> the outputs interestingly are labelled different in ubuntu from debian, debian calls it --output HDMI-0 but ubuntu calls is output DFP9
[04:28] <SolarNRG> Johnny_Linux, it couldn't hack the res BEFORE I installed the ati drivers
[04:28] <Johnny_Linux> ic
[04:33] <SolarNRG> shall i take this up with kernel.org?

[05:22] <julian-delphiki> syntroPi, you're more than welcome to use that PPA again.
[05:22] <julian-delphiki> and gedit is onlike 3.17 now or something.

[05:26] <mike1960> hello
[05:26] <gott3rfunk3n83> Hi
[05:29] <Michaelrockingth> tell me why the hell does the dang ubuntu live cd freeze up.. I happened at 1:04am i waited until 1:10am to turn the computer off and it did nothing
[05:29] <Michaelrockingth> Is it my computer tell me!!
[05:30] <gott3rfunk3n83> Its ur computer
[05:30] <mike1960> it can be either a bad disk or need to clean the drive
[05:31] <Michaelrockingth> mike1960 clean the drive?
[05:31] <mike1960> yes a dvd cleaner disk
[05:31] <Michaelrockingth> but how is it my computer gott3rfunk3n83
[05:31] <Michaelrockingth> Mike1960 I'm using sandisk usb
[05:31] <gott3rfunk3n83> Problem with your drive
[05:31] <cfhowlett> !md5sum | Michaelrockingth verify 1. your .iso  and 2. the usb
[05:31] <ubottu> Michaelrockingth verify 1. your .iso  and 2. the usb: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[05:32] <mike1960> ok... contacts in your USB
[05:32] <gott3rfunk3n83> Probably the way its partitioned wrong
[05:32] <Michaelrockingth> Well i don't see how it is the contacts in the USB i just bought this one like 3 days ago.
[05:33] <mike1960> ok then verify your iso
[05:33] <cfhowlett> Michaelrockingth, mike.  you don't mind if I call you Mike? Good.  Ever heard GIGO?  Garbage in, garbage out?  VERIFY ^^^
[05:33] <Michaelrockingth> cfhowlett if the md5 is right what else could it be
[05:34] <cfhowlett> Michaelrockingth, it COULD be : VERIFY.  I don't do "what if".  Get the facts first and we'll talk.
[05:34] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, on which step does it freeze?
[05:35] <Michaelrockingth> all i had on the live disc installed was firefox, flash player and trying to download updates and thats when the whole system froze up.
[05:35] <gott3rfunk3n83> I had similar prob. Fixed
[05:35] <Michaelrockingth> I was on 2 flash based webistes as well.
[05:36] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, hmm maybe ram was full if you do that on livecd/usb?
[05:36] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, do you want to install it?
[05:36] <Michaelrockingth> I checked it and it was only using 1.5GiB of 3.7GiB before it all happened.
[05:36] <mike1960> should have installed to HDD and free up RAM
[05:36] <aruns> OerHeks, EriC^^ :There is a problem, can you guess about this : xargs -a ~/packages sudo apt-get install --reinstall >  http://paste.ubuntu.com/12045252/   , Further I have explained on this thread : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2289974
[05:37] <Michaelrockingth> Yes i want to install Ubuntu but not if its gonna do that.
[05:37] <gott3rfunk3n83> Try install without going to advanced partitioning just straight install to drive choose the drive then click install
[05:37] <cfhowlett> Michaelrockingth, do you also have windows?
[05:37] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, hmm well you would have to find out where the problem originates
[05:37] <Michaelrockingth> I have windows 8.1 64-bit fully updated
[05:38] <cfhowlett> Michaelrockingth, install virtualbox to windows.  install lubuntu to vbox.
[05:38] <Michaelrockingth> If i re do the flash drive and give it persitant cache this time would it leave info in syslog
[05:39] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, its sluggishly slow (at least last time i tried that)
[05:39] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, if you have an android you could try to ssh into the live session to look into the logs or dmesg
[05:39] <gott3rfunk3n83> Did you burn the iso to cd? Or just on the usb.
[05:39] <gott3rfunk3n83> What tool you used?
[05:40] <Michaelrockingth> just usb and i used the tool mentioned here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows
[05:40] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, also afaik if you press F2 on bootup there was an option to verify the files on the usb drive
[05:40] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, i mean after you entered the boot menu of the ubuntu usb stick
[05:41] <syntroPi> not sure if its still there though
[05:41] <Michaelrockingth> syntropi when i install to the hdd and say its does the same thing could y'all help even better after that
[05:41] <cfhowlett> syntroPi, true but that doesn't hashcheck.  that's why REPEATEDLY has been suggested md5sum.  guess that's just too much trouble to do though
[05:41] <Michaelrockingth> cause i mean right now it don't seem like much help right now
[05:42] <Michaelrockingth> cfhowlett well dang I'm about to do it now..
[05:42] <Michaelrockingth> I had to redownload the iso becaue i removed it from my laptop after i burned it to the usb
[05:42] <abb0> anyone in here have a walkthru link for help installing nzbget on ubuntu? by chance
[05:42] <gott3rfunk3n83> Hashcheck if your iso was completely downloaded
[05:42] <gott3rfunk3n83> Then come back
[05:42] <abb0> ima newcomer to linux mostly tho
[05:43] <Michaelrockingth> Well i'll brb
[05:43] <syntroPi> cfhowlett, i thought that option in the boot menu would read file hashes from checksums.md5 and verify the livecd files hashes
=== regedit_ is now known as regedit
[05:44] <minimec> abb0: http://www.htpcguides.com/install-nzbget-stable-ubuntu-ppa/
[05:44] <cfhowlett> syntroPi, it doesn't.
[05:44] <syntroPi> hmm
[05:45] <cfhowlett> syntroPi, I thought the same for years as well but confirmed that it's not the case.
[05:45] <rainbowwarrior> hi, i just installed ubuntu 15.04 along side windows 10 on an msi ge60 2qd apache , my problem is i am not getting a choice of what o/s to choose from and its going straight to windows 10, how can i fix this please ?
[05:45] <syntroPi> cfhowlett, what does this option do then instead? im always curious to learn new...
[05:46] <gott3rfunk3n83> Grub
=== Yukkii is now known as Kaneki
[05:47] <mike1960> i was just thinking the same thing Gott
[05:47] <gott3rfunk3n83> On the installer there should be an option to install alongside windows
[05:48] <mike1960> im on the latest grub.. and yes the option exists
[05:48] <gott3rfunk3n83> On the installer there is an option to install alongside windows. Be sure its ticked
[05:49] <rainbowwarrior> gott3rfunk3n83 , I installed Ubuntu 15.04 along side windows 10 but its going straight into windows 10 and not letting me choose between ubuntu 15.04 and windows 10.
[05:50] <syntroPi> is there any known solution to get a full gnome 3.14 for ubuntu 15.04?
[05:50] <cfhowlett> syntroPi, install ubuntu-gnome ??
[05:51] <minimec> rainbowwarrior: Did you install both systems on the same harddrive, or seperate harddrives? Because during installation, Ubuntu should replace the boot sector and give you the choice to select the os. Now if you use two harddrives, it might be that you are simply booting the 'wrong' drive first. So change the boot order.
[05:51] <mike1960> hmm gnome desktop through synaptic file manager
[05:51] <syntroPi> cfhowlett, thats what i meant
[05:51] <rainbowwarrior> im sure my bios does not need to be in legacy to run ubuntu 15.04 as im sure if i remember right ubuntu supports ueifi now
[05:51] <rainbowwarrior> minimec its on same hard drive
[05:51] <syntroPi> so correction:  is there any known solution to get a full gnome 3.14 desktop (with all apps) for ubuntu-gnome 15.04 x64?
[05:52] <minimec> rainbowwarrior: So I wonder that the boot sector was not replaced during install...

=== zorbs is now known as zorbsOne
[05:54] <cfhowlett> syntroPi, got it I think.  md5sum verifies the .iso downloaded matches the .iso build.  in other words checks against the main source.  verify cd integrity ONLY checks against the downloaded .iso.  if that .iso is funky ...
[05:57] <Michaelrockingth> cfhowlett ok I have it open in the md5 checker what do i click now the calculate or compare?
[05:58] <Michaelrockingth> The iso i just downloaded i get the error they are different..
[05:58] <ufk> hello
[05:58] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, you should check against the published md5sums on http://releases.ubuntu.com/
[05:58] <Michaelrockingth> ok
[05:58] <ufk> i installed mariadb-server but i can't get it to start. i can't see any error messages. any ideas ?
[05:59] <Michaelrockingth> It says they are the same
[06:01] <Michaelrockingth> redoing the usb now syntroPi
[06:01] <syntroPi> cfhowlett, im struggling to understand what you meant with your explanation on the verify option: i understand it depends on a non-corrupt checksums.md5 file inside the iso
[06:01] <Michaelrockingth> should i just boot into it and now install or play around in it and see if it freezes up
[06:01] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, what graphics card do you have?
[06:02] <Michaelrockingth> syntroPi let me generate a system report with speccy it only take a second :)
[06:02] <Michaelrockingth> syntroPi http://speccy.piriform.com/results/NHO4cbdwoOt3WF2uLf1pGMY
[06:03] <Hanumaan> I have laptop where I installed windows and Ubuntu but only windows is getting booted I could go to ubuntu only when I press F9 and then select in grub also grub has windows but there is something wrong unable to see grub directly..
[06:04] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, well it seems to be some sort of intel graphics (which is good since it probably can use some open source drivers)
[06:04] <Michaelrockingth> syntroPi the intel website says my graphics card isn't  supporting linux and on the live preview of ubuntu it said i had sandy bridge graphics
[06:04] <akik> syntroPi: there's a checksums.md5 file inside the iso?
[06:05] <Michaelrockingth> syntroPi should i just install to HDD and then see what happens or wait and play around on the fresh copy of usb?
[06:05] <akik> syntroPi: i usually compare the md5/sha256 checksum to the published checksums found on ubuntu website
[06:06] <Michaelrockingth> what would you recommend :)
[06:06] <syntroPi> akik, yes /md5sum.txt with some content like http://pastie.org/10340945
[06:06] <akik> syntroPi: ok that file doesn't include the checksum for the whole iso
[06:07]  * Michaelrockingth pokes syntroPi
[06:07] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, hmm thats your decision, I would always prefer some linux over any windows but thats my opinion. if you want to find out more about your problem you could try on live without doing any harm
[06:08] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, do you have another pc avail in your network?
[06:08] <Michaelrockingth> syntroPi how would i find the issue cause though would it be logged this time around since i gave the usb 4GB of presistent cache
[06:08] <Michaelrockingth> no
[06:08] <syntroPi> or tablet or phone?
[06:08] <syntroPi> (android)
[06:08] <Michaelrockingth> I have an Android asus MeMO pad 7 (ME176cx)
[06:09] <Michaelrockingth> why?
[06:09] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, you can try to enable ssh server on the live cd and then use ConnectBot to ssh into the live session
[06:10] <Michaelrockingth> ok
[06:10] <syntroPi> if its not frozen really nasty you still should be able to read the logs, restart services (eg. lightdm) and such
[06:10] <Michaelrockingth> syntropi would it save info to syslog this time around?
[06:10] <syntroPi> Michaelrockingth, i dont know how that persistent storage on liveusb works i never really used that
[06:11] <Michaelrockingth> i guess its worth a see :P

[06:15] <rainbowwarrior> squinty , there is no boot repair and also holding left shift down while booting does nothing, i did notice in my bios i have euifi , eufie and csm and legacy , but im sure it should not matter what one of those i choose ?
[06:15] <rainbowwarrior> sorry about typos
[06:18] <syntroPi> akik, ofc it wont verify itself or the whole iso but the files contents
[06:18] <eipi-1_> I typed this:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:videolan/stable-daily and after update, I got:   E: Type 'ain' is not known on line 2 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/videolan-stable-daily-precise.list

[07:34] <aruns> cfhowlett, Ben64 : i tried pinging 182.79.218.37 manually and it requires permission. I think i am going nut, I dont noticed it due to fatigue to deal with this problem for very long time

[07:36] <wileee> used to be a hack, nothing out there
[07:37] <wileee> was not a joke, but the reality of the desktop ;)
[07:39] <cfhowlett> aruns, I've read all your pastes.  this http://paste.ubuntu.com/12045252/ lines 6 - 15 are clearly in error.  I'd suggest you stop and take a nap.  then reinstall a clean ubuntu.  something is clearly very well scrambled which renders your system untrustworthy.  IMHO.
[07:39] <wileee> easyOnMe, Probably would be popular if there was a easy way, I suspect.
[07:40] <aruns> cfhowlett: Can i fix this system, Is it beyond repair?
[07:41] <cfhowlett> aruns, fix = reinstall from a clean, verified .iso
[07:42] <aruns> cfhowlett : I know thats the last option, what I am trying is to learn how to fix this system, Is it impossible? or information in our hand is not sufficient to address this problem.
[07:43] <aruns> cfhowlett : Fresh install is the quick way to get out of problem but what remains buried is unsolved problem.

[07:45] <wileee> this is free volunteer help, we are not obligated to help
[07:46] <cfhowlett> aruns as I understand it, you deleted several pieces of ubuntu-core while chasing the shiny python version.  that alone is enough to destabilize your system.  then the reinstall of ubunut-desktop failed with some very questionable errors pointing towards ? sources? install script?                Short answer: Ive NO idea what your system is doing, haven't seen this particular mix of fail before, thus my (sanity saving) suggestion to clean reinstall.  B
[07:46] <cfhowlett> UT ... YMMV
[07:46] <aruns> wileee : what yo intend to say from that statement? Any offence done by me

[07:56] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, krita, gimp, pencil, mypaint, >>> synfig studio <<<
[07:56] <cfhowlett> synfig specifically for 2d anim
[07:58] <Sebsebsebb> Saying that there's another driver as well that it says isn't working and can't just enable

[07:58] <cfhowlett> all free!

[08:01] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, tried krita, more familiar with gimp and actually developed a tiny bit of skill with inkscape.  My snowman rocks!
[08:01] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: lol but is it also possible to animate thinks created in inkscape usng inkscape
[08:02] <easyOnMe> I have used inkscape and gimp very often
[08:02] <easyOnMe> for web design projects

[08:36] <zzarr> Nakul, can you pastebin your /etc/fstab?
[08:37] <popey> Nakul: i would be inclined to "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" and see if it installs anything that was missing. (I suspect it will)
[08:37] <khangeek> @Ben64 zenoss is a server monitoing tool based on snmp protocl
[08:37] <popey> Nakul: eek, mistake, should be "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^" <- note tha ^

[08:38] <Ben64> khangeek: you missed the second half of the question
[08:39] <syntroPi> !pastebinit | Nakul
[08:39] <ubottu> Nakul: pastebinit is the command-line equivalent of !pastebin - Command output, or other text can be redirected to pastebinit, which then reports an URL containing the output - To use pastebinit, install the <unconvertable> pastebinit <unconvertable> package from a package manager - Simple usage: command | pastebinit -b http://paste.ubuntu.com
