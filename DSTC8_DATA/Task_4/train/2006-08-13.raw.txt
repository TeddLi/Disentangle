=== ubuntu is now known as Shinzetsu
[08:07] <stopher> it does, cuz i can't get non-iso-burned disks to run, i have to go to BURN ISO and locate the .iso file and burn it
[08:07] <godtvisken> How can I make my own keymap?
[08:08] <davidjohnston> thanks man and thanks to you all...i'll give it another run tomorrow, i've only been at it about 1.5 hours tonight anyway just thought I would see if I could get any good ideas and you all have been very helpful
[08:08] <sethk> stopher, a cd neither runs nor doesn't run.
[08:08] <Shinzetsu> gdb: also when I try and remove/install anything it gives me an error that it cant delete 'scim-gtk2-something'  and tells me to dpkg --configure -a, but it wont go away
[08:08] <stopher> sethk i think you are the one confuzed
[08:08] <stopher> google and download.com search for ISO BURNER you will find with some drives (most) you need to BURN IT AS BOOTABLE ISO  not just copy it

[08:09] <gdb> Shinzetsu: Er, what, exactly, did you do?
[08:09] <Pntkl> Hello
[08:09] <Shinzetsu> gdb: remove xubuntu-desktop, and it removed kubuntu with it aswell
[08:09] <gdb> Shinzetsu: The commands on the "Pure GNOME" page simply remove the KDE packages in one step, and the XFCE packages in another.
[08:09] <Shinzetsu> gdb: I know
[08:09] <Shinzetsu> gdb: well anyway I cant install anything because of that ^ in recovery mode
[08:10] <gdb> Shinzetsu: xubuntu-desktop is a package which depends on others, but on which nothing depends.
[08:10] <gdb> hrm
[08:10] <gdb> Shinzetsu: What was the command you used?
[08:10] <Pntkl> I'll think about it
[08:10] <Shinzetsu> gdb: sudo apt-get remove <heckload of all the xubuntu packages>
[08:10] <sethk> stopher, an ISO format cd may be bootable, or may not be bootable.  One burns an iso file system to a CD in either case.

[08:11] <sethk> stopher, the structure of the ISO impacts whether it is bootable, but not whether it can be burned.

[08:11] <sethk> stopher, if you mean that you use a program to burn an iso image to a cd, that's true, but so what?
[08:11] <Shinzetsu> gdb: I should be able to access my harddrive if I add it in fstab
[08:11] <acab_> could i ask something about xinerama?
[08:11] <gdb> Shinzetsu: And what package is it complaining about now?

[08:13] <DamianFinol> I already have dual head setup, in fact, Xchat is runnin in the second monitor. I just want to extend the task barto cover both monitors.
[08:13] <acab_> have you never tried xinerama?
[08:13] <cowmilk> what command do i do to find out what 2 days and 9 hours from now is?
[08:13] <PORDO> how can one make two monitors get treated like one wide monitor, so that maximizing a window, for instance, causes it to span both monitors?
[08:13] <stopher> i was SAYING THAT!! it will BURN but not BOOT... ENGLISH!!! ITS CALLED ENGLISH!!
[08:13] <DamianFinol> Good evening, I have a question, I'm running a dual head setup and Gnome as Desktop Environment. I would like for the application taskbar to extend the second monitor. Any ideas? I can create a new panel and move it to the other monitor, but only to put quick launch applications in there.
[08:13] <Shinzetsu> gdb: Nope, I have none

[08:16] <sethk> Shinzetsu, I didn't here the whole conversation, what did you need about that package?

[08:16] <DamianFinol> Good evening, I have a question, I'm running a dual head setup and Gnome as Desktop Environment. I would like for the application taskbar to extend the second monitor.

[08:16] <zoidberg> can anyone help me?

[08:17] <NickGarvey> zoidberg: pcmcia is a special slot used in laptops, not an issue if you have a desktop
[08:17] <Shinzetsu> sethk: error removing
[08:17] <gdb> Shinzetsu: Then you may want to boot to single user mode and run "dpkg-reconfigure gdm" and tell the system you want to use gdm over kdm.  We know that kdm is broken, but perhaps gdm is working.  I don't know if dpkg will allow you to do that with a broken package system, but it's something to try to get your display working.  Once you're back in gnome, we can troubleshoot further.
[08:17] <noiesmo> darth_gimp, thats fine same kernel source code
[08:17] <sethk> Shinzetsu, you'll have to use some of the force-xxxx flags with dpkg do get yourself going again.
[08:17] <gdb> Unless sethk has some ideas that are more helpful.
[08:17] <darth_gimp> noiesmo, thanks...
[08:17] <Shinzetsu> gdb: dont you mean dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?

[08:41] <Shinzetsu> gdb: how do I leave Irssi?

[08:41] <Flannel> Shinzetsu: /quit
[08:41] <jamie> DamianFinol: and what is that? Im kinda new here.

[08:41] <NickGarvey> IRCMonkeyX: but.. "ps ax | grep amsn" would show you the pid

[08:53] <Shinzetsu> gdb: i was removing xubuntu-desktop inside kde, and it somehow managed to delete both xfce and kde
[08:53] <NickGarvey> darth_gimp: (thats actually a symlink to it)
[08:53] <Flannel> Talisker: your sudo password is your user password
[08:53] <Talisker> oh rly\?
[08:53] <darth_gimp> NickGarvey, its not there...
[08:53] <Shinzetsu> Tailsker: ya rly
[08:53] <NickGarvey> darth_gimp: then apt-get install linux-source
[08:53] <Talisker> Heh, I never noticed that since they are the same on my machine
[08:53] <scai> hi.. Im having a trouble with firefox.. ti crashes in some sites.. some one can help me?
[08:53] <gdb> Shinzetsu: Hrm, odd, I can only surmise that you cut and pasted, perhaps, both commands rather then one at a time.
[08:53] <Shinzetsu> gdb: try and apt-get install gdm ubuntu-desktop?
[08:53] <Talisker> You've been much help, thanks
[08:53] <Flannel> Talisker: why on earth do you have a root account then?
[08:54] <gdb> Shinzetsu: At anyrate, right now you want to "apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
[08:54] <Shinzetsu> gdb: okay hang on

[08:54] <darth_gimp> NickGarvey, ok I did that and got linux-source-2.6.15.tar.bz2
[08:54] <Talisker> Flannel, what do you mean, you can't not have a root account
[08:54] <jamie> DamianFinol: hum.. its says the folder im trying to mount to is occupied or that the disk is allraedy mounted
[08:54] <NickGarvey> darth_gimp: it should.. extract and do all that stuff for you..
[08:54] <Talisker> Anyway, you've been much help, thanks
[08:54] <DamianFinol> did you check the folder?
[08:54] <Flannel> Talisker: yes you can.  Ubuntu doesn't have a root account.  Or, it's disabled, and designed to stay that way.
=== SonicvanaJr [n=sonic@unaffiliated/sonicvanajr]  has joined #ubuntu
[08:54] <Talisker> Flannel, the latter is acceptable
[08:54] <stopher> Ubuntu protects itself that way
[08:55] <Talisker> But sometimes I need root access
[08:55] <NickGarvey> Talisker: sudo -i
[08:55] <stopher> use the sudo command
[08:55] <gdb> Talisker: You can get a root shell with "sudo -i" for an "su -" login and "sudo -s" for an "su" style login.

[08:56] <Double_D> anyone: i'm trying to get apache2 to parse php scripts after being processed, but it only allows them to be saved.  if the code is embedded in an html file, it works.  any ideas?
[08:56] <DamianFinol> Talisker, use 'sudo passwd root' and set a root password
[08:56] <Flannel> Talisker: You set a root password, that means you have a root account ;)  unless you've since disabled it
[08:56] <Talisker> I never realised it was because they are the same on my machine
[08:56] <DamianFinol> Talisker,  There, you got a root accoun tnow
[08:56] <Talisker> Well, g2g, thanks
[08:56] <gdb> It's sudo asking if you're really Talisker before letting you run things as root.
[08:56] <NickGarvey> Talisker: but its not a good idea to do sudo passwd root
[08:56] <gdb> :-)
[08:56] <stopher> can you add files to apache without being at the server? do it thru a network?
[08:56] <NickGarvey> stopher: yeah.. ftp it up then use ssh to move it..
[08:57] <DamianFinol> stopher, ftp or ssh?
[08:57] <gdb> stopher: scp / ftp / etc them to /var/www or $HOME/public_html, yes.
[08:57] <jamie> DamianFinol: I made the foledr in my hoem dir.
[08:57] <NickGarvey> stopher: or you could set up nfs to mount your apache dir (is what I do)
[08:57] <gdb> stopher: You can also use an SMB mount and use the Windows file manager to access your pages without logging into the server itself.

[08:59] <stopher> what is FTP passwd?
[08:59] <NickGarvey> darth_gimp: eek
[08:59] <gdb> stopher: Ah, well, doing that is going to be problematic.  You may want to make those files owned by your normal user account.  Then you'll want to use System -> Administration -> Shared Folders to share /var/www.  Then you will need to run "smbpasswd -a username" to add yourself to the smbpasswd file.  After you're done, you can mount the folder as a disk with Windows using \\server\name_used_in_the_control_panel
[08:59] <NickGarvey> darth_gimp: 2 things
[08:59] <DamianFinol> jamesrk, Edit your fstab like this:  /dev/sda1       /windows/       ntfs umask=1000 0       0
[08:59] <jamie> DamianFinol: ok..a nd how do i do/get/see that? :P sorry for all my stupid question..^
[08:59] <DamianFinol> err jamie
[08:59] <NickGarvey> darth_gimp: 1. If you did what I said, it should be in /usr/src/linux now
[08:59] <gdb> stopher: Like "net use w: \\my.server.com\web"

[08:59] <DamianFinol> replace /dev/xxx and /windows/ with your information, now you need to setup the umask correctly too

[09:01] <gdb> Shinzetsu: Ah, great!  Now you can boot into the desktop but /quit in irssi to exit it, and "exit" at the root prompt.  Once you're bck in here, we can work on making sure that KDE and XFCE are completely gone.
[09:01] <corevette> _lemsx1_ what?
[09:01] <gdb> Shinzetsu: sure thing!
[09:01] <DamianFinol> corevette, Easily? boot windows recovery, and type: fixmbr then resize or delete the linux partitions

[09:11] <Bonez56_> Shinzetsu: there is no easy way to remove kubuntu-desktop as it's a virtual package. you need to open synaptic and search for "kde" and remove everything except the kde libs
[09:11] <DarkElf109> Flannel: That's the crazy thing: There is no file, and there's no mention of it anywhere in my Maildir. It's a phantom folder!
[09:11] <gdb> Shinzetsu: sweet!  Now, do you want to make sure all of KDE and XFCE are removed or are you good to go for now?
[09:11] <NickGarvey> stopher: I would just use nfs and mount it on your local system
[09:11] <DarkElf109> DamianFinol: Well, because we're still using a monolithic kernel, if a device driver goes crazy, it could require a reboot
[09:11] <Flannel> DarkElf109: wouldn't it be in .trash? sorry, Im not familiar with Courier, or, is it hidden? ls -a?
[09:12] <Bonez56_> BeepAU: how did you go?

[09:15] <DarkElf109> So...now that that's all cleared up (been bugging me for a week -_-), anybody need help?
[09:15] <gdb> Shinzetsu: they would be included with kubuntu-desktop
[09:16] <NickGarvey> darth_gimp: not sure, and its like 3:15 here so I need to finish my work and go to sleep, good luck
[09:16] <gdb> Shinzetsu: If you want them back, then you can apt-get install kubuntu-desktop ;-)
[09:16] <stopher> It's just not working for me
[09:16] <Bonez56_> gdb: sounds very similar to be, except instead of the netbsd I went to debian... stayed there since, but now i'm learning RHCE, it's a bit of a nightmare after doing debian for so long :)
[09:16] <darth_gimp> NickGarvey, yep thanks

[09:56] <redblades> Hi, how do I install ubuntu with the X installer?
[09:57] <redblades> As in, just use it normally, not a live CD
[09:57] <DarkElf109> jeeaar: No, but it makes more sense. If it creates any extra files, it usually drops them in the working directory if the location isn't explicitly set
[09:57] <redblades> The box I'm planning to use it fairly slowish

[09:58] <DarkElf109> Gah...can't type this fast...
[09:58] <redblades> DarkElf109, I want to use the non-X installer.
[09:58] <DarkElf109> redblades: Ah. Then you'll need the alternate install CD
[09:58] <Jamie> hum.. anyoen running VLC media player on linux?
[09:58] <ireneshusband> would replacing the ubuntu kernel with a more vanilla one reduce the pcmcia-related dark energy, or would that just leave me with bigger problems?
[09:58] <DarkElf109> Jamie: I am =)
[09:58] <Jamie> DarkElf: how do i get it and install apt cant find it
[09:58] <DarkElf109> ireneshusband: It may or may not remove the pcmcia problem...it also may or may not introduce new problems

[10:02] <jeeaar> :(
[10:02] <due> I'm having issues with shutting my new install of Dapper down; it's a laptop, Dell, apparently it was an issue with the ipw2200 (found some posts about it from a few years ago), but even modprobe -r before shutdown still makes it hang on "Mounting the root filesystem read only".
[10:02] <jeeaar> i think i have the server running, i just dont think ive defined a connection point.
[10:02] <DarkElf109> minerale: man eject

[10:03] <ireneshusband> when  i try booting with the card inserted I get a raft of kernel error messages and a failed boot, way before x starts. I'll have to try crashing the puter again to get a summary unfortunately.
