[03:46] <barata> it is There
[03:46] <Sanctusorium> ah
[03:46] <Sanctusorium> Never mind
[03:46] <cablesm102> shmeelAway, why both vmplayer and qemu?

[03:47] <bruenig> barata, you must format at least one partition and call that root. If you don't want to do that, then don't install it.

[04:39] <ferret_0567__> How do I activate AIGLX in Ubuntu 6.10?
[04:39] <xtknight> !aiglx | ferret_0567__
[04:39] <ubotu> ferret_0567__: AIGLX (Accelerated Indirect GLX) is an open source project founded by the X.Org Foundation and the Fedora Core Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering capabilities to X.org and DRI drivers. This allows remote X clients to get fully hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol. Head to #ubuntu-xgl for support.
[04:40] <xtknight> are you sure you want AIGLX?
[04:40] <worldedit> xtknight, 64 bit firefox, i think, not ultra sure but 64 sounds familiar.
[04:40] <ferret_0567__> Any problems specific to Ubuntu?
[04:40] <xtknight> ferret_0567__: for nvidia you should just use the builtin nvidia compositor, im not sure about ati

[05:16] <xtknight> worldedit: we put an & at the end so it didn't hang up the terminal.  normally when you execute stuff it's synchronous, that means it freezes the terminal until that command completes.  gedit does not complete until you close it, so your terminal will be frozen while you're reading the readme.  you dont want that, so you append the "&" operator to make the terminal usable and so the terminal doesnt wait for gedit to close until yo
[05:16] <xtknight> u can type again

[05:24] <elishae> btw,  is it possible to first install ubuntu and then install windows and still get ubuntu to work ?
[05:24] <xtknight> kuma: i always stick with repository versions.  latest version of the app isnt uploaded for a while (to the mainstream) because of stability concerns
[05:24] <xtknight> elishae: yes, just rewrite grub to the mbr
[05:24] <juano__> elishae: yes, though windows overrides mbr
[05:24] <guzza> Q: i'm having a problem with amarok under gnome ... the error is : "DCOP communications error"
[05:24] <kuma> xtknight: I see, for example firefox 2?
=== so-so [i=ytyuty@221.209.97.142]  has left #ubuntu []
[05:24] <juano__> elishae: sure, you have to install grub again to mbr as xtknightsais
[05:25] <shatrat> kuma, for some apps you can get 3rd party repos that are updated more often, for example Beryl-SVN or the budgetdedicated wine repo

[05:27] <shatrat> FILETBRIGADE, so I take it you are using DHCP?
[05:27] <elishae> If I'm right, the steps are : (1) boot with live CD , (2) open terminal and mount existing root partition /mnt/ubuntu , (3) chroot to /mnt/ubuntu , (4) grub install
[05:28] <FILETBRIGADE> shatrat: that's what my guess is.

[05:28] <shatrat> FILETBRIGADE, could you tell me if you have an IP address for your interface when you type "ifconfig"?

[05:29] <FILETBRIGADE> Something along those lines.

[05:43] <Naurd> So, when do you not have sound?
[05:44] <barata> once you already put it in a partition of your choice, go as usual, chroot
[05:44] <gbv22> hi guys, ..quick qn, i have a machine that is running windows XP and I would like to try ubuntu out. i have already burnt a CD with the image. How should I go about doing this so that my windows installation is not affected...?
[05:44] <barata> I'll write a manual soon
[05:44] <kitche> barata: it's just easier to use the alternate cd
[05:44] <genii> bef Thats not really a question for this channel
[05:44] <Naik0> Naurd: when i play a dvd file
[05:44] <barata> you mean to download it again? crap
[05:44] <shatrat> gbv22, you can run the liveCD without making any changes, if you do decide to install, defrag your NTFS drive first and then you can pretty easily shrink it and put ubuntu in the free space

[05:44] <Naurd> ahh, ok maybe you don't have all the codecs installed...

[05:45] <bef> genii: i'm aware of that, yet there are lots of ubuntu users here and i'm looking for graphics help for an ubuntu project ;)
[05:45] <shortn> xtknight: yes :P
[05:45] <shatrat> kitche, barata is trolling.  He was in here earlier moaning about how ubuntu was a newbie windows wannabe OS because it requires you to format at least one partition
[05:45] <Naurd> Naiko : Do you see the image of the movie?
[05:45] <Naik0> yes
[05:45] <Naik0> but i cant click on it
[05:45] <barata> install it in vmware, minimal install is preferred, copy that to a real HD, copy that again ... then fix your menu.lst

[05:46] <shatrat> gbv22, thats pretty easy to do as well.  Run the liveCD and see how you like it.  There is a walk through on debianadmin,org, or .com, or whatever, for the whole install
[05:46] <olmari> wastrel: I can't think anything more myself either... I have tried everything I know todo... and I'd say alot compared being 4th day linux user :D

[05:47] <genii> bef Well, it's more of a question not having to do with some kind of support help like hardware or software issues
[05:47] <Naurd> ok, it is like kind of a iso image of a DVD?
[05:47] <xxyyzz> barata, thanks that's exactly what I was looking for :)
[05:47] <Naik0> yupps
[05:47] <xxyyzz> Thank you too kitche =)
[05:47] <xxyyzz> You guys are great =)
[05:48] <shortn> xtknight: alright, i typed that in, the cursor is just flashing there
[05:48] <Naik0> Naurd: what codecs do i need
[05:48] <shatrat> gbv22, Well, it should put an entry for windows in your Grub boot manager, if it doesnt you can add one later,  if you really have problems with Grub you can easily reinstall the windows MBR from the windows install disk or a boot floppy or whatever.
[05:48] <Naik0> for playing dvd?
[05:48] <cablesm102> Does anyone know if wireless on powerbooks works on Ubuntu? I'm helping someone who can't type over Skype.

[05:48] <Naurd> ok, that's why is it now working with Totem/Xine...  Did not know that mplayer was able to do this ...

[05:50] <shortn> xtknight: no big deal, thanks for your help so far
[05:50] <bef> kitche: how so?
[05:51] <Naurd> for packages, I use Totem and installed everything that is called gstream**** (except for dev packages)...  As for mplayer, you can use Automatix (search google) and it will install a bunch of codecs used by mplayer and Xine...
[05:51] <shatrat> gbv22, Indeed.  Do you want to use the whole second drive for linux? that makes it even easier

[05:52] <Pirate-king> what was the
[05:53] <Naurd> I think that mplayer may have problem playing ac3 files...  but I'm not sure... That would explain why you don't have audio with mpalyer.
[05:53] <Pirate-king> gnome network what was it?

[05:53] <shatrat> gbv22, I believe at the partitioning part of the install you can choose the second drive from a drop down menu or something and choose to format and use the whole thing.  If you really want to try out other flavors of linux later you might want to partition it into extra chunks now
[05:53] <Naurd> Can you open your img file to copy one of the VOB files on your hd?

[05:55] <juano__> genii: absolutely
[05:55] <Pirate-king> hey shatrat the gnome network tool you told me to install?
[05:56] <shatrat> gbv22, well, you could make about a 10-15 gig partition for the root, /, and then make a larger one and mount /home to it in the mounting stage.  That way when you reinstall you dont have to format your personal files.  Youll also want a swap.
