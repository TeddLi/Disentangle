[23:26] <Timkanpy> I've only used Windows until now (yes, I know, it is bad u_u)
[23:26] <OerHeks> Timkanpy, install xubuntu-restricted-extras, this will install flash, java and more webtools and codecs and such
[23:27] <mattwj2002> is 13.10 out yet?
[23:27] <Timkanpy> Oh, nice ! Where can I find it ?
[23:27] <swaagie> I keep getting i386 recommandations and held broken packages making apt-get essentially broken

[23:29] <k1l_> mattwj2002: good question.
[23:29] <mattwj2002> that was just a rhetorical question

[23:30] <swaagie> I wanted to resort to wine to get that piece of crap skype working, however I get wine depends on wine1.6 or wine1.7 now :/ any suggestions on how to fix that
[23:30] <mattwj2002> swaggie skype has a native app
[23:30] <Timkanpy> No idea, I think it is the thing called "logithèque"
[23:30] <wilee-nilee> Timkanpy, They are both the ubuntu base, with different desktops, and different and shared apps.
[23:31] <Timkanpy> Ok ty wilee-nilee
[23:31] <swaagie> mattwj2002: afaik they dont for 64bit
[23:32] <mattwj2002> swaggie yes they do

[23:33] <swaagie> yeah it should
[23:33] <swaagie> like it did normally on my other workstation
[23:33] <swaagie> hopeless rabbit hole on laptop, for some reason it keeps refusing to install certain i386 deps
[23:34] <mattwj2002> weird
[23:34] <mattwj2002> what version of ubuntu are you running?
[23:34] <swaagie> yeah and it seems im now left with a pretty broken pacakge manager not even capable of installing  anything ese within resorted and asking for 32bit packages
[23:34] <swaagie> 13.04
[23:34] <wilee-nilee> swaagie, what release are you running

[23:43] <wilee-nilee> swaagie, Please post every command with the lists, I never use wine I just use windows apps in windows.
[23:44] <swaagie> wilee-nilee: likewise, only not in this case :) what do you mean with every command btw?
[23:45] <swaagie> im not specifically after wine btw, more after skype, but that failed due to other i386 deps and now everything seems to resolve to that, I can retry everything I did with skype ofc
[23:45] <swaagie> couldn't care less about wine

[00:16] <ryaninwa> in the online instructions for creating one it doesn't specify a location other than the default location that opens when choosing other
[00:17] <ryaninwa> can anyone please help me?
[00:17] <swaagie> ryaninwa: you sure the disk is still mounted?
[00:18] <ryaninwa> I am not sure what you mean. I am not using a disc for installation
[00:18] <wilee-nilee> ersatz, could be any number of reasons give details to the channel.
[00:18] <swaagie> ryaninwa: usb/disk/storage unit ;)
[00:18] <swaagie> ryaninwa: what are you using?
[00:19] <ryaninwa> I am using ubuntu 12.04
[00:20] <ryaninwa> The steps I am taking are: I got to dash home open startup Disk creator open it and then select other
[00:20] <ersatz> I posted on ubuntu forums http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2179974
[00:20] <swaagie> ryaninwa: nvm I didnt read properly, you already stated usb drive, question remains is it mounted, easiest is to check the 'disk' program
[00:20] <wilee-nilee> ryaninwa, open gparted take a screen shot of any and all HD's and imagebin them.
[00:21] <swaagie> gparted is not  installed by default in 12 right?

[00:22] <ryaninwa> I am having trouble locating the, "downloaded ISO file"
[00:22] <wilee-nilee> ersatz, Not much detail however with what you have posted I would guess a missing graphic driver, or the wrong one.
[00:24] <swaagie> ryaninwa: should be under ~/Downloads normally where ~ is your home folder, e.g. /home/<username>/Downloads
[00:24] <ihab> What to do after Gnome 10 release on ubuntu
[00:24] <ersatz> wilee-nilee, the thing is, I got the graphic driver working nicely.  in one case it stopped working when I installed the 32 bit version also, in the 32 bit version, it was working fine until I rebooted (one time).
[00:24] <ryaninwa> Sorry what I am trying to do is make a bootable USB drive and I am following the steps listed on http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu and I am stuck on step 4
[00:25] <k1l_> ihab: can you rephrase?
[00:25] <ihab> Step 4: you should browse to locate the .iso source file
[00:25] <ersatz> ubottu, I will certainly look at that pointer and see if I can get nomodeset to help me.
[00:25] <ubottu> ersatz: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)

[00:25] <swaagie> wilee-nilee: btw I fiddled a bit with the partner repo's so that I could install skype from the package manager, then however it bails on a lacking skype-bin and when I try to install that it borks on libqt4-dbus:i386

[00:26] <ryaninwa> WIlee nillee I am in ubuntu 12.04

[00:29] <Freeder> Hi folks, I'm looking at an example inittab line of code: zz:12345:respawn:/usr/bin/sudo -u user1 /path/to/my_daemon  . the file my_daemon ... that is the file I always want running, right? Or does that need to be code to check if a file is running?
[00:30] <reisio> does Ubuntu even use /etc/inittab anymore?
[00:30] <ryaninwa> wilnee nilee I am tryin to intall with the startup disk app http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu
[00:30] <Freeder> actually, it doesnt.
[00:30] <Freeder> hmm.
[00:30] <wilee-nilee> ryaninwa, Can you answer my last question?
[00:31] <Freeder> what is the equivilent now?
[00:31] <ryaninwa> Sorry wilee nilee was your last question about the startup disk app?
[00:32] <wilee-nilee> ryaninwa, You are not using the tab key to complete nicks, nor are you really communicating with those that address you, do you speak english?
[00:32] <swaagie> lol wtf:  wine1.4:i386 : Depends: wine1.4-i386:i386 (= 1.4.1-0ubuntu5) but it is not going to be installed
[00:32] <k1l_> swaagie: PPAs?
[00:32] <AndroUser> Hey there, i made a big blunder, i followed some tutorial to remove gnome, with some pasting, and now after a reboot my laptop is useless, i only have access to the command line, could somebody help me out to restore my system?
[00:32] <ryaninwa> wilee-nilee: sorry this is the first time I have used this forum
[00:32] <wilee-nilee> ryaninwa, Where is the iso you are trying to use?
[00:33] <swaagie> k1l_: I dunno it started with an attempt to get skype installed on 64bit 13.04, but somewhere I completely borked my repo's it seems, I already remove all custom  ppa's
[00:33] <ryaninwa> wilee-nilee:  I am not sure where it is located. I think that is the problem.
[00:34] <wilee-nilee> ryaninwa, Are you in a ubuntu install or on in a live enviroment?
[00:34] <ryaninwa> wilee-nilee:  In a live environment I believe I am currently running ubuntu
[00:34] <nishanth> i am noob at linux i just installed ubuntu with a windows 7 partion and i dont see the grub after restart can someone help me
[00:35] <Freeder> AndroUser: what did you expect to happen when you removed gnome?
[00:35] <reisio> AndroUser: you want GNOME back?
[00:35] <wilee-nilee> ryaninwa, Is the iso in another OS? you can't use the live environment as the install iso, for the install yes, but not as.
[00:35] <tarheel> lol sudo apt-get install gnome
[00:36] <reisio> lololololol
[00:36] <tarheel> ive no idea why anyone would use gnome anyway
[00:36] <reisio> ikr
[00:37] <nishanth> can someone help me with a grub issue please??
[00:37] <iklaros> can anyone help with a uefi install? i get a secure boot error on startup, i cannot turn off secure boot on this machine. what do i do?
[00:37] <ryaninwa> wilee-nilee: I downloaded and installed ubuntu alongside windows so I did install and download it with windows and this is my first time running the program
[00:37] <reisio> nishanth: any particular grub issue?
[00:37] <AndroUser> Actually i had lxde already installed, but my computer can''t recognize my graphic card!?
[00:37] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, This a wubi install, ubuntu does not install to a ntfs unless it is a wubi.
[00:38] <swaagie> k1l_: perhaps you can make anything of it, https://gist.github.com/Swaagie/6927503 some stuff I did to get skype installed, tried to revert to just single arch amd64, still seems to be still stuck somewhere on i386, now I retried and the funky shit I just linked happened
[00:38] <reisio> AndroUser: well pick a problem
[00:38] <ryaninwa> wilee-nilee: Would I need to download ubuntu again on the ubuntu OS to be able to create a bootable USB drive
[00:38] <nishanth> reisio : i installed ubuntu using a live cd and when i restart it goes directly to windows
[00:38] <wilee-nilee> ryaninwa, YOU installed from windows a wubi correct?
[00:38] <swaagie> what was that repo rebuild site again?
[00:39] <nishanth> wilee-nilee : so am i supposed to reinstall from windows using wubi?
[00:39] <AndroUser> The problem is that i don't know how to connect to the internet from the command line
[00:39] <ryaninwa> wilee-nilee: Correct I used wubi to install it
[00:39] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, I would not.
[00:40] <iklaros> no-one knows uefi and secure boot?
[00:40] <nishanth> wilee-nilee , i want ubuntu as a an option to dual boot
[00:40] <wilee-nilee> ryaninwa, I would just do another download of 12.04 to load the usb, the iso is somewhere in windows and it is accessible, but few here know wubi or how to navigate from it to windows.
[00:40] <nishanth> wilee-nilee : so how do i make my grub start at boot?
[00:41] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, Do you have more than one HD, and is this a dual boot, if so with what?
[00:41] <wilee-nilee> which windows release
[00:42] <nishanth> wilee-nilee : i have only one HD and i made a partition with windows 7
[00:42] <ryaninwa> wilee-nilee: So would you save the file to the desktop and then browse to it? If so is the ISO file end with ".ISO"
[00:42] <iklaros> nishanth: you created the partition using the tools provided by windows 7?
[00:42] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, You can't make a ubuntun partition in windows.
[00:42] <iklaros> nishanth: The recommended method is make a bootable ubuntu USB, then reboot the machine from that, and use that instsaller. That will setup grub.
[00:43] <nishanth> wilee-nilee :  i mean i made some free space and then boot from live cd
=== vemacs is now known as vemacs|ded
[00:43] <iklaros> well good luck with it,im going back to trying to sort out secure boot install, seems no-one here knows how to do UEFI
[00:44] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, Run the bootrepair app, and save the bootinfo summary ion case it does not work to post for more help. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[00:44] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, This was not originally a W8 computer with gpt right, and no raid involved?
[00:45] <nishanth> wilee-nilee : this is a win7 computer
[00:45] <nishanth> i used the disk manager to free space
[00:46] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, YOu understand my question though on gpt and raid right?
[00:47] <nishanth> wilee-nilee : i did not understand your question
[00:48] <swaagie> ok giving up
[00:48] <swaagie> stuff is utterly broken
[00:48] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, It is important to say so then, boot the live ubuntu environment and open gparted in the menu and take a screen shot of it and post it at a imagebin.
[00:48] <reisio> yay, giving up
[00:48] <swaagie> what is there evebn beyond apt to manageestuff
[00:48] <reisio> swaagie: ?
[00:48] <swaagie> reisio: ?
=== samuel_ is now known as samuel
[00:49] <reisio> swaagie: need help with something?
[00:49] <iklaros> nishanth: The way you can tell if you have GPT in windows is open command prompt, type 'diskpart' and then 'list disk'. there is a tick box in GPT if oyu have it.
[00:49] <wilee-nilee> iklaros, In windows?
[00:49] <swaagie> reisio: any help is always welcome, ill try to make a long story short
[00:49] <reisio> iklaros: what does it mean if he's got GPT?
[00:50] <iklaros> wilee-nilee: That will work in Windows 7. Linux doesn't have a monopoly on terminal commands ;-)
[00:51] <nishanth> wilee-nilee right now i am chating using on the win7 environment, am i supposed to restart from live cd?
[00:51] <wilee-nilee> iklaros, did I say they did, you have not followed the posts, but just spit out info to serve yourself.
[00:51] <iklaros> wilee-nilee: You can also do it from disk adminstrator but I can't remember which screen it's in. The command line is easier sometimes ;-)
[00:51] <swaagie> reisio: attempted to install skype, see https://gist.github.com/Swaagie/6927503, required to add arch i386, no success, reverted, state still tries to get non amd64 packages, did cleaning/rebuild repo/keys with http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/ retried same result
[00:52] <reisio> swaagie: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype
[00:52] <swaagie> obvisouly I also did all regular cleaning and rebuilding stuff in between as well,-f / clean / autoclean / --configure -a
[00:52] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, Yes, I would like to see what exactly is on the HD, if this can be fixed generally the live cd is where it would be done from, a new install made.
[00:52] <iklaros> wilee-nilee: Well I did say in the post it was on windows ... I'd say it wasn't me that wasn't following
[00:52] <swaagie> if nly it was that simple
[00:52] <nishanth> wilee-nilee ok i did what iklaros said and the section under   gpt is blank
[00:52] <wilee-nilee> or a new install*
[00:53] <swaagie> reisio: basically that page describes exactly what I did
[00:53] <iklaros> nishanth: It's MBR then, not GPT. That's cool.
[00:53] <reisio> swaagie: if it did that, I wouldn't have linked it
[00:53] <swaagie> keeps moaning about skype-bin
[00:53] <reisio> swaagie: try reading it again
[00:54] <nishanth> iklaros : so what do i do next?
[00:54] <swaagie> reisio: how would that help?
[00:55] <nishanth> wilee-nilee : i installed, deleted and reinstalled ubuntu like 3 times all the 3 times the grub was not loaded at restart
[00:55] <reisio> swaagie: if you read it again, maybe you'd read it properly
[00:56] <iklaros> nishanth: If you used the microsoft tools in disk administrator to resize the partition, you don't hav RAID either, since it can't do that on a raid.
[00:56] <swaagie> reisio: sorry didn't want to offend you, but i'd rather not play a guessing game in the middle of the night
[00:57] <reisio> swaagie: all the more reason to read
[00:57] <iklaros> nishanth: do you have any read only boot loader options set in the bios?
[00:57] <iklaros> nishanth: the bios could be preventing writes to the boot sector as a security measure
[00:58] <nishanth> iklaros , i actually dont think so, but how do i find out?
[00:58] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, Can you just do what I have suggested.
[00:59] <iklaros> nishanth: You'd need to look in the bios, it's system dependant. usually you press one of the f-keys as it boots up. but i'm goign to tell you follow wilee-nilee 's advice since im sort of AFK trying to sort out this UEFI nonsenses
[00:59] <nishanth> wilee-nilee, could you please walk me through this
[01:00] <nishanth> wilee-nilee,  what do you need a screenshot of?
[01:00] <wilee-nilee> nishanth,  boot the live ubuntu environment and open gparted in the menu and take a screen shot of it and post it at a imagebin.
[01:01] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, I'm not good at walking people through stuff, so I doubt I can help you.
[01:02] <swaagie> reisio: reread, i'm not seeing what your after, my feeling is that would have probably worked if I wouldn't have done it otherwise to start with, looking for a way back from my failure
[01:02] <nishanth> if i boot on the live cd how do i have my xchat continue?
[01:02] <reisio> swaagie: have you tried doing that at all yet?
[01:02] <wilee-nilee>  reisio Whats the key pressesto separate the channel from the list in a irc app
[01:02] <Zachintosh> Hello?
[01:02] <swaagie> reisio: of course
[01:02] <reisio> nishanth: continue?
[01:02] <reisio> Zachintosh: hi
[01:02] <rizal> nishanth, have you tried this ? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[01:03] <reisio> wilee-nilee: ctrl+i?
[01:03] <Zachintosh> what are you people up to?
[01:03] <reisio> Zachintosh: stuff, things; you?
[01:03] <wilee-nilee> reisio, Heh, thanks hit it by accident, and forgot the keys.
[01:03] <Zachintosh> Trying IRC for the first time
[01:03] <reisio> wilee-nilee: yeah, that's a rough one :p
[01:04] <wilee-nilee> Zachintosh, This is support not chat. try #ubuntu-offtopic for chat
[01:04] <reisio> Zachintosh: right on
[01:04] <iklaros> Does Canonical have a paid support service for end users?
[01:04] <MrMonkey31> quick question, ubuntu!  anyone know a linux file manager that enables you to drag to or from an open file dialog in any program, e.g. while using gimp, save as, then before picking a name you drag some files into the save as list box?  or am I thinking too 'windows'?
[01:04] <Tylertwo> nishanth, http://webchat.freenode.net/ will work for IRC
[01:04] <Zachintosh> Do any of you happen to know anything of the Chimera boot loader?
[01:04] <swaagie> reisio: purged, cleaned, and repeated the stepss again, I keep getting: The following packages have unmet dependencies:reisio  skype : Depends: skype-bin
[01:05] <wilee-nilee> Zachintosh, would not be supported here.
[01:05] <reisio> heh, samuel
[01:05] <samuel> hello!
[01:05] <reisio> MrMonkey31: which have you tried that don't?
[01:05] <reisio> samuel: sup
[01:07] <samuel> reisio: hows it going?
[01:07] <reisio> samuel: okay, over there?
[01:08] <reisio> swaagie: autoremove?
[01:08] <MrMonkey31> reisio, erm so far I've experimented with Files as included with ubuntu unity, and the viewer of XFCE whatever that is called
[01:08] <samuel> reisio: not bad, house flooded... been raining non stop for 2 days
[01:08] <swaagie> yup did that as well after purging
=== vemacs|ded is now known as vemacs
[01:08] <samuel> this is supposed to be Mexico, not England
[01:08] <iklaros> MrMonkey31: xfce uses 'thunar', ubuntu uses 'nautilus' and you're right, neither of them do it.
[01:09] <reisio> samuel: probably warmer at least :p
[01:09] <reisio> MrMonkey31: try dolphin from KDE, then
[01:10] <iklaros> MrMonkey31: I can tell you PCMan doesn't either. I have never used Dolphin so can't comment on that one.
[01:10] <samuel> reisio: yes... at least we can still say that :_
[01:10] <samuel> :)
[01:10] <MrMonkey31> iklaros, thx, that's strange my distro came with the generically named Files. whether it's a stripped down nautilus I don't know, but it didn't look like the screens I'd seen of nautilus...
[01:12] <MrMonkey31> well then, I'm going to duck out!
[01:12] <iklaros> MrMonkey31: Nautilus changed a lot, recently. Caused some controversy. ;-)
[01:14] <Smilex> I'm trying to run an apache2 server with the web root at a folder in my home folder, yet I'm get access forbidden for a sub directory. Why and how can I fix it? I've tried chmod a+r ~/web -R
[01:16] <iklaros> Smilex: Whihc user account is apache under? Your own?
[01:16] <Smilex> iklaros, how do I check that?
[01:17] <iklaros> Smilex: Is it a default ubuntu install?
[01:17] <Success> what is \xb8\x00\x00\x00
[01:17] <Smilex> iklaros, yes
[01:17] <Success> \xff\xe0
[01:18] <iklaros> Smilex: The user account for a apache is "www-data" then. You'd need to give that access. I'm going to recommend you don't for security reasons, but that's up to you
[01:19] <Smilex> iklaros, it's only for local hosting. I send it to a remote server for public use. Thanks
[01:19] <Smilex> iklaros, another question. Is that done with chown or chmod?
[01:19] <Smilex> also, chmod a+r should have given all users access
[01:20] <Success> chmod 000 -R /
[01:20] <Success> how do i recover from that
[01:21] <k1l_> Success: i dont think that is to recover.
[01:21] <iklaros> Smilex: You need chown to create files though
[01:21] <swaagie> ok time for bed, this is hopeless
[01:21] <reisio> Success: the fastest way would be to reinstall
[01:21] <swaagie> nn all
[01:22] <Success> is there a way to do it without reinstalling
[01:22] <swaagie> thx for the all the hints
[01:22] <Smilex> iklaros, doing chmod a+r ~/web -R did not fix it
[01:23] <k1l_> Success: that is impossible since you would need to set every permission of every folder and file yourself.
[01:23] <iklaros> Smilex: Yea, i said it wouldn't. Apache needs to own the files as far as I'm aware
[01:23] <reisio> Success: yes, but it'd take much longer
[01:23] <Success> you cant do chmod 777 -R / or something
[01:23] <Success> but that command fails for some reason
[01:23] <reisio> Success: you can something, but it'd take much longer
[01:23] <k1l_> Success: that will not lead to a stable system.
[01:24] <Smilex> iklaros, ok thanks
[01:24] <Success> and what about my original quetsion
[01:24] <k1l_> Success: boot up a live cd. save the files that are important to you to your backup and maka a reinstall
[01:24] <Success> what is \xb8\x00\x00\x00\xff\xe0
[01:24] <reisio> Success: in what context?
[01:25] <iklaros> Smilex: When I see this MOST people change the apache account to their own, and have it run in their account. It makes me very sad though as it's utterly insecure. And probab;y a sackable if you work as a sysop :-)
[01:25] <Success> its in a c script insigned char = that
[01:25] <Success> but someone said it was mallicous
[01:26] <Smilex> iklaros, I'm just testing it on my end, and then git pushing it to the actual server. How do I change the apache account
[01:26] <k1l_> Success: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1932954
[01:27] <iklaros> Success: char is an int in C...you've got 6 bytes there. 32 bit ints are 4 bytes.
[01:27] <reisio> Success: would take a lot more context to say if it's malicious or not
[01:28] <iklaros> Success: They're probaby assuming it's an overflow I'd guess.
=== Wug is now known as Wug[Hyperspace]
[01:28] <Success> okay
[01:28] <Success> what hapens when you get an overflow
[01:29] <Success> and can you guys run a site for me that would normally be malcious in windows
[01:29] <reisio> to what end
[01:29] <iklaros> Success: it overwrites the next char thus changing the program in an unexpected (to the programmer) way
=== peter is now known as Guest60640

[01:56] <trimeta> The medibuntu repository just went offline. What's the best way to cleanly remove this repository from my system, using the command line directly? I could just remove my /etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list file, but I don't know if that would cause potential problems.
[01:57] <brainacid> got it
[01:57] <wilee-nilee> trimeta, gksudo nautilus and delete the medibuntu text, then run a sudo apt-get update.
[01:58] <brainacid> had an i386 cd in my drive...lol
[01:58] <trimeta> ...Nautilus? This is a headless server, all I've got is vim.
[01:58] <trimeta> But if you mean "edit the file and comment out the line which references medibuntu," that I can handle.
[01:58] <wilee-nilee> trimeta, Then whay did you have medibuntu installed?
[01:59] <trimeta> For codecs? I can stream from the server to other things...and honestly, maybe I had wanted to set it up as a HTPC at some point and ended up not going forward with that.
[02:00] <wilee-nilee> trimeta, all you have to do is remove the text file from sources.list.d
[02:00] <trimeta> Is there a way to check if anything currently installed comes from that repository? Or will running an apt-get update check that for me?
[02:00] <reisio> finally, a fun chat zone :p
[02:02] <moes> I have a /boot/grub/menu.lst in my file system on 12.04 when I boot menu.lst open first and I have to select Ubuntu to proceed to the ubuntu grub display. Can I remove menu.lst and not affect my Ubuntu grub
[02:03] <reisio> moes: what's listed, just 'Ubuntu'?
[02:04] <trimeta> Anyway, since "ls /var/lib/apt/lists/|grep medibuntu" returned nothing, I'm going to assume that means I had nothing installed from that repository, and the deleting the file left me in a clean state. Very good.
[02:04] <reisio> sounds like maybe you have GRUB "legacy" booting GRUB 2
[02:04] <wilee-nilee> moes, menu.list is legacy grub you want to keep the grub 2? how do you have both?
[02:05] <moes> reisio, The title the (hdo,o) and an entry Kernel /boot/grub/core.img
[02:06] <moes> wilee-nilee, This was caused by a bad duel boot
[02:06] <reisio> moes: probably start with https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[02:07] <wilee-nilee> moes, hardly explains it but okay.
[02:08] <wilee-nilee> moes, You can purge both from the desktop of the kept install and reload one and load the mbr.
[02:10] <moes> wilee-nilee, What if I just remove and purge menu.lst as there are no other files installed from the duel boot
[02:11] <dustinspringman> okay ubuntu server experts... need some help...
[02:11] <wilee-nilee> moes, If you want a definitive answer run the bootrepair app, just the bootinfo summary and post the url to that script.
[02:11] <wilee-nilee> dustinspringman, #ubuntu-server
[02:11] <wilee-nilee> I suspect they are experts
[02:12] <dustinspringman> wilee-nilee: thanks much, headed that way
[02:12] <moes> wilee-nilee, Okay thanks for the info
[02:13] <wilee-nilee> moes, I can't really say that removing a menu.list without knowing what is reallt there and where its at is all.
[02:14] <wilee-nilee> moes, I suspect all you really have to do is reload the mbr with the kept installs grub is all, sounds like the bad dual boot is still there and in the mbr.
[02:19] <dsnyders> Can anyone recommend a good context sensitive editor?
[02:19] <moes> wilee-nilee, Well if all else fails I have good backup on cd's and dvd's
[02:20] <semitones> i forget, does unetbootin let you have many isos on one usb drive?
[02:20] <kieppie1> howdy
[02:21] <kieppie1> I have a new laptop, but for some reason they decided not to ship it with a contextual menu key. how can I remap my caps as the context key (presently disabled)
[02:21] <kieppie1> ?
[02:21] <kieppie1> or maybe there is a command I can call to init the menu/cotext key behaviour & then I can map it to a shortcut
[02:23] <nishanth> i have a windows partition on my hard drive grub do not list it, could someone help?

[02:26] <kieppie1> anyone available online to assist/advice re keybindings, please?
[02:26] <Dr_Willis> i tend to use geany for my text editong needs.. or vim. ;)
[02:27] <Dr_Willis> kieppie1:  state the question, and id suggest checking askubuntu.com - i think theres a lot of info about that on their site.
[02:28] <kieppie1> got a new laptop, but does not have a contextual menu key, and my touchpad is somwhat sensitive (with no buttons), making click & crag & right-cick tricky
[02:29] <dsnyders> Dr_Willis: apparently pluma is a fork of gedit.
[02:29] <kieppie1> I'd like to remap my caps to act as my contextual menu (right-click) & possiblibly something like shift+caps or alt+super as left-click
[02:30] <nishanth> i have a windows 7 partition on on my HD my grub do not list it , could someone help?

[02:32] <kieppie1> Dr_Willis - essentially, yes, but the important one is to hook the context menu key/right-click 1st. cant locate that option in the keyboard tweak tool
[02:32] <Dr_Willis> nishanth:  looks like it found windows 7 to me. one is your install. one is your windows boot, or recovery p[artiopn
[02:33] <Dr_Willis> kieppie1:  ive never done it. so really cant suggest more then to check askubuntu.com
[02:33] <kieppie1> hmmm
[02:33] <kieppie1> thatnks
[02:33] <kieppie1> know how to call up the right-click/context menu from CLI?
[02:33] <Dr_Willis> kieppie1:  if the grub menu does not show the 2 windows entries. then its possible you are booting the wrong hard drive. and booting a differnt grub.
[02:33] <nishanth> Dr_Willis : when i boot i dont see it as options
[02:34] <Dr_Willis> oops wrong nick. l)
[02:34] <kieppie1> ;)
[02:34] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, do you use the arrow keys to go down the grub list?
[02:34] <nishanth> wilee-nilee yeah
[02:34] <Dr_Willis> nishanth:  you could also put a custome grub entry to boot windows in /etc/grub.d/40_custom
[02:35] <Dr_Willis> nishanth:  if your custom entries dont show. that would definatly point to grub not being the same as the grub you are booting
[02:35] <wilee-nilee> probably missing the boot menu, or there is no boot flag
[02:35] <nishanth> Dr_Willis so what do i have to exactly?
[02:35] <Dr_Willis> i dident think grub paied attention to the boot flag. but for windows booting.. not sure
[02:36] <chainsaw> hello!
[02:36] <wilee-nilee> nishanth, If you had the bootinfo summary tp post from the boot repair app we could be not guessing here.

[02:36] <Guest79319> anyone want to help me with bash scripting?
[02:36] <Dr_Willis> nishanth:  a bootinfo summary would answer most of the 20 questions that are going to be asked next.. ;) like.. how many hard drioves to you have
[02:36] <Dr_Willis> Guest79319:  ask the question and see. and theres always #bash
[02:37] <Guest79319> oooooh
[02:37] <Guest79319> I going to hit that channel
[02:37] <nishanth> Dr_Willis : so how do i get a bootinfo summary?
[02:37] <Dr_Willis> of course #bash will most likely refer you to the docs
[02:37] <jon8> I'm having problems adding a user to the www-data group and being able to overwrite files. I followed this tutorial, http://tinyurl.com/kuqmuny ..however I'm still getting permission denied when trying to edit and save a file within /var/www

[02:47] <Tylertwo> I installed Debian (after Ubuntu, and as a dual boot) and Debian reformatted Grub's appearance on startup. I want it to go back to Ubuntu's Grub appearance. I tried "sudo update-grub" from Ubuntu which seemed like it was working, but when I rebooted it was still Debian's screen. Any ideas?

[03:03] <scottb> wilee-nilee, thanks will do
[03:04] <cheapie> Is there an easy way to send keypresses to another terminal? I have a monitor showing some stats over sort of close to me, and I would like to control it remotely.
[03:05] <wilee-nilee> cheapie, THis spying on another's session?
[03:06] <cheapie> No... I can see the monitor from over here anyway, I just want to control it.
[03:08] <cheapie> wilee-nilee: It's sitting there running htop, and I'd like to be able to change screens and such without having to get up and go over there. I can see what it's doing from here, though.
[03:09] <sujx> thx
[03:09] <fxhp> cheapie: research screen + ssh
[03:09] <fxhp> screen and ssh
[03:10] <wilee-nilee> cheapie, Not sure here.
[03:10] <fxhp> wilee-nilee - I just gave him the answer
[03:10] <wilee-nilee> fxhp, good for you.
[03:11] <wilee-nilee> he asked me a question I was just answering
[03:11] <somsip> cheapie: as fxhp says, stop htop on the remote. Run screen on the remote. Run htop on screen. then ssh from your PC and attach to the session of screen
[03:12] <cheapie> somsip: I'm going to go try that now....
[03:12] <somsip> cheapie: and for screen, you can use tmux, byobu and...maybe others
[03:13] <fxhp> somsip cheapie I think screen ships with ubuntu
[03:14] <somsip> fxhp: ah. Always used tmux myself, but I live and learn
[03:15] <cheapie> somsip: I started screen (with the -R option, like some random guide online suggested), and started htop within that. Now what? When I go to the other terminal (and login as the same user) and run screen, I don't see htop anywhere. Just a bash prompt.
[03:15] <somsip> cheapie: you created a new session of screen. You need to do something like 'screen ls' to get a list of existing sessions then 'screen -a {sessionId}' to connect to it.
[03:15] <somsip> cheapie: Like I say, I use tmux so you will have to man screen to get the right commands
=== OGRE is now known as Guest33376
[03:17] <fxhp> cheapie - from your other computer you need to ssh to the computer running screen+htop
[03:17] <fxhp> cheapie - then invoke 'screen -rd'
[03:19] <cheapie> fxhp: That made it show up on my local terminal, but it went away on the remote monitor. Is there a way to attach it to two terminals at one time?
=== Guest33376 is now known as THE_OGRE
[03:21] <fxhp> cheapie - yup
[03:21] <cheapie> fxhp: I just tried tmux, and that seems to be working.
[03:21] <bob---> Hey in linux when i run counter-strike in 4:3 video there's no black bars like in windows
[03:22] <bob---> where in ubuntu can you change this?
[03:22] <bob---> i seen no video settings
[03:23] <fxhp> cheapie - http://www.debian-administration.org/article/Using_GNU_screen%27s_multiuser_feature_for_remote_support
[03:23] <fxhp> cheapie: you got sharing working with tmux?
[03:23] <fxhp> cheapie: gratz
[03:24] <fxhp> bob--- you want the black bars, aka you want to stop it from zooming?
[03:24] <bob---> yes
[03:24] <bob---> 4:3 full screen is stretching
[03:24] <fxhp> bob---: bummer
[03:24] <fxhp> are you using wine?
[03:24] <bob---> nope steam
[03:24] <bob---> its native for linux now
[03:24] <fxhp> oh yeah I forgot the ported
[03:25] <cheapie> fxhp: Yeah, I started tmux on the terminal that should always be running htop, and started htop in that. Then I SSHed into that box, and run "tmux attach". Now I just have to figure out how to unattach it... yes, I am ReadingTFM right now,
[03:25] <fxhp> it doesn't do that for me, although I'm wondering why you are playing with that aspect ratio
[03:25] <fxhp> cheapie - cool, nice work, make sure you stick around to give pointers!
[03:25] <bob---> competitive gamers generally use 640x480 800x600
[03:26] <fxhp> ...
[03:26] <bob---> a lot of the casual gamers max out their resolution
[03:26] <fxhp> bob---: are you sure about that?
[03:26] <bob---> yes im positive
[03:26] <somsip> cheapie: CTRL A then CTRL D (from memory) to detach
=== vemacs is now known as vemacs|ded
[03:27] <fxhp> bob---: why would a competitive gamer use a resolution from the early 90's?
[03:27] <bob---> in counter-strike\css\csgo it's easier to hit shots
[03:27] <cheapie> somsip: Turns out it's Ctrl-A then D (not Ctrl-D). Everything seems to be working great now.
[03:28] <ampw> the effect to make windows transparent when moving them and wiggle.
[03:28] <ampw> which is it?
[03:28] <fxhp> bob---: the hitbox is related to the end users resolution, that has to be the crappiest idea ever
[03:28] <somsip> cheapie: sorry - you're right. Finger memory is good, but brain memory nowadays...meh ;)
[03:28] <bob---> no it's not
[03:29] <cheapie> somsip: I also just found out that SIGHUP detaches it, so I don't even need to worry about that.

[03:30] <fxhp> cheapie: isn't screen/tmux amazing?
[03:31] <JoshDreamland> I can't log in to my account; something crashes and I'm taken back to LightDM. Has something changed that would cause this?
[03:31] <wilee-nilee> ampw, http://askubuntu.com/questions/203064/wobbly-windows-effect-missing-from-12-10
[03:31] <cheapie> fxhp: I haven't played around with the window management that it promises to do, but the one-program-in-multiple-terminals thing is quite cool. Reminds me of VNC, somewhat.
[03:32] <JoshDreamland> It's local to my settings, as the guest account works fine.
[03:32] <JoshDreamland> Was something updated that doesn't like old settings? I've tried five different desktop environments.
[03:32] <bob---> anyone know where xorg.conf is?
[03:33] <JoshDreamland> bob---: /etc/X11

[03:33] <dvineone> Hi

[03:36] <JoshDreamland> so I guess I'll fix it myself
[03:36] <javanic> anyone have any idea why when I delete large files from my hd it doesn't seem to free up any space? I'm stumped here lol
[03:37] <somsip> javanic: how are you deleting them?
[03:37] <cheapie> javanic: Did you empty the trash?
[03:37] <javanic> "send to trash" then empty
[03:38] <dvineone> shift + delete will delete them permanently
[03:38] <somsip> javanic: you could check they are really being deleted from trash. No idea why they shouldn't though
[03:38] <javanic> <somsip> how do i check?
[03:38] <cheapie> While I'm here... does anybody know of a good font that looks like plain text-mode? Courier is rather difficult to read in comparison.
[03:39] <somsip> cheapie: Monospace?
[03:40] <cheapie> javanic: Doesn't Ubuntu ship with a file usage analyzer thingy? That might show you where they went.
[03:41] <dvineone> there is a terminal command that will show you what amount of disk space is being used file systems are using
=== jack is now known as Guest99183
[03:41] <javanic> <cheapie> I have no idea.. but it's strange, when i use gparted it shows that I have like NO space on my HD but I can still download large files. The only thing that doesn't seem to work is when I try to download updates
[03:42] <javanic> <dvineone> what is the terminal command?
[03:42] <cheapie> somsip: Unfortunately, I'm SSHing into the server from Windows, so that font isn't preinstalled. But, browsing through the list, I found "Terminal", which looks quite nice.
[03:42] <somsip> javanic: du -h . (fromt he directory you want to check). It will be slow in large directories
[03:42] <cheapie> javanic: That sounds strange... Does fsck complain about anything?
[03:43] <somsip> javanic: well, not slow, but excessively verbose
[03:44] <dvineone> df is the command
[03:44] <javanic> to be honest, my knowledge of how to navigate around terminal is very limited.. I was fluent in DOS but linux base is relatively new to me
[03:44] <dvineone> you will need to searchy the man page to see how to specify it to a certain directory
[03:45] <dvineone> or du may be it
[03:45] <cheapie> I think it's du. df is for the whole disk,

[04:00] <javanic> do updates download to a different partition then regular downloads then?
[04:00] <cheapie> javanic: You should be okay for a while then. The problem was that the kernels go in /boot, and you had a lot of old ones there.
[04:01] <javanic> <cheapie> thanks for the help!
[04:02] <javanic> <cheapie> does it have to do with how my HD is partitioned?
[04:02] <cheapie> javanic: Regular updates go in /, and you had plenty of space there. When the kernel (the core of the OS) gets updated (that's when it makes you reboot), that goes in /boot.
[04:03] <cheapie> javanic: Sort of. A bigger /boot partition would make it take longer to fill up. The only real solution would be to never update (not recommended), or to autoremove every month or so.
[04:05] <javanic> <cheapie> ok, so if it happens again i'll just do the autoremove.. thanks again for your help!

[04:45] <reisio> it's like mount -o loop for software that is really picky, IIRC
[04:45] <reisio> software that won't just take a path
[04:46] <Dr_Willis> so it emulates an actual /dev/sr0 then?
[04:46] <reisio> I hope so, otherwise it has no advantage over mount :p
[04:47] <Dr_Willis> cant recall ever needing any thing like thatin linux. :) but its not in the repos any more it seems.. so aparently not many other people needed it either
[04:47] <reisio> most software should be happy with a loopback _path_
[04:47] <sunny_> i can use qemu if there is not virtualization support ?
[04:47] <reisio> Windows software is the kind that makes assumptions, or that, as commercial software, requires you to have things like discs
[04:48] <reisio> sunny_: qemu yes, qemu with kvm no
[04:48] <zykotic10> sunny_: yes.  qemu don't require it, but it's slow...
[04:48] <reisio> but without virt extensions, virtualbox would be faster
[04:48] <jmabudabi> "so it emulates an actual /dev/sr0 then?" No.
[04:48] <jmabudabi> Unknowingly installed. Thought would work. And it did not want deleted. I did using this deleted
[04:49] <reisio> just an unnecessary Windows analogue, then
[04:49] <Dr_Willis> jmabudabi:  installed  how exactly?
[04:49] <sunny_> reisio, virtulabox would be faster than qemu if their is no virtualization support ?
[04:49] <reisio> sunny_: yup
[04:49] <jmabudabi> Now I get confused in the comments and responses
[04:50] <reisio> qemu with kqemu might be comparable, but that's apparently not supported anymore, and it's kind of involved to use anyways
[04:50] <Dr_Willis> jmabudabi:  your statements are equally confuseing. You want to Install or remove cdemu >?

[04:51] <jmabudabi> I deleted it, but the kernel module has an effect. Google Translate.

[05:10] <lmint> Is there a modified version of Ubuntu available that doesnt send data to a server?
[05:10] <reisio> lmint: hrmm?
[05:11] <cfhowlett> lmint, ?  huh?
[05:11] <lmint> I thought that Ubuntu had this feature that sent data to a server that was owned by the company that develops Ubuntu
[05:11] <lmint> I think users were complaining about the privacy implications
[05:12] <cfhowlett> !nounity|lmint,
[05:12] <ubottu> lmint,: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, from 12.10 an up install the "ubuntu-gnome-desktop" package. From 11.04 to 12.04, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[05:12] <cfhowlett> !lens
[05:12] <zykotic10> lmint: that's basically "off topic" here.  but that would be an interesting fork.  but if you use unity, then yes, everything you type into unity - does go back to canonical.
[05:12] <Paulus68_1> freaky[t]: try out this guide http://linuxtutorialscratchpad.blogspot.be/2013/01/dual-boot-windows-8-and-ubuntu-1210.html

[05:12] <reisio> lmint: there's a package that helps amazon sell you things
[05:13] <reisio> lmint: it's uninstallable
[05:13] <cfhowlett> lmint, they're complaining about a feature in lens.  to do without, logout, choose a non-unity desktop environment, login.  no data sharing.
[05:13] <reisio> but if you aren't into Canonical, you can just use Debian
[05:14] <wilee-nilee> hehe its debian either way, ;)
[05:15] <reisio> but not Canonical
[05:15] <lmint> That seems like alot of trouble.   No I am not interested in the operating system doing anything on my behalf, I dont understand why developers think that. If I want to buy something on Amazon for example, I will go to www.amazon.com and find it. By sending a users search terms to some server, this means that I would have to censor myself so as to not search anything I would not want Amazon and Ubunto and who knows who else to know about. That i
[05:15] <lmint> s a hassle
[05:15] <FloodBot1> lmint: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.

[05:16] <Dr_Willis> this has been argued to death in the forums and at blog sites lmint. we really dont care to discuss it either way in this channel. its a rather pointless discussion even on the forums.
[05:16] <cfhowlett> lmint, you can negate the issue in less than a minute but using a different desktop environment or do a little more work and choose a different ubuntu.  So easy a caveman could do it.
[05:17] <lmint> Signs of censorship here are already starting to appear..this is "off topic", now we cant type in a way that is interpreted as "flooding"
[05:17] <wilee-nilee> lmint, the lenzezs are unity only and can be turned off
[05:17] <Dr_Willis> 13.10 does have more fine tuned control of lenes and that stuff ive noticed

[06:49] <foofoobar> 1) update kernel
[06:49] <foofoobar> 2) install a backport
[06:49] <foofoobar> This is the thread: http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/os-applications/f/4613/t/19515554.aspx

[06:52] <foofoobar> gulag2013, the wires for the wireless connection? :D
[06:52] <foofoobar> The wireless ap is a connection I'm using a long time, just with a different notebook
[06:52] <foofoobar> Ben64, I cant replace the card of my notebook
[06:52] <Ben64> you probably can, but i meant usb
[06:54] <foofoobar> uh, no. I dont want to attach a usb wireless every time
[06:54] <foofoobar> It would be nice to get this card working on ubuntu
[06:54] <foofoobar> I read that on windows it has no problems
[06:54] <foofoobar> There are also two suggestions on the thread
[06:54] <Ben64> get a tiny one
[06:55] <foofoobar> I'm just trying to figure out which is the better one
[06:55] <Ben64> can stay plugged in all the time
[06:55] <foofoobar> No, this is not a solution for me :/
[06:55] <foofoobar> This notebook is new. I dont want to extend it because of a software bug
[06:56] <foofoobar> so .. backport or linux kernel update? :)
[06:56] <Ben64> you don't want to extend the notebook?
[06:56] <Ben64> what does that even mean
[06:57] <gordonjcp> foofoobar: I don't see anything in your paste that suggests a problem
[06:58] <cfhowlett> foofoobar, backport is the "safer" method I would say.
[06:58] <gordonjcp> foofoobar: have you filed a bug?
[06:59] <cfhowlett> foofoobar, Also, let me point out that LTS is the preferred OS so 12.04.3
