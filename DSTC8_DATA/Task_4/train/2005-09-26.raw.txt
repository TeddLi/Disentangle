[06:54] <pablo928>  Seveas:ok  thanks for the info
[06:54] <Seveas> boxerboy, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg may help
[06:54] <boxerboy> i did that
[06:54] <brenner> linner: not quite sure what you mean, but just choose default if possible
[06:54] <Seveas> ashzero, libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 - The GNU stdc++ library
[06:54] <Seveas> you need that package
[06:54] <ChrZZ> Feel like I'm talking do the def ;)

[09:22] <jeansch> Cesarin, ok
[09:22] <Cesarin> it was the "breezy"
[09:22] <Cesarin> and installedf it
[09:22] <Cesarin> but like i said, it worked fine by the CD
[09:22] <jeansch> Cesarin, breezy changes everydays
[09:22] <Cesarin> until tuntil the patches
[09:22] <DaSkreech> packages.ubuntu.com is not very helpful :-(
[09:22] <elad`> I configured my modem for pppoe, but Ubuntu doesn't recognize it (I'm back on WinXP to ask you what to do). Help?
[09:22] <Cesarin> I installed the patches it told me to download
[09:22] <Cesarin> and BANG, restarted and now it doesnt detect my mouse
[09:22] <pauldaoust> oh yeah! that was my second question: has anyone been trying Breezy on old hardware with modest specs, say, between 400 MHz and 800 MHz? I'm concerned about upgrading to GTK+ 2.8 with its new Cairo dependency, if the old machinery in this school will grind to a screeching halt.
[09:22] <Cesarin> I just want to fix it. I supose its the only problem
[09:22] <ompaul> elad`, what kind of modem is it?
[09:22] <esac_> is it difficult to get wireless working with WPA (windows radius server) ?
[09:22] <Cesarin> isnt there another way?
[09:22] <jeansch> Cesarin, ok, well, re-install it, and wait for the release before upgrade it

[09:26] <Cesarin> whats the command to close x-chat-text btw?
[09:26] <nalioth> boxerboy29: you can upgrade
[09:26] <boxerboy29> what program?
[09:26] <Cesarin> I think ill give irssi I think ill try irssi
[09:26] <ompaul> elad`, if you have ethernet on your PC connected to Ethernet on the modem then it is not the modem it is your ethernet :) please try system - administration - networking
[09:26] <nalioth> Cesarin: click the "x" at the top right corner
[09:26] <blekos> when I play a cd then close it, and try to reloaded i get the message that cdda://dev/hdb is not available...

[09:27] <boxerboy29> lol
[09:27] <esac_> cesarin : why aren't you in X ?
[09:27] <cesarin> esac_: because X got destroyed by a mouse problem
[09:28] <glDaher> nobody could advice me on that?
[09:28] <cesarin> it keeps giving me fatal error
[09:28] <ompaul> cesarin,  running breezy?
[09:28] <cesarin> "no core pointer"
[09:28] <nalioth> breezy ate cesarin's X
[09:28] <glDaher> I can give details on what I want, but.. pff
[09:28] <cesarin> ompual: sadly yeah
[09:28] <esac_> cesarin : probably because it can't find your mouse. downgrade to udev 12 and then restart udev and restart gdm

[09:28] <esac_> cesarin: yes that is your problem then
[09:29] <cesarin> esac_: give me the full things I have to type, since im a noob
[09:29] <cesarin> <-- installed linux yesterday too :P
[09:29] <ompaul> cesarin, breezy is development - it will break - that is the way of development - it has to be this way so that bugs are fixed for release
[09:29] <cesarin> ompaul: well I had the mistake of burning it, thinking it was the "stable" release
[09:29] <ompaul> cesarin, for you stable is a better bet 5.04
[09:29] <atha> try "sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install udev" if the udev from your mirror is updated to the working version
[09:30] <cesarin> ompaul: well yes
[09:30] <ompaul> cesarin, well I suggest u get hoary and enjoy it :)
[09:30] <cesarin> esac_: ok then that means theres no way to fix a mouse problem ? :P
