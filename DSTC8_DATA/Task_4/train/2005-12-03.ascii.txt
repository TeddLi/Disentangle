[05:29] <pppoe_dude> doesnt ubuntu stability depend heavily on the kernel? so i think it's unfair to call ubuntu (or any other distro for that matter) "unstable"
[05:29] <dabaR> no not really.
[05:30] <threeseas> I still have lockups, but it seems to takle less time before it happens
[05:30] <dabaR> depends on how you define stability.
[05:30] <indigirl1> Ep|phany: where do you adjust sound from? inside amarok or from a mixer program? i would suggest using a mixer program, for example alsamixer, or something similar
[05:30] <kvantti> yeah, a software that is at version 10 is rarely unstable..but gnome is much stable than kde to my experience, and every piece of software is a part of the system..so stability does not depend solely on the system ever

[05:31] <cast> pppoe_dude: of course it does. the stability of a system is the sum of its parts, if any part is unstable that renders the whole system unstable. thus its just to call the system unstable, and fwiw there are other kernels around ;), not to mention more tried versions then 2.6

[05:44] <sethk> Reid, you have to look at the X log
[05:44] <tritium> Reid, first places to look are at your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and /var/log/Xorg.0.log

[05:47] <Reid> alright,my laptop lost power, i'm rebooting and getting the same error
[05:47] <sethk> indigirl1, it is very unlikely that it will allow you to remount read/write, but even if it will, that's not what you need to be doing.
[05:47] <cast> what would happen if you mounted over the top of /?
[05:47] <dabaR> F-Lazer: help in what way...

[05:49] <Reid> is there any way to fix that?
[05:49] <F-Lazer> yupp, its installed
[05:49] <sethk> Reid, hm.  that sounds perhaps like dri support is missing from the kernel
[05:49] <pppoe_dude> so anyone notices constant/intermittent harddisk activity in breezy? i think it has to do with ext3... but i'm sure theres some variable that i can cchange
[05:49] <dabaR> F-Lazer: and you would like us to help you write HTML?
[05:49] <sethk> Reid, is this a standard installation?
[05:49] <indigirl1> Reid: maybe comment out the dri line in your x config file
[05:50] <varsendagger> -watching streaming tv with mplayer?
[05:50] <F-Lazer> isnt there complete forums n stuff u just download?
[05:50] <Reid> i had to put in the command linux vga=771 for laptop moniter compatibility

[05:50] <kvantti> F-Lazer basic html tutorials are very common on the web. and apache configuration should be explained on the website in completion
[05:50] <dabaR> F-Lazer: there is. start with what ubotu sends you.
[05:50] <sethk> Reid, I had to do that on install also on my radeon box
[05:51] <indigirl1> Reid: this error and the vga thing are unrelated
[05:51] <sethk> Reid, once installed, it was ok
[05:51] <kvantti> F-Lazer also search for apache in the ubuntu forums..
[05:51] <F-Lazer> havent got that far... i barely got it to install
[05:51] <F-Lazer> im totally new to this
[05:51] <sethk> Reid, you chose the default kernel to install?
[05:51] <Reid> yes
[05:51] <F-Lazer> tried on a win pc too but i cant figure it out
[05:51] <sethk> Reid, strange.  You can try removing the dri module from /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[05:52] <sethk> Reid, before you make any changes to that file, back it up.
[05:52] <sethk> Reid, there is also an apt-get command that reconfigures X.  Try that also.
[05:52] <cast> /dev/hda3             6.5G  574M  5.6G  10% /mnt/hda3

[05:52] <kvantti> F-Lazer type the command /join #apache ..seems to be a very popular channel
=== cast ponders then gives up screwing around
[05:52] <sethk> someone, tell Reid that magic apt-get incantation?
[05:52] <F-Lazer> i've read faq and support pages.. but they are so complicated anf filled with holes
[05:52] <indigirl1> i cant even read a manpage about remount. lol. man: can't create a temporary filename: Read-only file system
[05:52] <sethk> indigirl1, of course
[05:52] <F-Lazer> ok
[05:53] <pppoe_dude> indigirl1: lol, do a init 0
[05:53] <sethk> indigirl1, but I told you, mount/remount is totally irrelevant
[05:53] <sethk> indigirl1, you have to look at /var/log/messages, and/or dmesg, and see what happened and fix it.
[05:53] <indigirl1> sethk: ill probably run an e2fsk or whatever that program is to fix any errors
[05:53] <cast> indigirl1: use zcat|less?
[05:53] <dabaR> F-Lazer: you can write "localhost" in your browser and press enter, taht will atke you to your home page of your computer. Other than that, you have to think of what exactly you want set up, and then ask us how to set it up.
[05:53] <sethk> indigirl1, highly unlikely to work.  but you can try.

[05:56] <pppoe_dude> indigirl1, you can always try... that used to happen to me when i e2fsck'd my hda, and then i got stuck and couldn't remount... so maybe best bet is to reboot
[05:56] <sethk> Reid, but I think I'd try the X reconfig first.
[05:56] <kvantti> varsendagger no, i plan on using it with a dvb-t usb device after christmas..but it looks like the soft for you is mythvideo which is found in the synaptic

[07:12] <kestas> vaioubuntu, to do what?
[07:13] <vaioubuntu> my aim is to use a program called checkinstall to make sourcecode into ubuntu packages
[07:13] <Syntux> moribus,  d/l from mozilla, tar and link to desktop
[07:13] <kestas> vaioubuntu, well install gcc, make, autoconf, whatever else you need
[07:14] <vaioubuntu> this is the first time ive used linux.  i have no idea of what and where with linux.  can i get gcc, make, etc with the add application program?
[07:15] <cafuego> mark_: what's that supposed to do?
[07:15] <mark_> it should just echo the vmstat output every second
[07:15] <Madpilot> vaioubuntu: there's thousands of packages in the Ubuntu repos, you can probably get 99% of what you want w/o compiling a thing. What apps are you looking for?
[07:15] <cafuego> mark_: 'vmstat 2' does that
[07:15] <cafuego> Why would you pipe it into awk?
[07:16] <moribus> syntux: should be fine. however, I am fan of using intended software to get tasks done. When I select "remove" for firefox, I don't get all those dependancies. Is somthing else borked? How did you break firefox in the first place??
