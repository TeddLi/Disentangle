<s> <user> : 9.04 is still good untill end of october when support runs out , and 8.04 has untill the end of april next year , and thats still a good version </s>
<s> <user> : just prefer to be up-to-date . find some packages do n't seem to be available in add/remove programs , etc . etc . </s>

<s> <user> , just an fyi , but whatever grub you installed most recently , is probably in control - so you 'll probably have to configure grub in whatever the " other " os is . </s>

<s> <user> , no , there are no lights on the computer . also , if i set my netbook up as a bridge and plug this computer into that , it works fine , so it 's not hw , it 's my home netowork ( which i 'm not admin of ) </s>
<s> <user> : use a virtual machine like virtual box </s>
<s> <user> : since which version </s>

<s> so now , how do i uninstall itunes from wine ? </s>
<s> <user> : of course . but ubuntu does n't support lpia anymore , so the recommended upgrade path ( since i 'm not aware of any community supported lpia effort ) is debian . </s>
<s> <user> : it was dropped for 10.04 , and pretty bad in 9.10 . there is no supported upgrade path for lpia users ; if you have one , you're recommended to reinstall with a sane architecture . </s>
