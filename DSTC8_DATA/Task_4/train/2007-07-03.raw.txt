[04:33] <ubuntuEdg1> can i stop xserver
[04:33] <Nutubuntu> |capirra, might be a good idea to not load the entire collection at once; depending on your hardware things could get slow - better to symlink to the ones you want for a particular job from ~/.fonts I would think
[04:33] <ubuntuEdg1> sudo /etc/ini.d/xserver stop
[04:34] <spheard> how do I format my USB drive? I just got a 400GB maxtor thing and my mate with a mac managed to screw it all up :-/
[04:34] <|capirra> ohh i was going to copy everything into that directory :D
[04:34] <stack_> I upgraded a machine from breezy -> dapper -> edgy -> feisty.  I just did the dist-upgrade from edgy -> feisty and rebooted.  Now I don't get a login prompt.  I see the last "Running local boot scripts" line from init, but no prompt.  I checked /etc/rc.local, but it only contains 'exit 0'.  This is a server install.  Any ideas?
[04:34] <|capirra> hehe thx for the advice
[04:34] <Pici> ubuntuEdg1: er, I dont think theres an init.d entry for the xserver.

[04:36] <ubuntuEdg1> ahh ok
[04:36] <Nutubuntu> |capirra, yes it does. experiment a bit if need be; it's straightforward. for instance you could build a directory of symlinks to the particular font files for "this book we're doing" and cp it into ~/.fonts when you're actually working that project ... delete or mv the directory out of ~/.fonts when you don't need them (and that way they don't make a huge dropdown mess everytime you look for an individual font too)
[04:36] <Nutubuntu> |capirra, "yes" meaning directories under ~/.fonts work fine

[04:39] <g[r] eek> ok this is bizarre. if i connect my "internet" cable to my ubuntu box, it works fine. however, if i connect this internet cable to my hub, and then connect my ubuntu box to the hub, it doesnt connect to the internet. my windows box is connected to the same hub and it connects to the net just fine (i am here via my windows box). thus i know its not the hub. any ideas?

[04:39] <bowens> Hi, I have a strange issue with my USB drive.  when I run DF to show disk space, it shows that no matter what I delete it's not freeing space.  However, on my windows machine it shows the free space.  I've run checkdisk and fsck but this doesn't seem to make any difference, any ideas?
[04:39] <Bo^Dick> g[r] eek: observe that some cables might be red or white depending on their type
[04:39] <|capirra> too time consuming :)
[04:39] <Nutubuntu> |capirra best of luck - I'm unclear on the production process so I'm just guessing at "pipeline" but I would think you'll find what you want - this is a very friendly and flexible environment :)

[04:57] <Dr_willis> FurryNemesis,  Ubuntu has been doing a lot of tweaks and other things - I know their 'upstart' system is different. but it works so well with its backward compatiblity with SYsV no one notices its changed. :)
[04:57] <g[r] eek> my dns's are set in /etc/resolv.conf
[04:57] <FurryNemesis> ah
[04:57] <Pici> Bo^Dick: It only searches the repositories that you have enabled.
[04:57] <Frogzoo> g[r] eek: that wasn't the question
[04:57] <Dr_willis> FurryNemesis,  like the bot said. Dont use the debian repos. :) the actuall ussage of the machines should be about the same.
