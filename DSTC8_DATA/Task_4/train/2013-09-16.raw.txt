[01:23] <Dr_Willis> chsados:  i recall it working fine befor. Now its spreading across the 2 monitors for me
[01:24] <chsados> yea thats what that url states how to fix
[01:24] <Dr_Willis> that url seems invalid
[01:24] <Dr_Willis> The server is temporarily unable to service your request due

[01:27] <Levi_> wow its quiet too quiet
[01:27] <mrrcp> yep
[01:27] <mrrcp> sunday funday
[01:27] <Dr_Willis> Sunday Night at 9:00 everyone is rushing to get homework done. ;P
[01:27] <mrrcp> everyone is asleep
[01:27] <dhyana> s am
[01:27] <dhyana> :P
[01:27] <mrrcp> or watching the game
[01:27] <chsados> Dr_Willis: try http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.rizsilverthorn.net/linux/xbmc-on-dual-monitors/
[01:27] <wilee-nilee> ssh I'm meditating
[01:27] <Levi_> i know i am like that on sunday @Dr_WIllis
[01:28] <natural> can i make the system monitor go transparent when inactive?
[01:28] <Dr_Willis> chsados:  so whats the problem?
[01:29] <natural> how do i make all inactive windows transparent?
[01:30] <Dr_Willis> natural:  theres a compiz plugin i recall that can do that
[01:30] <qin> natural: reverting to 10.10? and compiz
[01:30] <natural> yeah i was thinking without compiz
[01:30] <natural> nahi have 13.04 64 biot
[01:30] <Dr_Willis> !ccsm
[01:30] <ubottu> To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Ubuntu: install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' (or 'simple-ccsm' for pre-Oneiric). If you install the latter, a new option will appear in your appearance properties - See also !compiz - Help in #compiz
[01:30] <natural> i jsut like it when my windows go transp[arent when inactive
[01:31] <natural> do i need to restart computer?
[01:32] <natural> hey ubottu a bot?
[01:32] <kostkon> natural, logout
[01:32] <natural> can i just sudo apt-get intall compiz?
[01:32] <kostkon> natural, unity is a compiz plugin thus you are laready running it
[01:33] <natural> ah
[01:33] <tjbiddle> Hey guys - Why can I not add nameservers to my /etc/resolv.conf and have them resolve - Instead I have to add them to my domain registrar?
[01:33] <Dr_Willis> compiz IS installed bvy default. the ccsm tool is not
[01:33] <natural> so what's my next step to get the full set of bells and whistles?
[01:33] <kostkon> natural, just install the ccsm app
[01:33] <Dr_Willis> brb.
[01:33] <wilee-nilee> or the config manager
[01:33] <natural> over in the software center kost?
[01:33] <natural> kostkon, ^
[01:33] <kostkon> natural, y
[01:33] <natural> cool
[01:34] <kostkon> natural, careful what you are doing though. don't disable the wrong plugins for example
[01:34]  * wilee-nilee waits for the my desktop is broken after messing with compiz
[01:34] <kostkon> :/
[01:34] <natural> yes thank you kostkon i have some exp with compiiz, i just wanted to know if there was another way, because xfce mint 15 had it through panel szettings
[01:34] <qin> tjbiddle: hm?
[01:35] <tjbiddle> qin: Can I give an example using AWS route 53 and you'd understand that?
[01:35] <kostkon> natural, for what you are asking, no. some things can be done with unity-tweak or ubuntu-tweak. the will change some compiz confs for you
[01:35] <tjbiddle> Not experienced enough with dns to know how much translates to other solutions
[01:36] <kostkon> they*
[01:36] <natural> so this ccsm wont let me make inactive windows transpafrent?
[01:37] <qin> tjbiddle: rather would not get it, but #dns looks tempting
[01:37] <somsip> tjbiddle: because you add domains to your domain registrar so the entries get propogated out to other nameservers.
[01:37] <kostkon> natural, if there is such an option, then yes
[01:37] <kostkon> natural, plugin and/or plugin option whatever
[01:37] <natural> kostkon, if the xfce was able to do it through the panel, don't you think this sort of feature would be a simple thing?
[01:38] <kostkon> natural, im assuming xfce has it's own compositor
[01:38] <natural> idk, i know xfce mint comes from ubuntu, but maybe kubuntu or xubuntu, not sure
[01:39] <natural> it isnt gimp, it is the gui not debian, gnu, yeah gnu
[01:39] <kostkon> natural, but, enjoy it will it lasts, ubuntu is getting rid of compiz
[01:39] <natural> unity is not like gnu right? those are the two destops? gnu and unity?
[01:39] <kostkon> while*
[01:39] <tjbiddle> qin: I'll pop over there.
[01:39] <natural> that's ok, i never liked compiz so much anyway, i like having new software, i mean, i can't wait to see what they will desing next
[01:39] <kostkon> natural, unity is gnome3 with some other elements, like compiz and nux or whatever is called
[01:39] <tjbiddle> somsip: Still confused. AWS Route53 generates virtual nameservers - I added those into my /etc/resolv.conf and then added a record set into route 53 but it never resolved.
[01:40] <tjbiddle> Waited 30+ minutes as well.
[01:40] <natural> gnome
[01:40] <natural> thanks
[01:40] <natural> not gnu
[01:40] <natural> gnome
[01:40] <FloodBot1> natural: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[01:40] <natural> damn i got a bit excited, it is thunderingher something feirce
[01:40] <qin> natural: gnu is not a unix, unity is ethier state if unification or ubuntu wm
[01:40] <natural> i thnk someone might undestand how i might remember gnome as gnu
[01:41] <somsip> tjbiddle: you don't add those to your resolve. You just resolv as normal, but you need to wait for Route53 changes to propagate out to the nameserver you use. Whicj mostly depends on TTL
[01:42] <natural> when is the no-compiz ubuntu comming out?
[01:42] <qin> natural: it is caller ubuntu-server for example
[01:42] <kostkon> natural, officially, maybe oct 2014, that's unity 8
[01:42] <natural> cool
[01:42] <natural> but thats a while from now
[01:42] <natural> wow
[01:42] <qin> natural: of sorry, you ment mir think
[01:43] <natural> mircat
[01:43] <natural> ?
[01:43] <Ari-Yang> "no compiz ubuntu" is mir? :|
[01:43] <natural> idk
[01:43] <qin> Ari-Yang: not sure
[01:43] <kostkon> no compiz is qt5 based unity sitting on mir
[01:43] <Ari-Yang> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_%28software%29
[01:43] <natural> what is mir?
[01:44] <Ari-Yang> natural, check wikipedia
[01:44] <Ari-Yang> ubuntu 13.10 I think will have it
[01:44] <Ari-Yang> and possibly 14.04 LTS?
[01:44] <tjbiddle> somsip: So is adding a `nameserver some_ip_or_host_here` line in your /etc/resolv.conf not have the same meaning as adding one to your domain registrar? Naming conventions there are misleading then?
[01:45] <somsip> tjbiddle: does your resolv.conf have a line that says "#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN" ?
[01:45] <MocoacArting> won't MIR cause more fragmentation ?
[01:45] <qin> haha
[01:45] <natural> mir sounfds coo
[01:45] <tjbiddle> somsip: Yup. I edited /etc/resolvconf/conf.d/head and then ran `resolvconf -u` to update.
[01:45] <tjbiddle> somsip: Albeit, I believe if you edit /etc/resolv.conf manually - it's fine and will update right away - it just gets overwritten if you reboot
[01:46] <qin> MocoacArting: What's fragmentation?
[01:46] <tjbiddle> That's what it seemed to do through my experimentation at least
[01:46] <MocoacArting> waste effort and time on another project while everyone works on something else.
[01:46] <vicsar> .
[01:47] <somsip> tjbiddle: fair enough. I've never used Route53 virtual nameservers in the way you're wanting to, so it's difficult to see why you want to do this. SO i'm not sure i can help further
[01:47] <tjbiddle> somsip: Just wanted to test locally as I don't have access to the domain registrar and wanted to move forward on this project without having to wait for my client to get back with me and update it (If that was even necessary)
[01:49] <somsip> tjbiddle: I see. AFAIK, the domain registrar needs to be updated to point at the AWS nameservers. But I can't say I've ever tried anything different. Maybe #dns is the bes tplace after all
[01:50] <MocoacArting> how do verify ubuntu packages that i download from packages.ubuntu.com ?
[01:50] <wilee-nilee> MocoacArting, They come from the repos, do you mean a sum?
[01:51] <wilee-nilee> verify what?
[01:51] <MocoacArting> well aptitude auto verifies the package with the signed key
[01:52] <fancyfetus> Hi guys
[01:52] <wilee-nilee> Never heard of a problem withe the repos, I would not bother with aptitude personally
[01:52] <qin> MocoacArting: compare "local" mdsum with listed i.e. http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/raring/fonts-arabeyes
[01:52] <fancyfetus> I am using Universal USB installer to install ubuntu 13.04 onto my 4 GB fat32 formatted USB drive.
[01:52] <qin> MocoacArting: MD5 checksum
[01:53] <fancyfetus> When trying to boot to the drive, i just get a black screen with a blinking cursor in the top left.
[01:53] <wilee-nilee> !nomodeset | fancyfetus
[01:53] <ubottu> fancyfetus: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[01:53] <MocoacArting> but if im using dpkg it doesn't verify it with the signed key. so how do i verify it.
[01:53] <MocoacArting> umm but there is no Md5sum listed
[01:54] <MocoacArting> or is it that listed in the gpg.releases ?
[01:55] <ChogyDan> MocoacArting: you might be able to just run debsums .deb
[01:57] <ChogyDan> MocoacArting: I think many packages have included md5 sums, and that will just run a check on the deb vs those md5s
[01:58]  * wilee-nilee looks for his tinfoil fez
[01:59] <fancyfetus> wilee-nilee, I'm currently using Windows, but I plan on replacing it with Ubuntu. Is there any way to set nomodeset without first getting into ubuntu?
[01:59] <MocoacArting> umm but is there no way to verify downloaded deb packages with the signed ubuntu key ?
[01:59] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, from the grub menu on a partitioned install or f6 on a live cd, is this a wuni situation?
[01:59] <wilee-nilee> wubi*
[02:00] <fancyfetus> It's a wubi installation, I believe.
[02:00] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, Wubi is inside windows as a file if you remove windows wubi is gone. It is also a tryout setup, I would dual boot in the end.
[02:01] <fancyfetus> I installed the 13.04 iso file and am using Universal USB Installer to put it onto my usb drive.
[02:01] <gfallbackjcbv> isnt lts the best way to go so u dont get caught with your pants down
[02:01] <Dr_Willis> you installed the iso then are installing it again?
[02:02] <Dr_Willis> gfallbackjcbv:  i rarely use LTS. I like testing the new features
[02:02] <Dr_Willis> gfallbackjcbv:  it all depends on you rneeds
[02:02] <fancyfetus> sorry. I downloaded the 13.04 iso file
[02:02] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  ;)
[02:02] <Dr_Willis> that makes more sence. heh.
[02:02] <qin> MocoacArting: my bad with source link, here is deb of moc (best player ever) with md5checksum at the bottom
[02:02] <gfallbackjcbv> whats the point of having a nother hd has home folder
[02:02] <kostkon> !info moc
[02:02] <ubottu> moc (source: moc): ncurses based console audio player. In component universe, is optional. Version 1:2.5.0~alpha4+svn20120224-1ubuntu1 (raring), package size 244 kB, installed size 680 kB
[02:02] <fancyfetus> after universal usb installer does its thing, wubi.exe is on the usb. So is that a wubi install or a liveCD install?
[02:03] <Dr_Willis> gfallbackjcbv:  makes reinstalling a lot easier.. lets me keep all my users stuff on my SPeedy SSD hard drive... lets me put other users on the slow 3TB hd..
[02:03] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, wubi is not on the 13.04 iso, it wopuld be a partitioned install a live enviroment.
[02:03] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  wubi.exe is a tool you can run from within windows to do a wubi install., I would FORGET wubi even exists
[02:03] <wilee-nilee> on the usb it is live
[02:04] <Dr_Willis> the fact theres a wubi.exe means that theres just the wubi installer ON the usb. :)
[02:04] <Dr_Willis> Best wubi advice.. is forget wubi ever existed.
[02:04] <wilee-nilee> +1
[02:05] <gfallbackjcbv> actualy wubi is good cause it keeps u from getting caught up in the linux mess
[02:05] <Dr_Willis> wubi is a disaster..
[02:05] <MocoacArting> qin, im just wondering how apt-get and aptitude verify packages
[02:06] <Dr_Willis> if you want to test out a linux without partioning - use virtualbox
[02:06] <wilee-nilee> hallelujah
[02:06] <Dr_Willis> or a live-usb, or do a full install to a usb
[02:09] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, It sounded like you want to run ubuntu as your main OS eventually, we can help you do a regular partitioned install if you like
[02:10] <JaredFTW> Hello everyone
[02:11] <fancyfetus> wilee-nilee, Yes, I'd like to install ubuntu as my main os
[02:11] <JaredFTW> So I have a problem
[02:12] <JaredFTW> I'm trying to set OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime as the default application for opening .jar files, but when I go into Properties, then go into Open With, OpenJDK isn't there.
[02:12] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, Cool, I would dualboot it to start with is all, I use windows on occasion myself, even though I started with open source.
[02:12] <JaredFTW> Hm...
=== LoganG is now known as LoganG|off
[02:13] <fancyfetus> wilee-nilee, I'm trying to force myself to adapt completely to linux. I've installed it and used it before using wubi, but would like to make the full leap now.
[02:13] <JaredFTW> Well, it looks like you should install Linux, but when it says if you want to overwrite Windows 7, select the option that allows you to dual-boot
[02:14] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, Cool, well just ask what you need to.
[02:14] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  be sure you got a rescue-recovery dvd set made - just in case you ever need windows back.
[02:15] <JaredFTW> So...does anyone know what problem I sent in, or are you all too busy?
[02:15] <Dr_Willis> like if you sell or give away the pc.
[02:15] <fancyfetus> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop is this where I should download ubuntu 13.04?
[02:15] <Dr_Willis> JaredFTW:  id have to suggest checking askubuntu.com to see how it should be done.
[02:15] <JaredFTW> The entire point of this IRC channel is for ubuntu help
[02:15] <ChogyDan> JaredFTW: there is some sort of command line tool to do the job, but I end up just removing the other versions of java
[02:16] <fancyfetus> I have the cd's already made. Though I don't exactly have a legitimate  copy of windows 8 installed, I have my original windows 7 disks.
=== bill is now known as Guest23045
[02:16] <JaredFTW> Well I need to make it the default application for .jar files, I don't want to make a .sh script everytime I install blah.jar and blargh.jar

[02:24] <Nothing_Much> Anybody know how to get rEFInd on a 2006 32 bit white iMac for Ubuntu?
[02:25] <dhyana> Nothing_Much:  try #macosx
[02:25] <Nothing_Much> Thanks
[02:25] <dhyana> ok
[02:25] <wilee-nilee> Nothing_Much, Not sure ubuntu is going to run on that.
[02:26] <wilee-nilee> very well anyway
[02:26] <Clank|Tab> So im deciding if ill switch to linux or not
[02:26] <Dr_Willis> that is a Intel cpu imac and not a ppc one? i hope. ;)
[02:26] <Nothing_Much> wilee-nilee, I'm actually using Lubuntu and tried Fedora, but the problem stems from attempting to get rid of the ? mark folder to boot up the Mac faster
[02:26] <fancyfetus> wilee-nilee, so where exactly should I get the image that i need to install to my usb? The ubuntu website gets harder and harder to navigate every time i visit it.
[02:26] <wilee-nilee> I was thinking lubuntu
[02:27] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, You want what release 12.04 longterm or 13.o4 not supported for more than 4 more months?
[02:27] <mgaray> Hi im new, who can i talk to for help installing flash player
[02:27] <Dr_Willis> !torrents
[02:27] <ubottu> Raring can be torrented from http://torrent.ubuntu.com/simple/raring/desktop/ubuntu-13.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent or http://torrent.ubuntu.com/simple/raring/server/ubuntu-13.04-server-amd64.iso.torrent depending on your needs. Other flavors can be found at http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969
[02:28] <sordidbass> not a fan of 13.04
[02:28] <fancyfetus> why is 13.04 not supported for more than 4 months?
[02:28] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  what one are you looking for?
[02:28] <sordidbass> 12.04.3 is better
[02:28] <wilee-nilee> mgaray, Install the ubuntu-restricted-extras get flash other codecs and ms fonts.
[02:28] <Dr_Willis> !13.04
[02:28] <ubottu> Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) is the current release of Ubuntu. Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/13.04/ - Release notes: http://ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/13.04
[02:28] <mgaray> I need help installing flash player
[02:28] <Dr_Willis> ubuntu has Long term support versions - if you want to not need to reinstall/upgrade  so often
[02:29] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, support was moved to 9 months on it is all not 18
=== LoganG is now known as LoganG|off
[02:29] <fancyfetus> Why is 12.04 the more liked one?
[02:29] <mgaray> guys help
[02:29] <wilee-nilee> mgaray, I just did.
[02:29] <Dr_Willis>  fancyfetus  12.04 is the latest LTS release
[02:29] <sordidbass> nice thing about the latest LTS 12.04.3 is that it includes the latest updates in X.org and a the 13.04 kernel but offeres the support of an LTS release
[02:29] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  it all depends on your needs
[02:29] <mgaray> oh wow didnt see u, but ive done that so many times and it hasnt worked
[02:30] <compdoc> LTS 12.04.3 works well
[02:30] <fancyfetus> LTS = Long Term Service?
[02:30] <Dr_Willis> !lts
[02:30] <ubottu> LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; with the exception of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), which will be supported for 5 years on the desktop. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04)
[02:30] <ChogyDan> fancyfetus: :)
[02:30] <wilee-nilee> mgaray, you have the partner and backport repos open?
[02:30] <fancyfetus> ahh, I see. I can upgrade if i want to from inside ubuntu, right?
[02:30] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  of course.
[02:30] <mgaray> how would i do that? I just installed ubuntu finally on my chromebook today
[02:31] <fancyfetus> okay, 12.04 LTS it is!
[02:31] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  if you have a cutting-edge new laptop - then a newer release may be a better idea.
[02:31] <wilee-nilee> mgaray, run  software-properties-gtk and look that they are ticked
[02:31] <fancyfetus> Dr_Willis, nope, 2 years old now.
[02:31] <mgaray> how do i run that, in terminal?
[02:32] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  run whatever you want then.
[02:32] <wilee-nilee> mgaray, Make sure they are then run sudo apt-get upgrade ; sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
[02:32] <wilee-nilee> mgaray, yes run means the terminal in general
[02:32] <fancyfetus> So I just download ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso and install it to my flash drive?
[02:32] <fancyfetus> then boot it?
[02:32] <wilee-nilee> yep
[02:33] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  you use a proper tool to put iton the USB.  dont just copy the iso to the usb
[02:33] <wilee-nilee> ^^^^
[02:33] <fancyfetus> I did that with 13.04 and got the whole black screen thing. Yeah, I used Universal USB Installer.
[02:33] <mgaray> yea they are ticked
[02:33] <Dr_Willis> !nomodeset | fancyfetus
[02:33] <ubottu> fancyfetus: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[02:33] <kostkon> mgaray, flash is not available on arm cpus
[02:33] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, There is a nomodeset option for black screens
[02:33] <mgaray> they are ticked
[02:33] <Dr_Willis> mgaray:  no flash for arm.
[02:33] <wilee-nilee> ah, my bad
[02:34] <Dr_Willis> well unless you are running android. ;)
[02:34] <fancyfetus> wilee-nilee, but how would i set it if I can't even get install or access linux?
[02:34] <mgaray> oh so it doesnt work on samsung series 3
[02:34] <johnca|home> hello, What's a good way to keep /etc/ or other config type files in a repo and then put them in place after cloning a repo?
[02:34] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, You can with nomodeset likely, read the bots link.
[02:34] <Dr_Willis> mgaray:  its possibld google-chrome Might have some arm flash - but ive never really noticed.
[02:34] <kostkon> Dr_Willis, neither. it's been removed
[02:35] <Dr_Willis> kostkon:  I got itgoing on my android. ;) unofficially of course.
[02:35] <kostkon> Dr_Willis, yeah, old unsupported version
[02:35] <Dr_Willis> there are flash-downloader extensions and play-flash-in-mplayer or vlc
[02:35] <JaredFTW> I'm pretty sure Ubottu is a bot
[02:35] <Dr_Willis> kostkon:  like they even had 'support' when they were new and supported. ;)
[02:35] <kostkon> mgaray, you are on an arm platform you should think accordingly. no steam, no flash, no most of games etc
[02:36] <wilee-nilee> JaredFTW, yes she is
[02:36] <kostkon> Dr_Willis, indeed
[02:36] <mgaray> alright, well thank you for telling me so i dont waste anymore time
[02:36] <fancyfetus> I changed the MBR of my USB drive
[02:36] <JaredFTW> Wait, wait, wait, wait, no steam on a ARM platform?
[02:36] <fancyfetus> let me try 13.04 again.
[02:36] <fancyfetus> I'll brb
[02:36] <mgaray> but is there a way to watch youtube at all on arm?
[02:36] <kostkon> mgaray, yes
[02:37] <mgaray> how
[02:37] <kostkon> mgaray, enable html5 youtube.com/html5
=== boeyc is now known as livelaughlearn
[02:37] <JaredFTW> So, wilee-nilee, Ubottu is actually a woman.
[02:37] <JaredFTW> OKAY!
[02:37] <mgaray> i tried that, but when it gives me to option to use the extension on a video it doesnt do anything
[02:37] <JaredFTW> GOT IT!
[02:37] <wilee-nilee> JaredFTW, Thats the general consensus with bots. ;)
[02:37] <dhyana> hi ubottu
=== dziegler_off is now known as dziegler
[02:38] <JaredFTW> Hm...That's sexist
[02:38] <kostkon> mgaray, what extension?
[02:38] <JaredFTW> Bots are usually called women
[02:38] <mgaray> html5, im in the trial already
[02:38] <Dr_Willis> Ubotu is a FemBot ;P
[02:38] <kostkon> mgaray, what happens when you try to watch a vid
[02:39] <wilee-nilee> okay the bots a hermaphrodite
[02:39] <kostkon> mgaray, what browser?
[02:39] <Dr_Willis> wilee-nilee:  oh my... ;P
[02:39] <mgaray> chromium
[02:39] <wilee-nilee> still a diva
[02:40] <mgaray> would it work if i got it from chrome store
[02:40] <kostkon> mgaray, hmm ok. better change to chrome, if there is an arm ver for it, or firefox. chromium might be missing codecs needs some further setup
[02:41] <kostkon> or*
[02:41] <mgaray> how do i install chrome on arm?
[02:41] <Dr_Feelgud> hello guys is ther any terminal base monitoring tool for ubuntu?
[02:41] <JaredFTW> Dunno
[02:41] <sacrelicious> hey guys, just installed a fresh install of ubuntu on a new machine
[02:41] <sacrelicious> any idea why i'm not getting any sound?
[02:41] <qin> Dr_Feelgud: top?
[02:41] <JaredFTW> Have you rebooted?
[02:41] <JaredFTW> Just kidding.
[02:41] <sacrelicious> for some reason, my only output device is "dummy output"
[02:41] <kostkon> mgaray, actually, is this package already installed? is it available actually: chromium-codecs-ffmpeg
[02:41] <wilee-nilee> sacrelicious, applauds the install. ;)
[02:41] <JaredFTW> Hm...
[02:41] <sacrelicious> wilee-nilee, ha, thanks.
[02:42] <mgaray> how do i check?
[02:42] <JaredFTW> Are you using a desktop or laptop?
[02:42] <kostkon> mgaray, a quick way, is in the terminal:  apt-cache policy chromium-codecs-ffmpeg
[02:42] <Dr_Feelgud> qin i need a network monitoting tool that can run on terminal
[02:42] <qin> Dr_Feelgud: iftop
[02:42] <fancyfetus> Still nothing. I dont think that the nomodeset will work for me since i dont even have simple access to linux.
[02:43] <mgaray> installed
[02:43] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  you select nomodeset from the live cd boot up menus if you need to enable it
[02:43] <fancyfetus> It doesnt boot at all. It doesnt even try. It just black screens and the cursor flashes. The usb light doesnt flash to show that it is active.
[02:43] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  or if you make a live-usb - you can do it that way. or alter the startup files to make it the default
[02:44] <kostkon> mgaray, hmm ok. so what happens when you try to wach a video on youtube
[02:44] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  sounds like you got a bad iso/burn/image made on usb
[02:44] <JaredFTW> Alright, I have another problems
[02:44] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, You look at the nomodeset prompt by the bot?
[02:44] <JaredFTW> problme*
[02:44] <sacrelicious> anyone got ideas on my sound?

[02:44] <fancyfetus> wilee-nilee, yes
[02:44] <JaredFTW> Can I use the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connecter with Linux?

[02:45] <mgaray> i have an adobe 11.3 installed, by putting lipepflashplayer.so in chromium
[02:45] <fancyfetus> And Dr_Willis, its possible. Ill have to redownload the iso. I installed it onto the uab multiple times.
[02:45] <fancyfetus> Usb**
[02:45] <kostkon> mgaray, hmm. arm version of that .so?
[02:45] <Dr_Willis> JaredFTW:  try it and see? I got one i was going to try last week - but cant find it. ;)  oh wait. Mine is a USB->wired ;)
[02:45] <mgaray> whoa, it plays on fiirefox
[02:46] <kostkon> mgaray, ;)
[02:46] <JaredFTW> I'm  using a Wireless one
[02:46] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, Are you getting the try or install or check the memory gui on the usb boot?
[02:46] <kostkon> mgaray, better remove the .so file, it could be the cause of the problem in chromium
[02:46] <Dr_Willis> fancyfetus:  this is why i use torrents.  they tend to self-verify better. ;)
[02:46] <sordidbass> i'm quite surprised the Pipelight plugin actually works
[02:46] <mgaray> how do i remove it, it wont move to trash or anything
[02:46] <JaredFTW> Never mind, it's useles..
[02:46] <JaredFTW> useless..*
[02:47] <JaredFTW> you can use it with most router
[02:47] <JaredFTW> routers*
[02:47] <fancyfetus> Dr_Willia, ill do that this time. wilee-nilee, nope. I get nothing at all. Straight from bios to black screen.
=== dziegler is now known as dziegler_off
[02:47] <mgaray> kost how do i remove .so
[02:47] <JaredFTW> Dr_Willia, you use what?
[02:47] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, Cool just wanted to confirm that on he ubuntu website are alternative downloads to get to a torrent.
[02:47] <wilee-nilee> the*
[02:48] <kostkon> mgaray, how did you put it there? if you gave a command like this sudo cp file path_to_chromium_folder, then just give sudo rm path_to_chromium_folder/file
[02:48] <Dr_Willis> !torrents
[02:48] <ubottu> Raring can be torrented from http://torrent.ubuntu.com/simple/raring/desktop/ubuntu-13.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent or http://torrent.ubuntu.com/simple/raring/server/ubuntu-13.04-server-amd64.iso.torrent depending on your needs. Other flavors can be found at http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969
[02:48] <JaredFTW> Also, Dr_Willia, the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connecter is useless anyways
[02:48] <mgaray> oh, i think it was something like that. sudo in place of cp its rm?
[02:48] <cathryn> hey gang, i recently installed Lubuntu 13.04 for my sister and there's just one problem.  i can't seem to find the VGA settings under "Monitor Settings".  I installed Lubuntu for her in the past and i remember there was a tab for VGA settings.  will they show up after i plug a VGA cable in?
[02:48] <fancyfetus> Torrenting it now, ill let you guys know how it gows.
[02:48] <fancyfetus> Goes*
[02:48] <wilee-nilee> cool
[02:48] <kostkon> mgaray, and combine the filename with the path
[02:49] <qin> mgaray: history | grep so
[02:50] <fancyfetus> My new internet setup doesnt like torrents though, so this may take a while.
[02:50] <mgaray> ok i removed it
[02:50] <kostkon> mgaray, restart chromium and check
[02:52] <mgaray> alright, no shockwave plugin it say. html5 i removed earlier which i got from chrome store, do i get that back again?
[02:52] <reisio> chrome store?
[02:52] <kostkon> mgaray, i dont know what that is. but if you think ti is needed, get it again
[02:52] <kostkon> mgaray, firefox is always a good fallback option
[02:53] <livelaughlearn> kostkon, after i downloaded the usb to html driver, something crashed and i couldnt get into gui mode, now  i have a messed up second monitor using a fraction of the screen. please advise
[02:53] <reisio> mgaray: there's a VLC plugin that will take any youtube video and play it in place
[02:53] <livelaughlearn> kostkon, it cant detect my monitor but it displays it
[02:53] <reisio> youtube-viewer would probably be better, but less orthodox
[02:53] <mgaray> alright, i got html5 extension for chromium and when i click the 5 under video it doesnt play
[02:54] <kostkon> livelaughlearn, is the 1st monitor working ok?
[02:54] <cathryn> can anyone help me with a vga cable problem?
[02:54] <livelaughlearn> kostkon, the main laptop one, yes
[02:54] <reisio> cathryn: no, but some people probably could
[02:55] <kostkon> livelaughlearn, you could remove the package. did you create a xorg conf file after installing the package?
[02:55] <mgaray> html5 doesnt play video, it gives the option to use it but it doesnt play it
[02:55] <livelaughlearn> i tried but it did not let me save
[02:56] <livelaughlearn> it did detect my display (green screen) for the usb to hdmi
[02:56] <kostkon> livelaughlearn, and then?
[02:56] <livelaughlearn> but now everything is messed up
=== yc|BAL is now known as yc|
[02:56] <livelaughlearn> it wasnt consistent any more
[02:56] <kostkon> livelaughlearn, so both monitors are messed up now
[02:56] <mgaray> html5 help
[02:57] <livelaughlearn> it would only detect one at a time, and i couldnt fix the green
[02:58] <kostkon> livelaughlearn, did you try to setup your external monitor(s) in system settings?
[02:58] <livelaughlearn> kostkon, it cannot detect my direct hdmi montior in settings, but it does display in a smaller area of the monitor
[02:59] <mgaray> kost nvm firefox doesnt play either it just played a video on youtube page then when i searched one it didnt work
[02:59] <Dr_Willis>  mgaray  for firefox and youtube. i tend to use the flash downloader extensions and just download the video in mp4  format
[02:59] <kostkon> mgaray, some play some not. you wont get 100% of the vids to play with html5
[02:59] <Dr_Willis> not all youtube videos have html5 versions
[02:59] <mgaray> oh ok
[03:00] <kostkon> livelaughlearn, you could try to remove the pacakge or create a xorg file
[03:00] <elfer> youtube-dl works good
[03:00] <mgaray> so how would i view the videos that dont have html5 support
[03:00] <elfer> work's great
[03:00] <livelaughlearn> kostkon, how do i do that i did sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core first
[03:00] <Dr_Willis> mgaray:  download them and watch them
[03:00] <kostkon> mgaray, download them then converted them to some other format
[03:00] <livelaughlearn> kostkon thank you i am learning
[03:00] <mgaray> ok so i get flash downloader and how do i download video
[03:00] <Dr_Willis> you most likely dont need to convert. :) vlc and other players can play .flv
[03:01] <Dr_Willis> mgaray:  the ff extsnsion adds a download button to the web page.
[03:02] <kostkon> livelaughlearn, sudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-displaylink?
[03:02] <mgaray> so how do i get the extension and does minitube work
[03:03] <Dr_Willis> mgaray:  go to the firefox extension site and look for one
[03:03] <Dr_Willis> http://www.flashvideodownloader.org/helpfirefox.php  is what i use
[03:04] <livelaughlearn> kostkon, not working
[03:04] <livelaughlearn> kostkon, any other suggestions?
[03:04] <kostkon> livelaughlearn, what do you mean? actually what ubuntu version have oyu got?
[03:05] <kostkon> livelaughlearn, previously i assumed you had 12.04
[03:05] <livelaughlearn> kostkon, oh i have 12.04 and i uninstalled but nothing has improved
[03:05] <kostkon> livelaughlearn, you need to reboot
[03:06] <hero100> sometimes okular will become blank and normal again in one second. what's the problem?
[03:06] <livelaughlearn> kostkon, ok thanks
[03:11] <vmussa> hello, I just bought a new notebook with a small SSD (24gb), and would like to ask if it would be wise to install ubuntu on the HDD
[03:11] <Dr_Willis> 24gb? thats tiny.
[03:11] <Dr_Willis> but its doable
[03:11] <vmussa> yes
[03:11] <vmussa> its an ultra book
[03:11] <vmussa> haha
=== xin_ is now known as zhangchao
[03:11] <Dr_Willis> ive ran ubuntu from a 8gb usb flash. :) 16 worked better.. 32 worked great
[03:12] <vmussa> oh I see
[03:12] <Dr_Willis> you might want to stick to Lubuntu or Xbuntu if the specs are low end on that pc
[03:13] <vmussa> but since I'm a newbie I think it would be better if I installed it in the HDD
[03:14] <vmussa> oh I didnt know about theese two distros
[03:15] <vmussa> but as I said I'm kind of a newbie, and Ubuntu's community being the biggest one in Linux world makes me more confortable

[03:17] <desaints> Hello, I'm trying to create a hard link of a txt file in a new directory under a new name I want lisaRA.txt to hard link to ls1.txt in ~/D1 I'm stumped on how to do this..
[03:17] <desaints> I tried... ln -t lisaRA.txt ls1.txt ~/D1
[03:18] <vmussa> so all instalation process of things would be the same for ubuntu and Lubuntu and Xubuntu?
[03:18] <SwedeMike> desaints: give full path+filename in one argument.
[03:18] <Dr_Willis> the desktop is differt vmussa  - lxde and xfce are more classic old skool looking.
[03:18] <Dr_Willis> you may want to try out xubuntu first. if its to sluggish - try lubuntu
[03:19] <desaints> swedemike ln -t lisaRA.txt ~/D1/ls1.txt
[03:19] <hero100> i'm confused with the description in man page for ln. I use $(pwd)foo most of the time
[03:19] <bubbless> Xubuntu is better.
[03:19] <SwedeMike> desaints: so stand in the dir you want to create it, link to fullpath+filename and then just the filename you want in the current dir. otherwise give full path+filename
[03:19] <SwedeMike> desaints: skit -t
[03:19] <SwedeMike> skip
[03:19] <desaints> SwedeMike Ahhh gotcha
[03:20] <dhyana> 'night
[03:20] <SwedeMike> desaints: what error do you get?
[03:21] <desaints> ln ~/lisaRA.txt ls1.txt worked just fine
[03:21] <vmussa> Dr_Willis, I will look at theese options then!
[03:21] <smw94> is there any chance to update python 2.7.4 default to python 3.3 on raring ?
[03:22] <SwedeMike> smw94: http://linuxg.net/how-to-install-python-3-3-on-ubuntu-13-04-12-10-and-12-04/
[03:22] <desaints> SwedeMike if i wanted to do a softlink would i just add the argument -softlink?
[03:22] <SwedeMike> desaints: -s yes
=== bill is now known as Bill_
[03:22] <SwedeMike> desaints: or --softlink
[03:23] <vmussa> Dr_Willis, so there is a equivalent version of Xubuntu for every Ubuntu? I mean, if I want ubuntu 12.04, then I can install Xubuntu 12.04 so that everything will be exactly the same except for the user interface?

[03:27] <wilee-nilee> Bill_, Can you say why those are not acceptable?
[03:27] <Bill_> Im getting alot of screen freez ups with both
[03:27] <Bill_> chrome mainly
[03:28] <wilee-nilee> Bill_, Could it be your hardware and the desktop you are running?
[03:28] <kostkon> it's flash, it's always flash
[03:28] <kostkon> Bill_, flashblock and/or adblock
[03:29] <Bill_> using 12.04 ubuntu
[03:29] <Bill_> laptop
[03:29] <Bill_> adblock
[03:29] <kostkon> Bill_, already using it?
[03:29] <Bill_> hmm wonder if thats causing it
[03:29] <kostkon> Bill_, replace it with flashblock and see
[03:30] <wilee-nilee> Bill_, what is the chip and ram amount?
[03:30] <Bill_> ok i'll try that
[03:30] <Bill_> i have a i3  4g of ram
[03:30] <al_la> quick question ... is there a way to list user installed packages instead of all installed packages?  for instance, 'dpkg --get-selections' lists all including dependencies, wherein it won't differentiate.
[03:30] <wilee-nilee> Bill_, Have you run htop to check what is running?
[03:31] <Bill_> i haven't
[03:31] <Bill_> i'll try that to
[03:32] <wilee-nilee> Bill_, I use flash blocking myself, but sounds like you have something eating the cpu and or ram maybe.
[03:32] <Bill_> ok i'll run my monitor an check it out
[03:37] <Dr_Feelgud> hello guys i need a termninal based  networking monitoring tool that shows all your  connections
[03:40] <UmbraChimera> So, I need some help!
[03:41] <spydon> UmbraChimera: ask your question instead, nobody can help you just with the knowledge that you need help.
[03:42] <al_la> quick question: how can I list *only* user installed packages?  'dpkg --get-selections' lists all including dependencies and base packages instead of just user elected.
[03:43] <UmbraChimera> This is true. It's just long-ish lol.  Installed Lubuntu on old laptop I'm trying to fix for a family friend, it has no working cd drive, bios cant boot usb. Got it all installed, and now after a crash while updating wifi driver the mouse (touchpad and a usb one) won't function.
[03:43] <UmbraChimera> advice?
[03:44] <reisio> al_la: uhhh
[03:44] <reisio> !duplicate
[03:44] <reisio> bah
[03:44] <reisio> !clone
[03:44] <ubottu> To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type <unconvertable> aptitude  --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/my-packages <unconvertable> , move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type <unconvertable> sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install <unconvertable> (this may cause problems with multiarch before 12.10) - See also !automate

[03:48] <Dr_Willis> UmbraChimera:  go to the console. unplug/plug  the mouse in. check dmesg messages at the end to see if its seen

[03:50] <fancyfetus> What other ones are there?
[03:50] <fancyfetus> Gnome, Unity, what else?
[03:50] <UmbraChimera> alrighty, so i can use that to reinstall, thats one good thing, as long as none of those steps require a mouse lol
[03:51] <spydon> al_la: maybe grep -w install /var/log/dpkg.log ?
[03:51] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, unity is on top of gnome 3 there is the gnome-shell, fallback, xubuntu, lubuntu.
[03:51] <UmbraChimera> ill try installing gpm, and what is the console command I need to use to show the mouse?
[03:51] <al_la> spydon: ooh that's the closest I've seen
[03:52] <wilee-nilee> fancyfetus, what version did you finally install 12.04?
[03:52] <UmbraChimera> Dr_Willis: I installed  oh shit i forgot the program now. d-something-tools, the config editor. something somewhere said it could be used to renable the mouse. but i dont know how to launch it from terminal
[03:53] <al_la> spydon: thank you
[03:53] <spydon> al_la: I think you will always get the dependencies showing too if they were installed afterwards
[03:53] <desaints> how would i go about creating a .tar.bz2 file of a directory i keep getting errors like socket ignored when i do "tar -cf /tmp/ceg2350nn.tar.bz2 ~/home/desaints"
[03:54] <al_la> spydon: yeah it looks like it included a couple dependencies, and also isn't listing some things installed through the software center

[03:58] <alastor__> i'm trying to install ubuntu alongside windows 8 on a notebook the same way I've done with windows 7 on my desktop... however, (after switching from UEFI to regular booting), i see the usual ubuntu install options and all but, at the point where I'm usually asked whether I want to install ubuntu alongside or replacing the original OS, it seems that ubuntu can't detect that there's already a win8 install underneath
[03:59] <alastor__> funny thing is that, if i run ubuntu live, i can see the windows stuff mounted as an "OS" partition
[03:59] <aeaglez> hi
[03:59] <alastor__> so ubuntu can see that there's a windows install in there
[03:59] <alastor__> any tips on how to proceed?
[03:59] <rypervenche> desaints: You can ignore that. It's just your cache.
[04:00] <aeaglez> can someone help me with something regarding ubuntus internet connection?
[04:00] <desaints> rypervenche so it correctly completed then?
[04:00] <rypervenche> desaints: Yes, a few files just weren't included, but you don't need those.
[04:00] <desaints> rypervenche good to know..
[04:01] <aeaglez> can anyone help me or should i go look elsewhere?
[04:01] <Dr_Willis> alastor__:  check your partion layout. IF theres 4 primary partions - it may confuse things.  and i suggest you make a dvd-restore disk set for windows befor tyring to install linux on it

[04:03] <aeaglez> Ok sorry. I have been having problems with ubuntu regarding internet connection, i have ubuntu 12.04 lts, i am fairly new to ubuntu, and my problem is that my internet connection constantly disconnects, about every 5 mins and fails to re-connect, but when i go on windows 8, it re connects fairly quick, and does not disconnect. I am downloading the 13.04 version of ubuntu as we speak, what could be the problem?
[04:04] <fancyfetus> I'm getting 0.5 MB/s now that's like... 500 times better than before!

[04:05] <wilee-nilee> aeaglez, This your wifi and how far are you away from the router if so?
[04:05] <fancyfetus> Now if only i can finally install ubuntu, this will be the night of my life :P
[04:05] <alastor__> Dr_Willis: if I run ubuntu as live cd, i can see 4 disks mounted : PBR Image, OS, WINRETOOLS, and DIAGS. Is this what you meant when you said "If there's 4 primary partitions" ?
[04:05] <aeaglez> Im about 6 feet away from my router.
[04:05] <aeaglez> in other words i have full bar strength
[04:05] <wilee-nilee> aeaglez, You know the wifif card?
[04:06] <zombi> snippets shortcuts in xubuntu dont work,
[04:06] <wilee-nilee> wifi*
[04:06] <zombi> why is that?????????
[04:06] <zombi> is a bug? or is my err?
[04:07] <Dr_Willis> alastor__:  dont get disks and partions confused. and yes - it does look lik eyou have 4 partions.   check 'gparted'  to see what it says. 'sudo blkid' may also show some info
[04:07] <UmbraChimera> Dr_Willis: You ever seen something like this happen before?
[04:08] <aeaglez> wilee-nilee, might you have an idea why this problem is occuring?
[04:08] <alastor__> Dr_Willis: after googling some on the web, it seems that the process is somewhat easier if it's an ubuntu 64 bit image disk... i was trying to install a 32 bit image... do you think this might be overly complicating things?
[04:08] <Dr_Willis> UmbraChimera:  every so often someone comes in here with a mouse not seen. Never seen a definitve fis

[04:08] <Dr_Willis> alastor__:  I basically only use 64bit - since all my pcs are 64bit ;)
[04:08] <wilee-nilee> aeaglez, Not sure run lspci in the terminal and identify the wifi hardware.
[04:10] <wilee-nilee> aeaglez, This is not an area I'm real proficient in, however these details can trigger others knowledge.
[04:10] <wilee-nilee> I'm not actually*
[04:11] <aeaglez> ok, much thanks i will attempt running my program on ubuntu i just have to tweak a few things around, i might have an idea to get it running. Thank you for your time though, i appreciate it.

[04:27] <wafflejock> not sure what the discussion is but just switched from Unity to KDE myself
[04:27] <SuperLag> learned to customize a couple things I thought I was stuck with
[04:27] <wafflejock> I liked unity but I didn't like not being able to customize
[04:28] <wafflejock> also just felt a bit like too much visual jazz was getting distracting...
[04:29] <SuperLag> wafflejock: yeah... I like Kate, a LOT. But is it worth installing 86 packages to have it here? no way. :/
[04:30] <wafflejock> if anyone out there knows anything about Asterisk/FreePBX and using Google Voice Motif recently please let me know... running into some troubles with a RasPBX setup that worked a few months ago
[04:30] <SuperLag> wafflejock: turns out it's possible to customize, but not always so easy
[04:30] <wafflejock> yeah I hear ya, I went from Ubuntu Unity -> mixed with KDE saw the ridiculous amount of depedencies I was loading and decided to wipe unity and go straight Kubuntu
[04:31] <zombi> in respect to kde y prefer xfce
[04:31] <zombi> xfce4 is quick
[04:31] <SuperLag> I just switched from that to Unity.
[04:31] <zombi> and is very configurable,
[04:31] <wafflejock> really haven't messed with XCFE is it old people friendly?
[04:31] <SuperLag> reisio: is there an Ubuntu package that I can install that will make me feel refreshed after only 3 hours of sleep? :(

[04:35] <SuperLag> in another #ubuntu* channel where there is 1/10 the number of people, I got told to go to -offtopic today.... and I thought it was absolutely LAME... because that channel doesn't have a lot of activity usually, anyways.

[04:38] <mojtaba> Hi, I am going to make a backup server in a domain with windows servers and windows clients. Could you please tell me from where should I start? (I prefer linux backup server)
[04:38] <wafflejock> wanted the edge should have paid for the edge *broke*
[04:38] <reisio> SuperLag: why?
[04:38] <reisio> mojtaba: um, install it? Done
[04:38] <crocket> wafflejock, NDIS drivers became obsolete because linux has progressed.
[04:39] <SuperLag> :D
[04:39] <mojtaba> reisio: Is there a special linux OS?
[04:39] <mojtaba> or can I use ubuntu server?
[04:39] <crocket> mojtaba, You have slackware, ArchLinux, gentoo, CentOS, and redhat.
[04:40] <mojtaba> How should I configure it to make backups automatically? (Is there any tutorial for that?)
[04:40] <crocket> Arch and gentoo can be brittle.
[04:40] <wafflejock> mojtaba: Linux is simply the Kernel, all the distributions use some form of the kernel
[04:40] <reisio> mojtaba: what sort of backups do you want?
[04:40] <reisio> mojtaba: 1:1? Cumulative?
[04:40] <reisio> crocket: ...
[04:40] <crocket> reisio, what is it?
[04:40] <mojtaba> reisio: cumulative
[04:40] <wafflejock> if you're new to Linux a Debian distribution like Ubuntu is probably good for you but it's packed with extras you probably don't need too
[04:41] <reisio> mojtaba: okay, rdiff-backup and cron should cover it all nicely, then
[04:41] <reisio> crocket: hrmm?
[04:41] <hallstein> hello, i'm having a problem with upgrading graphics driver on 12.04
[04:41] <crocket> reisio, You invoked me first.
[04:42] <reisio> crocket: you invoked me first
[04:42] <reisio> hallstein: what problem is that?
[04:42] <reisio> mojtaba: http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Rdiff-backup s/emerge -atv/sudo apt-get install/
[04:43] <hallstein> the standard nvidia driver that comes with the system works fine, but upgrading to 3.19 results in the system failing to boot completely
[04:43] <wafflejock> failing to boot as in no GUI or failing to boot as in no command prompt?
[04:45] <hallstein> hmm, i'm not sure what information is most useful to you guys but what i'm currently looking at is a long list of... services? that either start or stop.
[04:46] <hallstein> example: starting userspace bootsplash followed by a bracketed OK
[04:46] <wafflejock> crocket: any details about how the NDIS wrapper issue has been resolved?  does the kernel just include drivers for most wireless chipsets now?
[04:46] <reisio> hallstein: ordinary boot splash
[04:46] <reisio> hallstein: what comes after that
[04:46] <wafflejock> so after all that hallestein you end up with a login prompt a splash screen or you're just stuck seeing the OK FAIL list
[04:46] <hallstein> I see the OK fail list
[04:47] <hallstein> and there is one that appears to have failed, the 'fallback graphics devices'
[04:47] <wafflejock> what's the last thing on screen?
[04:47] <wafflejock> like last OK FAIL row?
[04:47] <wafflejock> it doesn't sound good from here FYI
=== dziegler is now known as dziegler_off
[04:47] <hallstein> the last two lines are: checking battery state OK and starting cups printing/spooler server OK
[04:48] <crocket> wafflejock, I don't know, but I guess more wireless cards are supported better than before.
[04:48] <fancyfetus> Hi guys. I ran into the same problem again.
[04:48] <fancyfetus> I press boot from USB in bios
[04:49] <fancyfetus> and i immediately get a black screen with a blinking cursor.
[04:49] <fancyfetus> The bios does recognize the USB as a bootable drive, but doesn't actually attempt to boot.
[04:49] <mojtaba> reisio: crocket: thanks
[04:49] <fancyfetus> I know this because the drive's light doesn't blink.
[04:50] <fancyfetus> I'm at a loss.
[04:50] <mojtaba> reisio: Can I use ubuntu server or is there any better distro for that?
[04:50] <fancyfetus> should i try booting from network or booting from dvd?
[04:50] <crocket> mojtaba, For what?
[04:50] <mojtaba> crocket: for backup over LAN
[04:52] <reisio> mojtaba: you can use any distro
[04:52] <reisio> mojtaba: if a distro has a "server" edition, that would probably be more appropriate, as it's essentially code for "no desktop"
[04:52] <reisio> mojtaba: as for rdiff-backup and cron, almost any ridiculously minimalist distro could manage that
[04:53] <reisio> mojtaba: in a Windows environment you might want a variety of software to help the system mesh, though, so don't go too crazy on minimalism :)
[04:53] <moneydouble> Anyone have any guides/links/tips/books on learning Linux, ubuntu specifically?
[04:53] <wafflejock> agree with resio, mojtaba any distro should do here
[04:54] <wafflejock> moneydouble it really depends on what you're looking to learn, general knowledge can be found on the ubuntu forums a lot of the time or simply by googling, in terms of books I've got a few but they mostly get out dated (good for fundamentals but not good to stay current)
[04:54] <wafflejock> moneydouble: what are you looking to learn about?
[04:55] <moneydouble> wafflejock: well server management basically
[04:55] <moneydouble> sys admin type stuff
[04:55] <UmbraChimera> so some adice/help?  Installed Lubuntu on old laptop I'm trying to fix for a family friend, it has no working cd drive, bios cant boot usb. Got it all installed, and now after a crash while updating wifi driver the mouse (touchpad and a usb one) won't function.
=== bid is now known as Guest40746
[04:56] <reisio> UmbraChimera: how'd you install it?
[04:56] <UmbraChimera> unetbootin, and it worked,
[04:56] <UmbraChimera> mouse even wored
[04:56] <UmbraChimera> *worked. until it crashed trying to update so wireless driver worked
[04:57] <reisio> hrmm, how does unetbootin help you install from not usb or cd?
[04:57] <hallstein> should i just wipe my drive and try 13.04 instead of 12.04? my problem has happened on a few occasions.
[04:57] <reisio> hallstein: which problem?
[04:57] <UmbraChimera> it makes a bootable on the C:/ dont need anything at all
[04:57] <hallstein> graphics driver results in operating system not booting, all i see is a OK/FAIL list.
[04:57] <hallstein> graphics driver update*
[04:57] <wafflejock> moneydouble: dunno about anything extremely authoritative honestly but I've been playing with t1.micro instances from AWS (free for the first year) and gives you a nice way to try things out on a "real" server if you need it and can't test things out in  virtual box otherwise, there's forums if you have specific questions like http://serverfault.com/
[04:57] <reisio> UmbraChimera: ah
[04:58] <reisio> UmbraChimera: make sure your update finished properly
[04:58] <UmbraChimera> already did all that
[04:58] <wafflejock> hallstein idk what to tell you honestly... if you have a NAS you can back up to you can use Clonezilla to take a snapshot of your system before installing the drivers so you can experiment some more, but hard to say what's going wrong or what will solve it
[04:58] <UmbraChimera> prior to mouse failire
[04:59] <hallstein> that's okay. i'll keep trying. thanks for the help.
[05:00] <wafflejock> moneydouble: are you looking to sys admin for web servers or some other type of setup? like backups or application servers... guess what I'm getting at is there's a ton of stuff you can learn about Linux and there's a ton of stuff you might be trying to do so giving any one resource probably isn't going to help you
[05:01] <wafflejock> hallstein: np sorry I don't have Ubuntu on my desktop with the Nvidia card so I can't really test any of the drivers right now.. just have my laptop with the lowly Intel graphics

[05:38] <wafflejock> fancyfetus yeah I think most of the time it's easiest to just burn the DVD there is this program called multiboot though that lets you setup a flash drive with GRUB and multiple systems which is pretty cool, think I may play with that again when I have some time

[05:50] <hellyeah> haha
[05:50] <hellyeah> ubuntu 13.04 is real fast btw
[05:50] <hellyeah> i like this fast os
[05:50] <ubuntu-gnome> oh yeah
[05:51] <ubuntu-gnome> installing 13.10 beta1 right now
[05:51] <hellyeah> 13.10 is on the way oh damn
[05:51] <wafflejock> don't do it step back from the ledge man
[05:51] <hellyeah> i just installed ubuntu 13.04 recently
[05:51] <ubuntu-gnome> anybody know what those 'http' processes are during install?
[05:51] <hellyeah> :D
[05:51] <ubuntu-gnome> vty'ed out into an irssi window
[05:52] <hellyeah> also in the web site i didnt see  ubuntu 13.10
[05:52] <ubuntu-gnome> but watching everything it's trying to do
[05:52] <gal> Hello, i am trying to run WebEx on Ubuntu 12.04 64bit, i have done some reading but i found mostly old posts saying its not supported and i need to download JDK from sun and 32 bit Firefox and so on... isnt there a better easier way to do it ?
[05:53] <ubuntu-gnome> gal: it's probably doable, but you'll have much better luck with 13.04 as a desktop OS (WebEx and Skype come to mind)
[05:54] <wafflejock> gal: just did a bit of googling not privvy on the topic but it seems 64bit and WebEx is a no go because of Java/Firefox 32-bit versions don't work out
[05:54] <gal> ok thanks you two :|
[05:55] <ubuntu-gnome> the best answer is not to use webex (I worked for Cisco, ugh), but it can be done.  I've avoided it like the plague since I left.
[05:55] <wafflejock> ubuntu-gnome you know anything about Asterisk?
[05:56] <gal> what other desktop sharing would you use for multi users conference ? (the only other option i know is Skype which is free)
[05:56] <gal> but i never did a multi users sharing session with skype
[05:56] <wafflejock> gal: I've been using hangouts which has been nice
[05:56] <wafflejock> gal: has built in screensharing

[05:56] <hellyeah> can you tell me any good games on ubuntu
[05:56] <wafflejock> works for everyone... as long as they can get the plugin installed, also some problems with laptops coming out of sleep mode
[05:57] <wafflejock> hellyeah: check out steam store
[05:57] <gal> wafflejock: will check that out, thanks
[05:57] <wafflejock> hellyeah: if you want something native check out supertux
[05:57] <wafflejock> gal: yeah to clarify I mean Google hangouts
[05:58] <gal> yeah... thats the first search ... obviously.. :)
[05:58] <wafflejock> gal: oh I mean it's a product by Google... damn google being a verb :)
[05:58] <hellyeah> supertux is pengnuen game isnt it?
[05:58] <wafflejock> hellyeah: yeah like mario
[05:59] <wafflejock> hellyeah: team fortress is good on steam, or kerbal space program is pretty fun
[05:59] <gal> wafflejock : yeah i understand, i searched it up in google and that was the first match.. ;) (and i guess its obvious since its by Google...)
[05:59] <hellyeah> i played that game like 7 years ago
[05:59] <wafflejock> gal: ah gotcha
[05:59] <wafflejock> hellyeah: it's still good :)
[05:59] <hellyeah> i dont have any idea about what steam is is it like stream
[06:00] <wafflejock> hellyeah: steam is a marketplace by the company Valve
[06:00] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:00] <hellyeah> are games free? :D
[06:00] <wafflejock> hellyeah: they're a huge platform for distributing games on Windows and OS X just came to Linux recently
[06:00] <wafflejock> hellyeah: not usually, some demos though
[06:00] <wafflejock> hellyeah: some free to play where you can buy stuff in game to "enhance the experience"
[06:00] <wafflejock> haha
[06:01] <hellyeah> hahaha
[06:01] <Kartagis> how do I change the language? it turned to Japanese and I can't read it
[06:01] <wafflejock> basically Steam is the reason for Windows Arcade on XBox and the marketplace on every other console though it's pretty big stuff and cool to have it come to Linux, still lots of Indie games only though
[06:01] <hellyeah> capitalism took over ubuntu may be :CD
[06:02] <hellyeah> indie games like what
[06:02] <wafflejock> Kartagis: what turned Japanese?
[06:02] <Kartagis> wafflejock: the whole OS
[06:02] <wafflejock> idk one minute I just installed kubuntu here so don't have steam

[08:05] <Psil0Cybin> hey guys i need help
[08:05] <Psil0Cybin> when ever i try and dowwnload large files
[08:05] <Psil0Cybin> my internet connection drops, while it says im still connected wifi
[08:06] <Psil0Cybin> on other computers the internet connection is fine, and using a live cd the internet connection is fine
[08:06] <Psil0Cybin> so it means something is hay wire on my machine but i dont want to format.
[08:06] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, first, stop thinking every error means "quick!  format the computer!"
[08:07] <Psil0Cybin> i dont just smoeone suggested that here last night if the live cd worked
[08:07] <Psil0Cybin> because i googled and googled and tried everything i found on the ubuntu forums
[08:07] <Psil0Cybin> but nothing fixed it for me
[08:07] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, depending on your network setup, it's possible that there's a setting somewhere to that is throttling your download pipeline
[08:08] <Psil0Cybin> how can i go about diagnosing it
[08:08] <Psil0Cybin> because it all started when i installed samba
[08:08] <Psil0Cybin> before that it was working amazing
[08:08] <reisio> how exactly are you comparing the connection on a live OS?
[08:08] <reisio> are you downloading the same file?
[08:08] <Psil0Cybin> yup
[08:08] <reisio> to the hard disk?
[08:08] <Psil0Cybin> on the live os i can download it to my USB
[08:08] <Psil0Cybin> although it takes years
[08:08] <reisio> years?
[08:08] <Psil0Cybin> but on my conection its fast but after 10 minutes it drops
[08:09] <reisio> maybe your hard disk is just incredibly slow
[08:09] <reisio> and your connection speed is nice and fast
[08:09] <Psil0Cybin> yea but prior to installing samba (which i was told would never cause this) it was working amazing
[08:09] <Psil0Cybin> and right now i can talk to you guys
[08:09] <reisio> ah, well
[08:09] <reisio> simple then
[08:09] <Psil0Cybin> but the second i try and download any big file
[08:09] <Psil0Cybin> it drops
[08:09] <cfhowlett> *years?*
[08:09] <Psil0Cybin> but!!!
[08:09] <reisio> undo whatever installing samba did
[08:09] <FloodBot1> Psil0Cybin: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:09] <Psil0Cybin> but if i tether my phone i can download the big file!! so i deleted all preferences for my Wifi
[08:10] <Psil0Cybin> and still nothing
[08:10] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, yeah, I'd agree with reisio.  samba is supsect.
[08:10] <cfhowlett> suspect
[08:10] <Psil0Cybin> so i know my wifi is working fine, i know my wifi card is working, i think maybe samba messed up my networking
[08:10] <Psil0Cybin> or something
[08:10] <Psil0Cybin> because it only happends on this specific network but other computers can download it file
[08:10] <Psil0Cybin> so its not my roater / modem even tho i power cycled.
[08:10] <Psil0Cybin> anyway
[08:11] <Psil0Cybin> if you google ubuntu internet drops
[08:11] <Psil0Cybin> there are plenty of posts but nothing helps me
[08:11] <Psil0Cybin> like its mind boggling cfhowlett its like, the forces of nature are against me
[08:11] <Psil0Cybin> my other ubuntu machine works perfectly fine on the same network
[08:12] <Psil0Cybin> maybe ill try changing my netork name
[08:12] <Psil0Cybin> i tried doing sudo apt-get remove samba
[08:13] <Psil0Cybin> and sudo apt-get purge samba
[08:14] <Psil0Cybin> i thought maybe it was a power management issue so i ran acouple of commands that someone posted on the forums like ifdown ...etc.etc, but that also did not fix anything
[08:14] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, sudo apt-get purge samba
[08:14] <wafflejock> Psil0Cybin: not sure if it will help but you can check out wireshark gives traces of all the packets on the network perhaps something suspect will pop up before the failure
[08:14] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, also, if you haven't done so recently, time to sudo apt-get update &&  sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[08:15] <Psil0Cybin> everything is upto date cfhowlett
[08:15] <Psil0Cybin> :( im so confused
[08:15] <Psil0Cybin> god damit >.<
[08:15] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, fair enough.  I say purge and rebuild samba ...
[08:15] <Psil0Cybin> i didnt think samba could cause such a mess.
[08:15] <Psil0Cybin> so sudo apt-get install samba?
[08:16] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, after purging, right
[08:16] <Psil0Cybin> yea okay
[08:16] <Psil0Cybin> okay
[08:16] <Psil0Cybin> installing
[08:17] <Psil0Cybin> like its wierd i notice that now i can talk to you guys and no dropping so its only with a big download and on this specific network (but other cmoputers can download big files off this network no problem)
[08:17] <Psil0Cybin> isnt that a head scratcher.
[08:17] <Psil0Cybin> okay samba installed lemme try downloading the file again
[08:17] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, as I said, somewhere there's a setting that limits downloadable files ...
[08:18] <Psil0Cybin> how would i go about finding that
[08:18] <Psil0Cybin> i am semi new to linux i guess you can obviously tell.
[08:18] <cfhowlett> Psil0Cybin, don't beat yourself up.  we all started as noobs.  As for where to look: no samba, no knowledge.  sorry
[08:19] <Psil0Cybin> its okay man
[08:19] <Psil0Cybin> im going to keep trying before i format
[08:19] <Psil0Cybin> thats how ill learn anyways ;)
[08:19] <wafflejock> Psil0Cybin: you can also check out netstat may be helpful as well to see what's running http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-network-troubleshooting-tips.html also not sure about details of samba though best of luck
[08:19] <Psil0Cybin> no problem thanks guys
[08:19] <Psil0Cybin> you are a very helpful bunch of people :0
[08:19] <gal> Hello if i have windows vm (my host is Ubuntu 12.04) using Vmware player, will i be able to share my Ubuntu desktop ? (in case of WebEx for example)
[08:20] <reisio> gal: why wouldn't you be able to...
[08:20] <wafflejock> gal: I don't think you can
[08:20] <cfhowlett> gal, yes with a bridged network ... at least yes in virtualbox ...
[08:20] <wafflejock> reisio: I think gal is saying share the host from the slave
[08:20] <reisio> could do that, too, but it'd be pointless
[08:21] <wafflejock> not if you want people to be able to view your Ubuntu desktop but have to run WebEx in the VM
[08:21] <reisio> you could, it'd just be silly
[08:21] <reisio> gal: what's the VM for?
[08:21] <Wiz_KeeD> when using the compiled library wkhtmltopdf (static version) should it be placed in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, and what is the difference between the two?
[08:21] <reisio> just that?
[08:22] <reisio> Wiz_KeeD: /usr/local/bin/ is traditional for things the package manager doesn't control
[08:22] <gal> reisio : the bm is used to support WebEx which is not supported in ubuntu 64 bit as i understood here
[08:22] <gal> vm
[08:22] <reisio> Wiz_KeeD: you can place it anywhere, though, and modify your PATH accordingly
[08:22] <Wiz_KeeD> so it would be wise ti place it there
[08:22] <Wiz_KeeD> They are both loaded up as equals i'm guessing?
[08:22] <reisio> gal: what do you need webex for?
[08:22] <reisio> Wiz_KeeD: echo $PATH
[08:23] <wafflejock> Wiz_KeeD: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8656/usr-bin-vs-usr-local-bin-on-linux
[08:23] <gal> thats how we work here for video/chat conference :)

[08:24] <reisio> says it supports linux
[08:24] <gal> Not Ubuntu 12.04, 64bit.... :(
[08:24] <reisio> according to?
[08:24] <wafflejock> reisio: gal was discussing earlier has 64bit the Firefox/java install has to be 32 bit
[08:24] <wafflejock> Google says so
[08:24] <reisio> so use 32-bit
[08:24] <reisio> firefox/java, that is
[08:24] <wafflejock> can't in 64-bit Linux
[08:25] <reisio> sure you can
[08:25] <gal> Well if the windows vm trick that would be much simpler :)
[08:25] <reisio> don't be silly
[08:25] <wafflejock> some issue with Java 32 bit for some reason
[08:25] <wafflejock> I know it sounds silly
[08:25] <reisio> "simpler" :)
[08:25] <reisio> gal: okay, well
[08:25] <reisio> you could vnc or rdp your host into your guest
[08:25] <reisio> and that'd like, work
[08:25] <reisio> but it'd be silly
[08:25] <wafflejock> gal: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9393670/how-to-run-a-32bit-jvm-on-a-64bit-linux maybe this helps and you can avoid that craziness
[08:26] <reisio> slightly less work if you used a seamless mode ready VM solution, I s'pose
[08:26] <wafflejock> reisio: had the same though about vnc but wouldn't that be like pointing a camera at itself
[08:26] <wafflejock> might be cool....
[08:26] <reisio> only if it were

[08:45] <DesignerX> I'm reying to create a "ubuntu persistent live usb"  .. Where can I find more info about the "Virtual Harddrive" that is used to store the data/changes ?
[08:45] <DesignerX> trying *
[08:46] <MonkeyDust> !persistent | DesignerX start here
[08:46] <ubottu> DesignerX start here: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[08:47] <DesignerX> Thank guys .. I already had a look at these but i'm looking for a more "Manual" way of doing it and more info regarding "how it works" not just how to install it
[08:48] <DesignerX> for example, Puppy Slacko looks for  slackosave  file name & save data to it, how does ubuntu know where to save the changes ?
[08:50] <DesignerX> ubottu: on most guides & blogs it requires a "parition" to save the changes.. can these be changed to a file/VirtualHarddrive ?
[08:50] <ubottu> DesignerX: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[08:56] <ht3k> Hey guys, anyone know how I can get Ubuntu to detect my fakeraid (bios) RAID 1? It has detected a previous one I had but I just got two more drives to put in RAID 1 but Ubuntu doesn't recognize them like it did before.
[08:56] <jnhghy> Is there a way to make a file "Run" by default? I changed it's mode to executable but when I start it it asks me how I like the file to start: "Run in terminal", "Display file", "Cancel" and "Run" I want it to Run by default.
[08:57] <reisio> it asks you each time?
[08:58] <jnhghy> reisio: yes
[08:58] <mieczyslaf> hey guys, is there possibility to move side panel do bottom of a screen in 13.04?
[08:58] <jnhghy> reisio: it is a .py file but I get the message: file.py is an executable text file.
[08:59] <DesignerX> mieczyslaf: hi, i'm not expert at this but  I think if you looking for a windows like Linux then use Linux Mint ? its Ubuntu with KDE I think
[09:00] <mieczyslaf> DesignerX: i've got cinnamon and i have kde but it isn't it
[09:00] <reisio> jnhghy: has it got a shebang?
[09:02] <jnhghy> reisio: yes it has

[09:03] <ptl> hi people. I am trying to dpkg-buildpackage / debuild a package and I am getting this error: dpkg-source: error: cannot represent change to repsnapper-0+git20120902.349ce298/libraries/vmmlib/LICENSE: error:   new version is plain file error:   old version is symlink to include/vmmlib/LICENSE ---- how can I fix it?
[09:05] <nerdtron> mieczyslaf, that is also what i want to do in unity, i want the launcher to be at the bottom
[09:06] <dakta> nerdtron, mieczyslaf: AFAIK there is/was a third-party replacement for the Unity Launcher package that had the ability to place it on the bottom.
[09:07] <mieczyslaf> nerdtron: me too, and i don't know how to do it. i know that in 120.04 was a possibility to do it, but as i know in 13.04 there is no such option
[09:07] <dakta> nerdtron mieczyslaf: AFAIK the Ubuntu team has stated that they will not support placing the launcher on the bottom.
[09:07] <nerdtron> dakta, mieczyslaf, i think it is called ubuntu-tweak..when i installed 13.04, it is not supported yet...but now i think it is
[09:08] <dakta> mieczyslaf nerdtron: again, the option to do this does not exist in the system package for the launcher; whether or not the third party replacement is available depends on the exact version pf ubuntu.
[09:08] <dakta> I haven't tried. I have enough tweaked stuff on my ubuntu install...
[09:09] <deSouza> i have a dual boot fedora-ubuntu, so i upgraded my ubuntu and lost my grub where the fedora kernels appeared
[09:09] <dakta> For example, the filesystem/browser not supporting a list-style folder display mode. Who thought it was a good idea to remove that? Are they trying to make their software unusable on smaller screens, or by power users?
[09:13] <nerdtron> deSouza, in ubuntu try to update grub. sudo update-grub
[09:20] <g0t_r00t> hi there

[09:24] <ferrieres> hello everybody !
[09:24] <karab44> how to record desktop activity to a video (av) on ubuntu?
[09:24] <nerdtron> karab44, have you searched record my desktop?
[09:25] <ferrieres> I have a global "slow" problem and dont know where this come from... it's been two weeks since it began to come sever
[09:25] <karab44> nerdtron: I can not see such thing, is it the name of application?
[09:25] <nerdtron> yup.. in the software center, try searching record my desktop
[09:25] <ferrieres> i mean every process is getting slow...
[09:25] <karab44> nerdtron: thank you mate
[09:25] <nerdtron> there are also other programs.. i'm only familiar with record my desktop
[09:26] <ferrieres> for example, i try now to update and this takes 70% of one core (seen with htop)
[09:26] <MonkeyDust> karab44  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ScreenCasts
[09:26] <nerdtron> ferrieres, which process is it?
[09:26] <ferrieres> it was not the case since last update but i dont want to downgrade
[09:27] <ferrieres> the process : apt-update
[09:27] <karab44> MonkeyDust: thanks a lot! I see that record my desktop is good enough (if it records system sound and mic also)
[09:27] <ferrieres> now, the update is finished, it's python that takes 70%
[09:28] <ferrieres> with a file named update-apt-xapian...
[09:29] <nerdtron> ferrieres, have you tried killing it?
[09:29] <ferrieres> another example : htop (on a tty, no X stuff here) is taking 40%
[09:30] <ferrieres> The problem is not killing all process ... it's a question of why does EVERY process takes 10 times what they should use (or what WAS the use before the dist-upgrade) of CPU
[09:31] <ferrieres> nerdtron : i want to use the laptop for working and cannot if i'm to kill all process whenever they used too much CPU...
[09:31] <gordonjcp> ferrieres: if everything is reporting 10 times as much CPU usage, I'd suspect the way you measure CPU usage
[09:31] <gordonjcp> ferrieres: after you do an update there's a bunch of stuff that needs to be re-indexed, which can take some time
[09:31] <ferrieres> i'm not, i just report what htop tells me
[09:32] <gordonjcp> ferrieres: you can always just remove xapian
[09:32] <MonkeyDust> what's xapian?
[09:32] <ferrieres> it's not 'just after', it's been two weeks of every day use , i thought first that was because of the x server

[09:49] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: again, if it works will depend on what it needs, so can't say without more info
[09:49] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: try it and work through problems.
[09:50] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: will putting ikonias_logging_app.tar.gz into /opt/bin with owner ikonia:users work ?
[09:50] <Wiz_KeeD> where is that tar from and what purpose will that serve?
[09:50] <Wiz_KeeD> I got from the framework the error...

[09:59] <deSouza> nerdtron: any suggestions
[10:00] <nerdtron> deSouza, about what?
[10:00] <nerdtron> oh..sorry, have you tried booting into fedora and installing grub from fedora?
[10:01] <disdi> ikonia: did that
[10:02] <ikonia> disdi: ok, so that will hang the kernel/pause it and take a dump
[10:02] <ikonia> disdi: job done
[10:02] <deSouza> last time it happened I had to boot with fedora

[10:02] <disdi> ikonia:kernel hangs but does not reboot
[10:03] <deSouza> what do you mean booting into fedora? using the liveos

[10:04] <ikonia> disdi: you need to reboot it
[10:04] <deSouza> lvm?
[10:04] <disdi> ikonia: after that I do not find the vmcore file in /var/crash ?
[10:04] <nerdtron> i think by default when you install fedora it will assume you're going to use lvm right?

[10:05] <Wiz_KeeD> ikonia, in order to use the static library of wkhtmltopdf for ubuntu 12.04 64bit are these dependencies required as this user/post and others suggest? sudo apt-get install openssl build-essential xorg libssl-dev

[10:05] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: ok ?
[10:05] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: what do you want me to do about it ?
[10:06] <nerdtron> deSouza, sudo apt-get install lvm2 in ubuntu then try to update grub...if that doesn't do anything, i'm out of advice
[10:06] <deSouza> ok
[10:06] <disdi> ikonia: help me
[10:06] <disdi> ?
[10:06] <Wiz_KeeD> are they required? I don't want to install unnecesairy libraries, I got the idea from some articles that just 32bit systems would require them
[10:06] <Wiz_KeeD> I could be wrong
[10:06] <disdi> ikonia: help me ?
[10:06] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: how do I know if they are required ? I didn't write the software ?
[10:06] <Wiz_KeeD> should it be ok if i install it?
[10:06] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: if the documentation says it's required - then who am I to argue
[10:07] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: although build essential seems agressive
[10:07] <ikonia> disdi: I'm sorry, help you with what ?
[10:07] <disdi> ikonia: help me ?
[10:07] <ikonia> disdi: just saying "help me" isn't going to get very far
[10:07] <Wiz_KeeD> I see some extra packages including dpgk something, i chose no when i saw that
[10:07] <deSouza> its already latest version
[10:07] <disdi> .crash is there in /var/crash/ but no vmcore file
[10:07] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: what are you actually trying to do ?
[10:07] <ikonia> disdi: have you got kdump setup ?
[10:08] <disdi> I did sudo apt-get linux-crashdump
[10:08] <disdi> ikonia:I did sudo apt-get linux-crashdump....it thought  it would have done the rest
[10:09] <ikonia> disdi: I do'nt know what's in the that package, you'll need to check
[10:09] <deSouza> nerdtron: last time it happened someone said ubuntu had screwed with something, which I forgot what it was. But related to the grub. I had to reconstruct it or something.
[10:09] <disdi> ikonia:then too after crash vmcore should have been there
[10:10] <disdi> ikonia:even if kdmp is not there
[10:10] <ikonia> disdi: as I said, I don't know what's in that package, you'll need to check
[10:10] <ikonia> disdi: you'll need "something" to dump the running kernel vmcore
[10:10] <disdi> ikonia:so should I also always need kdump right?
[10:10] <karab44> recordmyDesktop is very nice app, but it's a bit pitty it doesn't offer multithread encoding. All operations made on one core makes it a bit slow.
[10:11] <disdi> ikonia:i will check in the package if its thr
[10:11] <Wiz_KeeD> ikonia, I use a python erp framework that has a reporting engine installed which requires wkhtmltopdf to work.I have it installed on two other systems but for my case on local doing what I did in the others (just copy the untared version of wkhtmltopdf static) changing owner to root doesn't work and the framework prints out the default message you get when you type "wkhtmltopdf" in the console instead of printint the report
[10:11] <disdi> ikonia:so should I also always need kdump right?
[10:12] <Wiz_KeeD> Also spits out this error: http://pastie.org/8329720
[10:13] <ikonia> disdi: you'll need something, yes
[10:13] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: ok, so you're passing an invalid argument and as such the file is probably not generated in /tmp
[10:14] <Wiz_KeeD> The thing is the same database on the other system works fine, it could be that it's passing the wrong argument but since i havn't changed anything I would suspect the library having an issue or something...i'll need to investiage further
[10:14] <deSouza> nerdtron: updating grub screwed my mbr
[10:14] <deSouza> so now i need to rewrite it
[10:15] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: are the other machines running the same software versions ?
[10:15] <Wiz_KeeD> let me check
[10:15] <Wiz_KeeD> Linux ubuntu 3.2.0-33-generic-pae #52-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 18 16:39:21 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
[10:15] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: no - that's a kernel
[10:15] <Wiz_KeeD> this is 32bit
[10:15] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: I asked if it was running the same software versions
[10:15] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: not what kernel version or architechture it is
[10:15] <Wiz_KeeD> yes
[10:16] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: so they are both running the same versions of ubuntu, the same versions of the framework and the same versions of the 3rd party software ?
[10:16] <Wiz_KeeD> let me check

[10:36] <jluc> one year ago, cmake 2.8.9 was made available. See www.cmake.org . Now is 2.8.11 av ailable. Ubuntu standard repo still provides 2.8.6 . When shall more recent version arrive ? Or what's the best way to be able to use more recent version ?
[10:37] <jluc> (2.8.6 dates 2 years ago)
[10:38] <njsg> I guess build systems are something that can break stuff quite easily if you just update them because a new version is available
[10:39] <jluc> i need 2.8.9 to build scribus svn
[10:39] <geirha> jluc: 12.04 has 2.8.7, 12.10 has 2.8.9, 13.04 has 2.8.10, and 13.10 is getting 2.8.11
[10:39] <jluc> im on 12.04 !

[10:40] <geirha> jluc: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=cmake&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all
[10:40] <jluc> but i need 2.8.9
[10:40] <jluc> (at least)
[10:41] <DJones> jluc: Thats one of the policies behind UBuntu, they don't bring new versions into older distribution releases unless there's a specific bug fix
[10:42] <jluc> so what's the best way : upgrade ubuntu ? download newer source and compile cmake ?
[10:42] <DJones> jluc: Probably the only options would be to either upgrade (which may not make sense as you're on a LTS release) or to look for a ppa, however they're not officially supported so if there was an issue, you'd need to go to the ppa maintainer about it
[10:42] <njsg> jluc: I'd maybe try to just install the package for the other distro
[10:42] <geirha> jluc: Look for a PPA with a newer version for precise, build it yourself, or upgrade to a newer Ubuntu release
[10:42] <DJones> !ppa | jluc
[10:42] <ubottu> jluc: A Personal Package Archive (PPA) can provide alternate software not normally available in the offical Ubuntu repositories - Looking for a PPA? See https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas - WARNING: PPAs are unsupported third-party packages, and you use them at your own risk. See also !addppa and !ppa-purge
[10:42] <njsg> jluc: maybe it even works; the easiest way of them all is to compile from source, but that requires a toolchain, which is not that common in a binary-based distro
[10:43] <jluc> i will look for a ppa (and if i dont find, scribus svn will loose a tester)
[10:44] <bencc> is there ASCII code for exit signal?

[10:45] <jluc> thanks djones for the link
[10:45] <njsg> bencc: it has an exit status, is that what you mean?
[10:45] <bencc> njsg: I want to send an exit signal to a shell script to force it to exit. something like CTRL+C
[10:45] <njsg> that's a number, handled by the parent process
[10:45] <njsg> bencc: hmm, you should read a bit on UNIX signals
[10:45] <njsg> bencc: there is an actual mechanism of stuff called signals, which you can send to processes
[10:46] <njsg> bencc: you *can*, in fact, send a process a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal. in fact, CTRL+C in most shells sends SIGINT to the process
[10:46] <njsg> the process does not get any CTRL+C itsel, it just gets the SIGINT
[10:47] <njsg> dunno if ubuntu has the manpages, but "man 7 signal"
[10:47] <njsg> you need the process ID to send a signal, though. Also, most tools and functions to send a signal are called kill, but they also send the other signals like SIGINT or even signals that aren't supposed to terminate anything
[10:48] <MonkeyDust> whoever asked for that exit signal: find 'exit' on this page, hope it's useful https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(computing)
[10:49] <bencc> njsg: is there an ascii code for the CTRL + C or SIGINT signal?
[10:49] <bencc> njsg: how do I send it?
[10:49] <nibbler> hey, i just saw that when i click on a file, properties, and select the tags-tab ubuntu somehow shows me all kind of stuff to chose from - tags i used on my pictures, things i might have googled, or it might be scraped from my bookmarks or such - how is this list compiled?
[10:50] <njsg> bencc: for SIGINT, no, SIGINT is part of the UNIX signal mechanism, ctrl+c may have one, but it's likely not used in linux at all to terminate processes

[11:21] <nechko> sup
[11:21] <nechko> got one question
[11:21] <nechko> will ubuntu 13.10 current daily image be upgraded through updates to full version once its out
[11:21] <nechko> ?
[11:22] <resager> Hi all. Please, help!
[11:22] <nechko> and another question what happened to LTS ?
[11:22] <resager> I am use command "chown -R 7777 ." in not user folder and then i can`t Enter to system (and permission on ~/)After reboot i Enter my password in form and LogOn is not work! Passord is correct (if use uncorrect password, i can see red text)
[11:22] <geirha> nechko: Yes
[11:22] <DJones> nechko: Yes it will, best to ask about 13.10 is in #ubuntu+1 though
[11:22] <resager> What i can do?
[11:22] <geirha> nechko: nothing happened to LTS
[11:22] <DJones> nechko: 12.04 is LTS, next LTS is due 2 years later with 14.04
[11:22] <nechko> aaa
[11:23] <nechko> sorry i didnt know that geirha DJones
[11:23] <geirha> resager: Never ever do chmod 777 or 7777 again. Ever.
[11:23] <nechko> i thought every x.04 version should be lts :D
[11:23] <nechko> but i can see now that doesnt make sense at all
[11:23] <nechko> :D
[11:23] <DJones> nechko: No worries, LTS releases are only every 2 years
[11:23] <resager> geirha ok :(
[11:23] <geirha> resager: You have to boot into recovery mode and fix the permissions back to some sane ones
[11:24] <resager> geirha what  i can write to console?
[11:25] <geirha> resager: Oh hang on, you ran chown, not chmod?
[11:25] <nechko> btw thanks this was fastest answer every (not much of IRC user, but as i can see things will change now :D) geirha DJones
[11:25] <resager> My ubuntu is one OS on PC, how i can use recovery mode?
[11:25] <nechko> ever*
[11:26] <geirha> resager: If so, you chown it back to your user:  E.g.  chown -R yourusername /home/yourusername
[11:27] <geirha> resager: Hold down shift while booting to get the grub menu; then select the recovery option
[11:28] <nechko> exit
[11:28] <nechko> exit
[11:28] <nechko> exit
[11:28] <FloodBot1> nechko: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[11:28] <resager> geirha, thanks!
[11:30] <new-linuxer> is there a way to install ubuntu's virtualbox extension pack from the ubuntu's repos?
[11:31] <cfhowlett> new-linuxer, you may have noted that it's not IN the repo 's ...
[11:33] <new-linuxer> cfhowlett the official download site is giving me "Access Denied".. I have version 4.1.12 is there a way to get the extension pack?
[11:34] <cfhowlett> new-linuxer, so no download available?
[11:34] <new-linuxer> cfhowlett nope :( I installed virtualbox from the software center..
[11:35] <cfhowlett> new-linuxer, Ok, well, the version in the software center doesn't support the extension pack as I understand it.
[11:36] <Trudko> guys  i am windows user and I am not sure if I can gain something serious especi in terms of productivity if I switch to linux. Most articles only talks about advatnages like, having free software, better security etc.I am developor(Ruby, Java, Javascript, Nodejs) and i would like some article for advanced user.
[11:36] <new-linuxer> cfhowlett OK thanks for the info, I guess I have to replace it then
[11:37] <cfhowlett> Trudko, what exactly do you WANT to do?
[11:38] <Trudko> cfhowlett: i think i would be able to benefit from command line, so maybe I would like to see some article which would compare how fast you can do things with that. but I guess i could find something about it.
[11:41] <Head-phone> Trudko: using some life-disk/pendrive/whatever is easy as pie, why not try it?
[11:41] <Trudko> Head-phone: cfhowlett for example I do enjoying using launchy on Windows
[11:42] <cfhowlett> Trudko, make a boot usb.  boot up.  play.  "something with the command line" is definitely doable in ubunut.
[11:42] <cfhowlett> *ubuntu*
[11:42] <Trudko> Head-phone:  I have ubuntu installed on VM i just worry, that because I am not that experienced with linux I will miss some good futures.
[11:42] <Head-phone> there are many guides out there giving introductions to the command line
[11:44] <Head-phone> in general, day to day use , i find the GUI to work faster for me, but the moment you need regular expressions the commandline is infinetly more powerfull

[11:53] <UrielVigilant> Good afternoon, now iam on Ubuntu 13.x persistent usb. When i try to download flash player from adobe, it ask me wich program to open it . I dont know what program is this!
[11:53] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[11:53] <bazhang> UrielVigilant, install flash from ubuntu repos, not adobe site
[11:54] <giorgiodinapoli> hey guys i switched via sofware manager to proprietary radeon driver, no nothing is working, how can i switch back to xorhg driver from command line?
[11:54] <bazhang> !flash | UrielVigilant
[11:54] <ubottu> UrielVigilant: To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash - See also  !Restricted and !Gnash
[11:54] <Trudko> Head-phone: really? I found some small tricks very useful, like setting some variables around, or moving around file system and running things
[11:54] <BluesKaj> UrielVigilant, no need to download it from adobe , just use the software center and install ubuntu-restricted-extras
[11:54] <bazhang> Trudko, pardon?
[11:54] <UrielVigilant> ok
[11:55] <Trudko> bazhang: ?
[11:55] <bazhang> Trudko, what does you r post have to do with ubuntu support
[11:55] <Trudko> bazhang: I am continuing conversation
[11:56] <Head-phone> and the original request was about information regarding the use of the commandline, if im not mistaken
[11:56] <UrielVigilant> Thank you very much BluesKaj once again. Perfect for a newbie like me.
[11:57] <BluesKaj> np UrielVigilant
[11:59] <Trudko> Head-phone: yeah pretty much, one thing i like about launchy is for example that you can run search query for some website lets say youtube and it opens default browser for you.
[11:59] <UrielVigilant> I love this Ubuntu 13 way to work...
[12:00] <tonph> hi all..

[12:04] <alias_bij> Hi, I burned the Raring (13.04) server AMD iso to disk; booting from it brings to GRUB shell not the menu; and I can't install from that.
[12:04] <alias_bij> I tried "set gfxpayload=keep" (new line) "linux /install/vmlinux file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-server.seed quiet --"
[12:04] <alias_bij> but then it hangs and nothing happens.
[12:04] <tonph> cfhwowlett: thanks
[12:07] <alias_bij> extract_menu_config or something did the trick
