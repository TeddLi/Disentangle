[08:21] <eseven73> Seveas: thats /msg ubotu and not ubottu right?
[08:21] <jason>  do you have both enabled
[08:21] <Lars> jason, one is coming up as a crt even though it isn't
[08:21] <Seveas> eseven73, /msg ubottu
[08:21] <rww> Maggie: hmm. I see a bunch of people saying they have this problem, but no solution to be found except for "Does this still happen in intrepid?" "No." =/
[08:21] <raylu> yoyit2: i have no idea :P
[08:21] <Don_Miguel> raylu,  http://paste.ubuntu.com/100155/   what next ? ( I did not get to have a snack ! the cupboard is bare !! so my brain is energy deprived ... pls spell it ALL out for me ! )
[08:21] <jason> cuz you have a vga output in vid card right
[08:21] <eseven73> k you said ubotu earlier Seveas kinda confused me :)
[08:21] <miranda_psi> JaZ969: to install that you will have to first: "./configure" then "make" and finally "sudo make install"
[08:21] <yoyit2> raylu:  arg .. :(
[08:21] <kerry_> i'm back.... i've got adept open, now is there any way i can view available packages by category? (ie office, graphics, etc)
[08:21] <JaZ969> i did configure
[08:21] <Lars> jason, they're both DVI
[08:22] <JaZ969> but after i configure, and i type make it does this
[08:22] <hellhound> Seveas:  the application launched with command but it did not do the preload
[08:22] <Seveas> eseven73, apologies. Ubotu was the previous bot in here, which died.
[08:22] <JaZ969> make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
[08:22] <Maggie> rww, i am having this problem since 3 days.before it was alreght
[08:22] <miranda_psi> JaZ969: get any errors from the configure?
[08:22] <JaZ969> no
[08:22] <jason> k i don't know why that is but it recognizes it so lets move on
[08:22] <JaZ969> would you lik eme to paste
[08:22] <JaZ969> a ./configure
[08:23] <Seveas> hellhound, do you see the LD_PRELOAD variable in the contents of /proc/pid-of-application/environ ?
[08:23] <jason> in the model drop down box select your dvi moniter
[08:23] <miranda_psi> JaZ969: no makefile has been made and thats usually the cause is a configure finding an error
[08:23] <yoyit2> anyone know why i cant delte fiiles from my SD card?? but i can write them??
[08:23] <miranda_psi> JaZ969: paste it up an ill take a look
[08:23] <JaZ969> ok
[08:23] <jason> select twinview and resolution to your choice with your hurts
[08:23] <Bikeguy> I was wondering, do any of you know of any Usenet Clients that are similar to Grabit for Windows? Server Searching, all that. Any clients you would recommend?
[08:23] <Seveas> hellhound, also make sure you didn't have a ; in the command between the variable and the app

[08:24] <JaZ969> IM SO BLIND
[08:24] <cmkAus> I joined a bugsquad team can I join another team?
[08:24] <JaZ969> lol!
[08:24] <FloodBot2> JaZ969: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:25] <raylu> Don_Miguel: that's... strange.
[08:25] <cmkAus> i am in the wrong chat room
[08:25] <cmkAus> wheres the beginner room
[08:25] <Mayank> my other pc is not connecting to internet (ubuntu)
[08:25] <raylu> Don_Miguel: sudo aptitude -s remove perl-modules
[08:25] <jason>  then apply and you should get a message saying somethings can't be done but apply what can be applied and it should work
[08:25] <Bikeguy> Seveas: hey, sorry i'm not to familiar with linux, trying to get better, how would i do what you said?
[08:25] <Don_Miguel> raylu, Update manager still shows those 25 waiting to upgrade
[08:25] <Robbie_Crash> I'm still having a problem when I disconnect a secondar, non mounted harddrive. When I do, I can't boot. More info here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1028757 . I've looked through the syslog, but I don't know enough about Linux to determine where it's checking something, and what it's missing, and I don't think that the failed boots would log anything to syslog, so I don't know how I'll really be able to figure out where the problem actua
[08:25] <Bikeguy> Seveas: is it anything like apt-get? or what is it exactly
[08:26] <ziroday> cmkAus: beginner room for what?
[08:26] <Maggie> I am not able to upgrade from ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10 using CD ........ can any1 help me
[08:26] <cmkAus> ubuntu
[08:26] <Seveas> Bikeguy, yes, you tun that command in a terminal
[08:26] <jason> Lars: u still with me
[08:26] <miranda_psi> JaZ969: there was an error in configure (look at line 111) saying that you don't have the pidgin development files instaled, so go into synaptic and search for pidgin and look for files related to pidgin with "-dev" at the end
[08:26] <raylu> Don_Miguel: that's not strange; those 25 have not upgraded yet
[08:26] <Bikeguy> Seveas: thanks, will try that out
[08:26] <inet>  hi. how installhplaserjet
[08:26] <inet> 1020
[08:26] <Don_Miguel> raylu, OK will    sudo aptitude -s remove perl-modules
[08:26] <Lars> Jason...yeah
[08:26] <JaZ969> miranda_psi  I'm installing the pidgin dev files atm
[08:26] <cmkAus> Is there a channel called unbuntu beginner?
[08:26] <eseven73> Maggie: 8.04 is a LTS are you sure you want to upgrade? What's in 8.10 that you need so badly?

[08:27] <eseven73> !LTS | Maggie
[08:27] <ubottu> Maggie: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
[08:27] <Bikeguy> Seveas: so what that did was spit out things that are in the repository? interesting
[08:27] <raylu> !ru | inet

[08:27] <Seveas> Bikeguy, yes, apt-cache searches the local cache of repository info. Very useful
[08:27] <Maggie> eseven73, I am not able to use USB flash drives in my hardy
[08:27] <hellhound> Seveas:  there is nothing in /proc/12368/environ.  The file is blank.  Should i add LD_PRELOAD ?
[08:27] <b1gbawx> what folder do i need to put a program in to make it a universal file accessed by everyone
[08:28] <Seveas> hellhound, you can't edit things in /proc ;)
[08:28] <raylu> b1gbawx: why?
[08:28] <JaZ969> configure: error:

[08:28] <FloodBot2> JaZ969: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:28] <Seveas> hellhound, but this means something screwy is happening
[08:28] <Bikeguy> Seveas: yeah, definitely seems awesome
[08:28] <b1gbawx> what do you mean why
[08:28] <b1gbawx> just what folder is it
[08:28] <raylu> b1gbawx: what are you trying to make accessible, and why?
[08:28] <Seveas> JaZ969, what are you compiling?
[08:28] <JaZ969> musictracker
[08:29] <Seveas> isn't it in the repos?
[08:29] <raylu> b1gbawx: because your question makes no sense. there are many directories that are world-readable
[08:29] <JaZ969> plugin for pidgin
[08:29] <Seveas> !search musictracker
[08:29] <ubottu> Found:
[08:29] <b1gbawx> is it /usr/bin or somethin
[08:29] <Seveas> !find musictracker
[08:29] <b1gbawx> just a regular program iw rote
[08:29] <b1gbawx> i wrote
[08:29] <ubottu> Found: pidgin-musictracker
[08:29] <miranda_psi> JaZ969: try searching for PCRE in synaptic and install the dev files as well
[08:29] <vasyok> hi!!
[08:29] <Seveas> JaZ969, install the pidgin-musictracker package :)
[08:29] <raylu> b1gbawx: the best place for something like that is /usr/local/bin
[08:29] <b1gbawx> thanks
[08:29] <Bikeguy> raylu: thanks for the help a couple of days ago, i ended up doing a full system reinstall, and while i was doing that decided on doing a raid 5 setup

[08:30] <miranda_psi> JaZ969: if its in the package manager thats definitely a better way to go (and much easier as well :D)

[08:34] <robin0800> send test
[08:34] <Don_Miguel> raylu, that one was  NEEDING an upgrade so removing the OLD is part of the UPGRADE ??  I thought we DID remove that   xulrunner-1.9-gnome-support    one !  what is that command ??
[08:34] <Maggie> Robbie_Crash, nothing happens
[08:34] <ziroday> CoUrPsE|DeAd: okay, are there any errors printed in the terminal?
[08:34] <R1cochet> !VMWare
[08:34] <ubottu> VMWare is not available in the Ubuntu repositories. Consider using !QEmu or !VirtualBox as alternatives. Instructions for installing VMWare manually are at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware
[08:34] <CoUrPsE|DeAd> ziroday,  nope.
[08:34] <Robbie_Crash> Maggie absolutely nothing? Does the flash drive have a light on it?
[08:34] <raylu> Don_Miguel: no, we didn't. you ran it with -s. "sudo aptitude remove xulrunner-1.9-gnome-support
[08:35] <ziroday> CoUrPsE|DeAd: okay, is your PCM level on your mixer set to max?

[08:37] <jason> it is 64 bit firefox
[08:37] <ziroday> CoUrPsE|DeAd: this happens as soon as you login?

[08:40] <jason> and just uncompress where?

[08:40] <Don_Miguel> raylu, so I just CLOSE firefox  ?
[08:40] <Maggie> Robbie_Crash, when I open places>Computer .... I get err msg "Nautilus cannot handle computer: locations."
[08:40] <raylu> Don_Miguel: you don't even have to do that, though it can't hurt
[08:40] <raylu> Don_Miguel: the only downside is that if packages are added to ubuntu-desktop, you won't be notified of them
[08:40] <Robbie_Crash> Maggie hold on one second
[08:41] <CoUrPsE|DeAd> Its like the sound device is owned by root and not letting me run audio.
[08:41] <miranda_psi> jason: just uncompress it anywhere really, though somewhere like /usr/lib/ would be a good place
[08:41] <Don_Miguel> raylu, it is a BIG PAIN to close out FF ... as I have LOTS of tabs active !  do I need to close it for safety ?
[08:41] <Kartagis> i tried to create a keybinding in gconf-editor. is there a way to toggle it? Ctrl+Alt+d works fine toggling
[08:42] <miranda_psi> jason: the you just create a symbolic link to the .so object thats in there in the firefox plugins directory
[08:42] <jason> ok and then what
[08:42] <Robbie_Crash> Maggie from the system panel, you click on Places, then Computer, and that Nautilus error comes up?
[08:42] <robin0800> send% test
[08:42] <Maggie> Robbie_Crash, yes
[08:42] <rww> !test | robin0800
[08:42] <ubottu> robin0800: sigh... again? I'm busy here, I already told you it failed.
[08:42] <miranda_psi> jason: once the symbolic link is in place, simply restart firefox and it should all be set
[08:43] <Robbie_Crash> Maggie when did you install Ubuntu, and how did you do it?
[08:43] <jason> ok i have to say can i not just but the .so in /usr/firefox 3.05/plugins directory
[08:43] <raylu> Don_Miguel: like i said, no
[08:43] <raylu> Don_Miguel: but firefox 3 should remember your tabs anyway
[08:44] <jason> I tried that and it gave me a permission error

[08:44] <Robbie_Crash> Maggie are you still using 8.04?
[08:44] <Robbie_Crash> or have you done the dist_upgrade?
[08:44] <Maggie> Robbie_Crash, yes
[08:45] <Robbie_Crash> Maggie which?
[08:45] <Mayank> my ubuntu is not getting internet connection
[08:45] <Maggie> Robbie_Crash, Ubuntu 8.04
[08:45] <Don_Miguel> raylu, so I say  Y   and accept the solution ? OK
[08:45] <raylu> Robbie_Crash: why would his/her usb drive be mounted at /mnt...?
[08:45] <Robbie_Crash> Maggie thanks, one second. You may have the GVFS issue. Let me research a second here.
[08:45] <raylu> Don_Miguel: yes
[08:45] <miranda_psi> jason: doesn't work like that - the .so may require other files and if they are not there then it won't work so just use the symbolic link (ln -s /file/to/link/to /path/to/link)

[08:50] <homy> Hello, I have a problem with the "Create USB Startup disk". I used the programm to create a intrepid 32bit startup disk (but I'm using a 64bit intrepid os). It did that successfully (at least it said that), but I can't boot from it. I know my bios can do that, as a also tried selecting the boot device manually (using F9), selecting "Removable". But then it just says sth like No bootable medium found.
[08:50] <kaps1> Igramul:probably my mbr got messed up ?
[08:50] <Robbie_Crash> raylu I have no idea. She's not done anything abnormal from what she's said, it just mounted there. And she's got an old GVFS error it sounds like, and short of a dist upgrade I'm not sure how to fix that, so I'm reading up on that.
[08:50] <Mayank> my ubuntu is not getting internet connection
[08:50] <Robbie_Crash> Maggie sit tight, I'm still looking
[08:50] <Slart> kaps1: how does it say unallocated? an error message from grub? in gparted? fdisk?
[08:50] <Maggie> Robbie_Crash, OK
[08:50] <Igramul> kaps1, try booting from the live system and fix the grub installation from there.

[08:52] <Slart> kaps1: are there any ext partitions at all anywhere?
[08:52] <raylu> Lars: just try some of the commands/options
[08:52] <kaps1> Igramul:I didnt removed the linux partition but others and reformatted them with new size
[08:52] <Lars> raylu, I wouldn't know where to begin...
[08:52] <cwillu> chris_, what kind of card, and lots of windows open?
[08:52] <kaps1>  Slart:yes there is one swap and another ext3
[08:53] <raylu> Lars: xrandr --help is where to begin :D
[08:53] <homy> Can anybody help me with my usb-creator problem?
[08:53] <Slart> kaps1: you're sure you didn't install it to the wrong partition?
[08:53] <chris_> cwillu: nvidia gforce 8600gt. no, it happens with any number of windows
[08:53] <Igramul> kaps1, what's the "another ext3"? /boot ?
[08:53] <Lars> raylu, I have it up, but I don't know which command is the one I want, mainly because I don't know what the problem is to begin with
[08:53] <raylu> Lars: i think if you just run "xrandr", it should give you the status of your displays

[08:54] <raylu> Robbie_Crash: /mnt? /media?
[08:54] <Igramul> kaps1, try mounting that ext3 from a live CD. If mount fails, You can try ext3.fsck
[08:55] <kaps1> Igramul: mount fails
[08:55] <Maggie> Robbie_Crash, this is what I got bash: cd: /mount: No such file or directory
[08:55] <Robbie_Crash> Sorry,  raylu is right, /mnt, not /mount.

The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot

[09:21] <Don_Miguel> raylu, I do not know that THAT ( an apt crash )  is the problem ... will it hurt anything to try     sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a       ??
[09:21] <chrislees> xfm_: The killall command is only temporary; rebooting will restart pulseaudio. In any case, it looks like Pulseaudio is running even though you are getting error messages
[09:21] <fuctfly> basically what i am trying to do is to see if i am able to call video relay interpreters via ekiga..

[09:21] <ubottu> twinview is a feature provided by nvidia cards, which can be configured with nvidia-settings

[09:23] <tripchronic> hello everybody
[09:23] <fuctfly> ekiga is already installed..  i just need to add h.264 codec to it which is supposedly to be added in the 3.0 version and its nowhere to be found on the snapshot server for apt-get
[09:23] <Don_Miguel> raylu, done    now what ?
[09:23] <Mayank> every time its only have 800x600
[09:23] <fuctfly> i even added deb www. in the sources.list
[09:23] <raylu> Don_Miguel: sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
[09:23] <fuctfly> no luck still
[09:23] <xfm_> chrislees: The problem is still there. How could I monitor pulseaudio? Perhaps launch it from a term? But I can't if pulsaudio relaunches automatically

[09:24] <Mayank> how i do 1024x768 my permanent resolution?
[09:24] <chrislees> xfm_: Keeping an eye on the terminal output might yield some clues, if pulseaudio is the problem
[09:24] <rww> raylu: the new version of ekiga requires different dependencies from the current Intrepid version, so I doubt that'll work =/

[09:29] <fuctfly> ok
[09:29] <fuctfly> i already added this to the sources.list file
[09:29] <rww> CoUrPsE|DeAd: That's odd, you should have one. You could just create /etc/modules with the contents "radeon", owner root:root, permissions -rw-r--r--, and it should work.

[09:31] <fuctfly> only debian does..
[09:31] <fuctfly> acquire files from debain then?

[09:39] <Don_Miguel> raylu, "slow" is probably tired operator being very very careful to follow instructions correctly  :-)    will now attempt to     try "sudo apt-get remove firefox-3.0-gnome-support" first, then sudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq xulrunner-1.9-gnome-support

[09:40] <fuctfly> trying their chan now

[09:40] <Tekno> its 11:40 AM
[09:40] <fosco_> fuctfly: not everyone has your timezone :-)
[09:40] <rww> Lo_: try "mv ~/.wine ~/.wine_old". That'll move your wine configuration out of the way and make a new one. Try running winecfg again after that.
[09:40] <raylu> jessie: using "works" in the same sentence as something about wifi is often an overstatement :P. madwifi works, sometimes

[09:42] <raylu> Don_Miguel: the person had trouble with ussp-push. in the last post, he mentions removing references to that package in /var/lib/dpkg

[10:07] <colton_> what does the tilde ~ before a directory mean ?
[10:07] <GbigG> home directory
[10:07] <Slart> colton_: your home folder.. /home/colton_ or similar
[10:07] <colton_> ~/data,
[10:07] <colton_> It means that it is a home directory?
=== rww_ is now known as rww
[10:07] <colton_> How many home directories can there be?
[10:08] <Slart> colton_: one
[10:08] <Tekno> as many as users
[10:08] <Slart> colton_: one per user =)
[10:08] <colton_> When I tilde a directory it becomes invisible for some reason why is this?
[10:08] <raylu> tilde a directory?
[10:08] <rww> colton_, what do you mean by "tilde a directory"? put a ~ at the end of it?
[10:08] <Slart> colton_: hmm.. how do you "tilde a directory"?
[10:08] <colton_> ~/
[10:09] <Tekno> ~/data is short for /home/colton/data
[10:09] <bazyl> hi everyone !

[10:09] <t94xr_laptop> hey, i have a Sony Ericsson, im having trouble with Ubuntu recognising my phone in either usb mode or phone mode connected via usb - this isnt a bluetooth issue, just a usb device issue
[10:09] <Slart> instead of writing ~/data you can write /home/<yourusername>/data.. it's the same thing..
[10:09] <archman> hello
[10:10] <Don_Miguel> raylu, sorry for the delay   http://paste.ubuntu.com/100200/
[10:10] <EvilMonki> hello
[10:11] <archman> i have wine 0.9.59 installed from repos, and now i'm building new release. can i run it from the source folder without 'make install' ? how to run it properly?
[10:11] <archman> i wanna have two of them...
[10:11] <raylu> Don_Miguel: this is long shot...
[10:11] <raylu> Don_Miguel: cd /var/lib
[10:11] <raylu> Don_Miguel: sudo mv dpkg dpkg-b
[10:11] <Slart> archman: I'm not sure if you can.. but perhaps.. ask in #winehq instead.. they are the real wine experts
[10:12] <rww> archman, ask in #winehq
[10:12] <raylu> Don_Miguel: sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
[10:12] <SiDi> I think it's just "make", archman
[10:12] <archman> ok
[10:12]  * SiDi didn't know about winehq channel :o
[10:12] <rww> archman, it'll probably end up involving passing an option to ./configure, though, if wine is anything like most other programs.
[10:12] <puff> so, I have several USB drive enclosures.  I have had a variety of problems with the drives that came  with the enclosures, because they were preformatted to NTFS, making them difficult to use on certain versionsof linux and macosx.
[10:12] <t94xr_laptop> hey, i have a Sony Ericsson, im having trouble with Ubuntu recognising my phone in either usb mode or phone mode connected via usb - this isnt a bluetooth issue, just a usb device issue
[10:13] <puff> However, because people started putting data on the preformatted NTFS partitions, it was not feasibleto reformat them.
[10:13] <puff> I am about to start usinga 500GB drive.  Before Put data on it and make it unfeasible to reformat it, what format should I put on it?
[10:13] <archman> rww: i did configure --prefix to another location...
[10:13] <rww> archman, then make install should install it to that other location.
[10:13] <nsadmin> puff: consider an lvm PV
[10:13] <rww> puff, which operating systems need to be able to read the drive?
[10:13] <puff> rww: All of them.
[10:13] <nsadmin> then a PV woudlnt' work
[10:14] <Don_Miguel> raylu, OK   (1)  cd /var/lib  (2) sudo mv dpkg dpkg-b  (3)  sudo aptitude safe-upgrade       is there spozed to be a SPACE in #2  -b ??
[10:14] <t94xr_laptop> rww: lol fat32 should read ok
[10:14] <rww> puff, do you need the ability to create files larger than 4GB?
[10:14] <puff> t94xr_laptop: I cannot help you directly, but I can point out bitpim, which is a python-based PIM that has support for a great many phones.
[10:14] <raylu> Don_Miguel: no
[10:15] <puff> rww: Not generally, though it is likely I will be sneakernetting around multimedia files (e.g. movies, etc) with this drive.
[10:15] <raylu> Don_Miguel: i wonder what happens when you run apt/dpkg without /var/lib/dpkg. i don't want to remove it, of course, so we're renaming it to dpkg-b
[10:15] <archman> rww: they answered me to just run the shortcut in the root of the source (the one that points to /tools/winewrapper
[10:15] <nsadmin> puff: why not use the drive to temporarily hold the files on the ntfs drives so you can put a different fs on them?
[10:15] <t94xr_laptop> puff: its not the program, i can do that, ubuntu doesnt recognising my phone - when its usb mode (flash stick mode) or in phone mode
=== tyfoo2 is now known as tyfoo
[10:15] <nsadmin> then when you're done, use the drive for whatever
[10:15] <Don_Miguel> raylu, OK .. as a #4 ? in this list ?
[10:15] <rww> puff, because the only filesystem supported out-of-the-box by Ubuntu, OS X, and Windows is FAT32, which has a 4GB-per-file size limit.
[10:15] <puff> rww:  however, to date most of those files are under 4GB.
[10:16] <raylu> Don_Miguel: er? you've already given me 1, 2, and 3. what would it mean if it were 4?
[10:16] <rww> puff, Windows and Ubuntu can read and write ntfs out of the box, but OS X can only read. Only Ubuntu can read ext2/3 out of the box (OS X and Windows require plugins). HFS+ is a pain in the ass on anything that isn't OS X...
[10:16] <Don_Miguel> I have just done  1 & 2 about to do 3 ...
[10:16] <puff> nsadmin: Well yes, that's a possibility, but if there's a better format to put on this drive sarting out, I'd prefer to do so
[10:17] <raylu> Don_Miguel: hm? you've already shown me grep -r xulrunner /var/lib/dpkg | head
[10:17] <puff> rww: Okay, so are there any major drawbacks to fat32?
[10:17] <rww> puff, 4GB-per-file size limit and no file permissions.
[10:17] <puff> rww: I suspect I can live with that.
[10:17] <rww> puff, if you don't have any >4GB files, and you don't need file permissions, use FAT32.
[10:18] <nsadmin> puff: if you're going to use the drive for temporary purposes, the filesystem you pick should be for the temporary purpose... after that, you can format to whatever you want for the more permanent purpose
[10:18] <Don_Miguel> raylu, in current list you gave me, I am about to do    sudo aptitude safe-upgrade     and then you said: [06:15] <raylu> Don_Miguel: i wonder what happens when you run apt/dpkg without /var/lib/dpkg. i don't want to remove it, of course, so we're renaming it to dpkg-b
[10:19] <puff> nsadmin: I'm going to use the drive in an external USB enclosure as a combination of backup device and sneakernet
[10:19] <puff> The latter purpose most likely for movies, etc.
[10:19] <raylu> Don_Miguel: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[10:19] <puff> Which makes macosx a priority, win32 a lesser priority.
[10:19] <nsadmin> what about the other drives? do you want to reformat them and rewrite the data to them?
[10:19] <raylu> Don_Miguel: "mv dpkg dpkg-b" renames dpkg to dpkg-b
[10:19] <puff> So, I can live with <4GB and no user permissions.
[10:19] <raylu> Don_Miguel: i was just explaining what those 3 commands do
[10:20] <puff> nsadmin: Eventually I'd like ot reformat them.  I have about 5-6 drives in the 160GB to 250GB range, and one terabyte drive.  All formatted ntfs.
[10:20] <Don_Miguel> raylu, OH, OK ... I did mention TIRED I think !  <grin>
[10:20] <puff> nsadmin: However, for now I just want to get this new drive set up "right".
[10:20] <t94xr_laptop> puff: may i suggest a NAS (Network Attached Storage)
[10:21] <nsadmin> puff: you could do those now, before you put the 500g drive into permanent service... you have that opportunity until you do so
[10:21] <puff> nsadmin: Then I can contemplate shuffling data around and reformatting drives.   Two ofthe drives (250GB each) don't seem to work proeperly.
[10:21] <puff> nsadmin: Getting the new drive working is a higher priority than shuffling, etc.
[10:22] <Trenter> I'm a migrating windows user and I am trying to find the Linux equivilant of Task Manager, mainly because I am trying to force stop a program in wine
[10:22] <nsadmin> I'm just saying you can shuffle more easily now than you would be able to if you put the drive into permanent service now
[10:22] <puff> t94xr_laptop: I'm considering that, but more likely before that happens, I'll get another terabyte drive (or two) and stickthem in a spare ubuntu box as a fileserver.
[10:22] <PolitikerALT> Trenter: Try CTRL+ESC
[10:22] <nsadmin> other than the tb drive
[10:22] <PolitikerALT> Trenter: or start the gnome-system-monitor
[10:22] <puff> nsadmin: Yes, and if I wanted to spend a week copying data back and forth, I'd consider that.
[10:22] <rww> puff, you could also stick with ntfs and use the ntfs-3g FUSE driver on Ubuntu and OS X, now that I think of it.
[10:22] <rww> !ntfs-3g | puff
[10:22] <ubottu> puff: ntfs-3g is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. Installation instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions
[10:23] <puff> rww: Yeah, but then I'd have to worry about upgrading the macosx boxen and that gets political.
[10:23] <rww> puff, ah. Nevermind that idea, then.
[10:23] <puff> rww: I'm just looking for the "right" format to moveto, at this point.
[10:23] <Don_Miguel> raylu,  here is paste #12 !   http://paste.ubuntu.com/100206/
[10:23] <PolitikerALT> Trenter: you could also run xkill to kill a window
[10:23] <nsadmin> you can still use ntfs-3g to access the drives which already are ntfs
[10:24] <puff> rww: Most likely,what will happen is I'll get this 500GB working in an enclosure, and then at some point in the not-imediate but not too distant future, stick all the 160GB-250GB drives in a spare ubuntu box and back them up to a fresh terabyte drive.
[10:24] <Trenter> I have a window titled "Untitled Window" but it does not show up in the list of processes
[10:24] <PolitikerALT> run xkill and klick on the window
[10:24] <puff> rww: Baby steps, man  :-).
[10:24] <puff> rww: Thanks for the advice
[10:24] <raylu> Don_Miguel: sudo mkdir dpkg
[10:25] <PolitikerALT> (alt+f2) and then enter xkill
[10:25]  * nsadmin notes in passing that backing up a drive to another drive is not the safest choice
[10:25] <raylu> Don_Miguel: and then safe-upgrade again
[10:25] <nsadmin> if you have that much storage and you're supporting people for work, then you need tape drives
[10:26] <raylu> Trenter: the equivalent of task manager is the command line tool "top". otherwise, ctrl+esc may give you a gui version. "ps -e" is useful too.
[10:26] <Don_Miguel> raylu, OK  sudo mkdir dpkg    and then    safe-upgrade again
[10:26] <puff> nsadmin: Yeah, that's a whole 'nuther issue. Tape drives are kinda pricey.  This is an odd situation, not quite "work" but not personal either.
[10:26] <raylu> Trenter: but what you probably want is wineserver -k
[10:26] <Trenter> That did it, many thanks
[10:26] <nsadmin> then does money change hands in exchange for use of the storage?
[10:27] <marcin_ant> hello all
[10:28] <puff> nsadmin: Not really.  It's a small coalition of cash-poor freelancers and 3D guys trying to get a toehold.
[10:28] <PolitikerALT> Hello, is there some thing like "RAID over Lan"? I mean like synchronisation, but syncronizing all the time when a file has changed.

[10:30] <Don_Miguel> raylu, do we need to rename/move   dpkg-b   back to   dpkg  ??
[10:31] <puff> what a cool quote:  "A person with ubuntu is open and available to others, affirming of others, does not feel threatened that others are able and good, for he or she has a proper self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a greater whole and is diminished when others are humiliated or diminished, when others are tortured or oppressed. ~ Archbishop Desmond Tutu, 1999"

[10:32] <puff> PolitikerALT: It can, depends on how you're using it.
[10:32] <puff> PolitikerALT: I have only brushed the surface with rsync, but one mode of using it is you run rsync locally and it pushes deltas (changed data) to a daemon on the remote system.

[10:34] <Ruudi> anyone speaks russian? could use some help to translate "IT support" to russian
[10:34] <puff> PolitikerALT: Just a heads up, in my expereince rysnc is very finicky about file specifications, specifically it seems most straightforward thing to do is to specify *both* the source and destination paths with a trailing slash, e.g. rsynch /source/path/ /dest/path/
[10:34] <rww> !ru | Ruudi
[10:34] <ubottu> Ruudi: Пожалуйста посетите #ubuntu-ru для получения помощи на русском языке  / Pozhalujsta posetite #ubuntu-ru dlya polucheniya pomoshi na russkom yazyke
[10:35] <Ruudi> thnx rww
[10:35] <PolitikerALT> puff: thanks
[10:36] <puff> PolitikerALT: The trailing slash tells rsync that you want "path" to be a directory at both locations, and you want th econtents of "path" to be synchronized.  Beyond that it gets iffy, but the safest thing seems to be to have the final element in the file spec be a directory name with a trailing slash.
[10:36] <puff> PolitikerALT: I suspect this is rsync's achilles heel, and if they ever fix it rsync will become far more widespread.
[10:36] <rww> trailing slashes in rsync irritate the heck out of me :(
[10:37] <johny> Helloo
[10:37]  * johny says hello
[10:37] <puff> rww: Tell me about it :-).
[10:38] <puff> rww: Tip:  if you ever have to clean up the results of such, kdiff-3 is invaluable.  Also incredibly handy for when you drift off source control and are trying to merge changes back in.
[10:38] <wj32> how do I disable middle-click pasting?
=== bingqiling is now known as ziroday
[10:40] <puff> rww: However, kdiff-3 can easily bog down on some common use cases.  For example, when I was using kdiff3 to merge a couple different backups of my user directory, I found it *much* easier after I first a) cleaned up mozilla and beagle .files, b) moved four or five jdk hierarhies out of all versions of my user directory .
[10:40] <johny> I'm on ATI radeon 9700 card, can't use fglrx with Intrepid, therefore, I got back to the "ati open-source" driver, but my xorg.cong isn't still configured, which is weird. Can anyone of you have a look http://paste2.org/p/124870
[10:41] <rww> johny, Intrepid's version of Xorg does extensive autodetection, so many users have the default xorg.conf file. I have an ATI card too, and when I used to use radeon, the file looked like that.
[10:42] <Don_Miguel> raylu, did you see my last ? [06:31] <Don_Miguel> raylu, http://paste.ubuntu.com/100214/
[10:43] <johny> rww: Thanks, it's good to know. I was thinking about adding "radeon" line to it. Do you experience problems with CPu use going higher when scrolling any pages, even with dillo?

[10:44] <rww> johny, the Xorg process's CPU usage tends to spike when I scroll or move windows around or do anything... it's only momentary, though, so I never really bothered with it.
[10:44] <rww> johny, adding the radeon line won't hurt, but it won't change anything either.
[10:46] <johny> rww: Say what, I just typed "glxgears", and it eats the whole 100% of my CPU, is it usual behavior?

[10:47] <rww> johny, not sure; I'm running fglrx right now, so I can't check.

[11:01] <Slart> DawnLight: there are some accessability options for controlling the pointer with the numeric keyboard.. but I don't think gnome was meant for keyboard only operation
[11:01] <johny> rww: Thanks, I will.
[11:03] <Slart> DawnLight: but that would of course depend on how you use it.. what programs you run and so on..
[11:04] <ActionParsnip> yo yo yo
[11:04] <alexb92> gday guys, i have ubuntu installed inside a windows partition using wubi and now when i boot into ubuntu it comes up with alot of errors saying read only file system then x sevrer comes up in a big blue screen saying that due to internal erros, xserver can not be started please contact your namufacturer
[11:04] <Slart> good morning, ActionParsnip
[11:04] <alexb92> theres a big ok button
[11:04] <rww> Geh, it's 3am already? 'night, all...
[11:04] <Miguel_2009> Hey dudes, whick Linux (Deb based) distribution do you recommend for a PC with only 256Mb of DDR ?
[11:04] <HomingHamster> can anyone explain to me hoe i would use IP routes on my ubuntu machine to channel different ports down a different connection?
[11:04] <alexb92> and when i press the enter key, i get lead back up to the booting processes screen and it jus stays black
[11:04] <ActionParsnip> Slart: I just got a weird message from you
[11:04] <Slart> Miguel_2009: xubuntu
[11:05] <DIFH-iceroot> Miguel_2009: xubuntu
[11:05] <asea168> i coming
[11:05] <Slart> ActionParsnip: just wondering what time you had there =)
[11:05] <DIFH-iceroot> Miguel_2009: or dsl, but i dont know if it is debian-based
[11:05] <ActionParsnip> Slart: haha 11:00am GMT
[11:05] <Miguel_2009> DSL¿
[11:05] <HomingHamster> is xubuntu ubuntu but with XFCE window manager?
[11:05] <alexb92> 10:05 pm sydney time :P
[11:05] <Miguel_2009> I'll look for it xD
[11:05] <DIFH-iceroot> Miguel_2009: damn small linux
[11:05] <Miguel_2009> Yep homing
[11:05] <DIFH-iceroot> HomingHamster: yes
[11:05] <Slart> ActionParsnip: if your irc-client hadn't been so paranoid it would have answered me =) "/ctcp Slart time" will tell you what time it is here
[11:06] <ActionParsnip> Miguel_2009: puppylinux, xubuntu, DSL (damnsmalllinux)
[11:06] <Miguel_2009> damn samll linux.. i've heared about it
[11:06] <HomingHamster> can i "turn" ubuntu into xubuntu using synaptic?
[11:06] <ActionParsnip> Slart: its pidgin, i have no idea what settings :)
[11:06] <tuchha12> how can i change my boot from 9 sec to 3
[11:06] <Miguel_2009> ahm dsl = damn small linux :P
[11:06] <tuchha12> ?
[11:06] <DIFH-iceroot> Miguel_2009: its a 50mb linux
[11:06] <ActionParsnip> HomingHamster: yes, sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[11:06] <Miguel_2009> tucha12
[11:06] <Miguel_2009> tipe in a terminal:
[11:06] <Slart> HomingHamster: I'm not sure if it will be the same but you can try installing xubuntu-desktop or whatever it's called
[11:06] <HomingHamster> neat, thanks ActionParsnip
[11:06] <Miguel_2009> sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[11:06] <DIFH-iceroot> Slart: it is the same
[11:06] <Slart> ActionParsnip: ah.. pidgin.. destroyer of irc =)
[11:07] <Miguel_2009> then go to the part it says timeout
[11:07] <Miguel_2009> and change 9 for 3
[11:07] <ActionParsnip> Miguel_2009: gksudo gedit dude, sudo gedit is incorrect
[11:07] <HomingHamster> thanks Slart that sounds about right
[11:07] <Miguel_2009> xD
[11:07] <Slart> ah, thanks DIFH-iceroot
[11:07] <ActionParsnip> Slart: it does irc, cant say fairer than that
[11:07] <Miguel_2009> y use always sudo gedit xDDDDDD
[11:07] <alexb92> does any one have any ideas?
[11:08] <Slart> Miguel_2009: gksudo gedit.. never sudo with a gui
[11:08] <ActionParsnip> Miguel_2009: so it sets up the environment and doesnt break permissions and ownerships on files
[11:08] <Slart> !gksudo | Miguel_2009
[11:08] <zhaozhou> Slart, Great tip, thanks for that!
[11:08] <ubottu> Miguel_2009: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
[11:08] <zhaozhou> Slart, the ctcp time-one
[11:08] <ActionParsnip> Miguel_2009: sudo is for cli apps like nano apt-get cp etc
[11:08] <Miguel_2009> ah great xD
[11:08] <Slart> zhaozhou: yes, it's nice.. there are other ctcp commands too.. I just use version and time
[11:08] <Miguel_2009> i always do from the other way now i'll make it as you say xD
[11:09] <stix_> I have this constant annoying sound on my system. Can I restart the sound daemon somehow?
[11:09] <archman> i'm an idiot but i have to ask it again...when i install wine via synaptic i can get wine and wine-dev. How do i get wine-dev installed via sources? I want programs to see that i have wine development files on the dependency check.
[11:10] <Miguel_2009> Well i'll take a look to DSM then
[11:10] <alexb92> is there a way to repair ubuntu with the live cd?
[11:11] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: define "repair"
[11:11] <Slart> archman: I think wine-dev is sources... or at least headers
[11:11] <alexb92> well as in my ubuntu wont boot up due to a read only file system as its installed under wubu\
[11:11] <alexb92> wubi*
[11:11] <alexb92> but it was working fine before though
[11:11] <archman> Slart: and how can i point a program when he needs wine-dev files on installtion?
[11:12] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: i dont think you can fix wubi with live cd, you could maybe mount the hdd imag and work on it from windows
[11:13] <alexb92> lol sorry but im a complete noob when it comes to ubuntu so how do you do that?
[11:13] <alexb92> i tried going into where the ubuntu directory was stored in my C: drive and making it read only there
[11:13] <alexb92> but upon reboot it still didnt recognise it
[11:13] <alexb92> and i tried defragging and disk check
[11:13] <Slart> archman: oh.. I don't really know.. I don't even know where whatever wine-dev installs is located
[11:14] <Slart> archman: /usr/src is a common place.. take a look and see... or check in synaptic what it installs
[11:14] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: its a windows question really, you need something like magicdisk or some other virtual drive system
[11:14] <alexb92> does windows and ubuntu even get along together? or do they try and fight for the partition and the filesystem
[11:14] <alexb92> i have vmware available?
[11:14] <alexb92> or should i just completely remove it and start fresh?
[11:15] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: no they dont fight, they can sit side by side and with some config can read each others files
[11:15] <Slart> alexb92: ubuntu is a nice os.. windows not so much
[11:15] <alexb92> i know and i really like ubuntu\
[11:15] <archman> Slart: /usr/include/ , and /usr/share, and libwine.so in /usr/lib/
[11:15] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: if you are happy to start fresh, its an option
[11:15] <alexb92> its just a pity that there isnt easy ways to fix things unlike windows
[11:15] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: personally i despise wubi
[11:15] <alexb92> but the annoying thing is that i have files in ubuntu which i cant access though
[11:16] <alexb92> and i did a hell of alot of downloading with synaptic
[11:16] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: its because its a half ass install of ubuntu from within windows, if you had a proper install you could boot to livecd and repair easily
[11:16] <Slart> alexb92: I meant as in getting along with other os's too.. ubuntu is pretty considerate when it comes to overwriting stuff.. windows is more of a ignorant crybaby =)
[11:16] <alexb92> yeah i know lol
[11:16] <Slart> alexb92: ahhh.. using wubi.. then I can't really say.. haven't used it myself
[11:17] <alexb92> i just did wubi at the time becoz i didnt have the space but now i have an external hdd so yeah i dont mind using that
[11:17] <alexb92> but the hdd is only usb 2.0 not sata or anything
[11:17] <Mass[UB]> Why do I always get time-out when I try to ping an ip from ubuntu?
[11:17] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: you are also comparing badly due to experience, im sure yuor windows exposure is colossol compared to your linux exposure
[11:17] <Slart> Mass[UB]: uhm.. you're pinging something that isn't answering?
[11:17] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: you can install to usb in the live cd
[11:18] <alexb92> yeah i know
[11:18] <Mass[UB]> Slart: uhm, no when i do it from Windows it's answering, I'm using ubuntu on virtualhost
[11:18] <AdvoWork> anyone recommend another terminal server client for ubuntu other than the "Terminal Server Client"?
[11:18] <Slart> Mass[UB]: try pinging 74.125.79.147, that's a google machine.. it answers to my pings
[11:18] <Mass[UB]> Trust me it's not the ip not answering
[11:18] <alexb92> i mean my experience with ubuntu is a really positive one i love using ubuntu but its just when it crashes and your a new comer to the OS, its kind of hard to do things if you know what i mean
[11:18] <Slart> Mass[UB]: then you probably don't have networking setup properly.. it's not a ubuntu feature
[11:19] <ActionParsnip> AdvoWork: apt-cache search remote desktop
[11:19] <Mass[UB]> --- 74.125.79.147 ping statistics ---, 3 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 2000ms
[11:19] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: thats when you learn most
[11:19] <alexb92> like in windows if something screws up u can repair with the cd or use software which does the things for u
[11:19] <alexb92> exactly
[11:19] <alexb92> and i want to learn linux becoz its the future OS
[11:20] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: its one of them

[11:20] <saera> hi im trying to use rythem box with my ipod so i need to convert my ogg files to a format ipod understands
[11:20] <ActionParsnip> saera: i'd rerip your files, converting from one lossy format to another will degrade quality
[11:21] <alexb92> oh is it possible to install ubuntu on a mac?
[11:21] <alexb92> i have a friend who owns a mac and really liked ubuntu when he saw it on my comp
[11:21] <Slart> alexb92: I think so, yes.. a newer intel-cpu mac, that is
[11:21] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: yes
[11:22] <Snupt> alexb92, why not? ;)
[11:22] <Slart> alexb92: I don't think there's a wubi for os X though
[11:22] <alexb92> how though?
[11:22] <alexb92> i know that mac uses a feature called bootcamp
[11:22] <Slart> !mac

[11:22] <chipt4> alexb92: some models are better supported than others
[11:22] <Slart> bah..
[11:22] <ActionParsnip> alexb92: you can use standard installs on intel based macs, or get the ppc iso for Gx cpus (theres no flash plugin for ppc)
[11:22] <saera> ActionParsnip, i'd really want to be able not, mp3 is simply compressed music files is it not? where would it loose quality?
[11:23] <chipt4> alexb92: rEFIt is the bootloader, i believe
[11:23] <ActionParsnip> saera: converting to ogg reduces quality of the original, like bmp is to jpeg
[11:23] <chipt4> if it's an intel mac
[11:23] <ActionParsnip> saera: if you convert from ogg to mp3 you will loose even more quality
[11:23] <alexb92> saera: aac is a really good format for music
[11:23] <chipt4> google around for a tutorial on the specific model of mac
[11:23] <Snupt> alexb92, flac better
[11:23] <alexb92> 96kbs of aac = 128 kbs of mp3
[11:24] <ActionParsnip> saera: ogg is an awesome format but not so many players like it (I always buy cowon players due to this fact)
[11:24] <Nothingman> siemanko jakies polaki :> tak  z ciekawości

[11:24] <alexb92> oh right
[11:25] <alexb92> well i know that if you are willing to get custom firmware for your mac, you can play ogg files through it as well
[11:25] <quinn`> hi
[11:25] <alexb92> you can also add more themes and other things too

[11:26] <nillerz> Hello! How do I mount a windows partition?
[11:26] <Snupt> hm. What happened with  FlodBoot_1_? :)
[11:27] <ActionParsnip> !ntfs-3g | nillerz
[11:27] <ubottu> nillerz: ntfs-3g is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. Installation instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions
[11:27] <Slart> !ntfs | nillerz
[11:27] <ubottu> nillerz: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions - For write access, see !NTFS-3g or !FUSE
[11:27] <vasyok> mount /dev/sdaX /media/windows_partition

[11:27] <vasyok> mount -t FILESYSTEM_TYPE /dev/sdaX /media/windows_partition
[11:28] <vega> "-t auto" also works quite well

[11:38] <Guillem> Slart, yes, for sure. xfce apps won't complain about gconf
[11:38] <Slart> Guillem: as I now see that you wrote in your question =)
[11:39] <Slart> Guillem: let me boot up my laptop then.. it has plain ubuntu/gnome on it
[11:39] <Guillem> Slart, my concern is that gconf needs to be properly launched with dbus somewhat, since latest gnome release.
[11:39] <Guillem> Slart, also may be a problem of Gnome already running in the remote machine. I'll check that right now.

[11:55] <ActionParsnip> ardaking: do some websearching about xorg.conf, you will see tonnes of guides and help
[11:56] <ardaking> thanks ;)
[11:56] <Slart> Staale-: it's possible using iptables.. I haven't used firestarter but I would be very surprised if there wasn't a way to do it
=== tons2000 is now known as tonsofpcs
[11:56] <siddu> what does this command mean 1>&2 in the command mean ?
[11:57] <ActionParsnip> ardaking: im not overly sure how to do it but you setup displays in there so its probably the best place to start imho
[11:57] <Staale-> Slart:  I currently use firestarter as that properly saves and restores my settings on reboot, and the package to do that for iptables was discontinued in debian afaik. Since I am using firestarter, I prefer not to mess with the underlying iptables rules directly as firestarter won't pick those up I think.
[11:57] <asea168> how to download film???
[11:57] <Slart> Staale-: sounds like a wise decision =)
[11:58] <Guillem> Slart, strange, I've found out how to start dbus manually and "attach" gconf to it, and now I get the error you shown me.... and works much better. Your laptop is in Intrepid?
