[22:19] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: yes might be. fdisk -l listed all 24 disks. these are the disks the kernel itself sees. so all disks are available to linux. cat /proc/mdstat lists the disks available to the array. there are only 22 used. check which 2 are missing
[22:19] <momomo> compdoc, for about a week or two
[22:19] <k1l> sabotender: in most cases its eth0 for the ethernet lan
[22:19] <undecim> voip_, By default, /root is open to the root user, but not the root group. Do 'chmod g+rwx /root' to give the root group access
=== cr is now known as Guest20062
[22:19] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: ok so prob x and y are the 2 missing
[22:19] <sabotender> k1l: the stuff that is commented out have 'wlan0'
[22:20] <k1l> sabotender: i dont know what you are using there to connect. is it a wifi? is it a lan cable?
[22:20] <sabotender> #auto wlan0, #iface wlan0 inet dhcp
[22:20] <undecim> voip_, You can do the same with any system files in /usr, if the group of the file is set to "root"
[22:20] <sabotender> its a lan cable
=== `Yoda is now known as Yoder
[22:20] <voip_> undecim, thank you
[22:20] <k1l> sabotender: so dont worry about the wlan entries
[22:21] <sabotender> you see, I thought it would be eth0 too, but I think it is important to find out to be certain, but I will believe you if eth0 is what is being used
[22:21] <undecim> voip_, "chmod g+r" is read, +w is write, and +x is execute. You need +x on a directory to cd
[22:21] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: ok. somebody here had a similar problem: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/recovering-mdadm-superblocks-713234/ maybe this can help. be VERY careful with the --create switch. it can destroy all your data. don't just copy and paste it.
[22:22] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: they say in that thread that they were able to add the disks with their uuid. does --examine on the disks still return the uuid?
[22:23] <michaelaguiar> yep, the device and array uuid
[22:23] <sabotender> okay, ifconfig -a shows that eth0 is the proper interface
[22:24] <k1l> sabotender: the stuff you put into the network interfaces should look like this: http://paste.ubuntuusers.de/421128/
[22:24] <k1l> change the ip numbers as needed
[22:25] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: OK. i don't want to give any further reccomendations, because i am not experienced with RAID10 and you can lose data here. but the two missing disks are your problem.
[22:25] <sabotender> sweet, I will try it out, give me a moment
[22:25] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: Can I safely remove them from the array, and try to mount again?
[22:26] <undecim> I've seen more data lost to RAID than I've seen lost to disk failures...
[22:26] <undecim> michaelaguiar, What exactly is going on with the raid?
[22:26] <Talidan> the drive is sda
[22:26] <michaelaguiar> undecim: I have an array of 24 drives.  Worked fine last week, today it didnt work.  So now Im just trying to get this raid mounted
[22:27] <undecim> michaelaguiar, Is there any particular reason you have a 24-drive raid? And also, what kind of configuration?
[22:27] <michaelaguiar> undecim: Not sure, didnt set it up.
[22:28] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: try a reboot first. after the reboot check "dmesg" and "cat /var/log/syslog" for clues on whats going on
[22:28] <undecim> Is this using any RAID controllers, or just Linux software?
[22:28] <oizoer> what software do I used to put ubuntu image to a usb drive?
[22:28] <undecim> Not always a good idea to just reboot
[22:28] <Talidan> seems like sda3 is causing a problem
[22:28] <undecim> Unless you've done it once already
[22:28] <michaelaguiar> Ive rebooted already, had to skip mounting because it would just stay on the mounting screen
[22:29] <wonderworld> undecim: he did. that caused the problem
[22:29] <undecim> michaelaguiar, So what system are you working with now? A live Cd?
[22:33] <jbrun> Hey guy, I'm trying to compile Veejay on Ubuntu 10.04 (old, i know), and i get on error 1 leaving directory '/.../veejay-server/libyuv' any idea what I could do to solve this?
[22:33] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: do you understand the difference between assebling an array and mounting it into the filesystem? because thats essential for your task. i think you are mixing up the two terms.
[22:34] <jbrun> I'm a bit a noobie on these things but I'm so close to getting it... Please!
[22:34] <sabotender> why can I not edit 'resolv.conf' by hand? it says that my changes would be overwritten?
[22:34] <sabotender> how can I set my nameservers to something more permanent?
[22:34] <daftykins> you can by removing the package resolvconf
[22:35] <wonderworld> sabotender: NetworkManager overwrites resolv.conf if it's used. you can set nameservers in the GUI for your connections
[22:35] <daftykins> though in my experience, remove the package, set the content then it disappears on reboot. you have to set it after reboot for it to stay there
[22:35] <sabotender> wonderworld: this is a headless server. I have no GUI
[22:35] <sabotender> daftykins: so I have to uninstall the network manager?
[22:35] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: yea, assembling puts the array together, then you mount it
[22:36] <wonderworld> ok. i guess this warning is about NetworkManager overwriting it. if you have no GUI it should work
[22:36] <k1l> sabotender: stop. you said there is a desktop installed
[22:36] <daftykins> sabotender: didn't refer to NM at any point
[22:36] <zippo^> Hello, I have a question. I am on Mac OS X now. I want install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on another laptop (Asus). How do I doing Ubuntu (setup) on USB Stick via Mac OS X?
[22:36] <sabotender> k1l: this is true. this is the desktop version of ubuntu and not the server version
[22:36] <k1l> sabotender: so you have a desktop, you just dont have a monitor attached to it to use the monitor. that is not running a server which doesnt start x11 at all
[22:37] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: did you reboot the machine?
[22:37] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: a couple times already today
[22:37] <daftykins> zippo^: you can 'dd' the ISO onto the correct device, no idea how macs handle device naming though. look up a guide.
[22:37] <zippo^> what is 'dd'?
[22:37] <jbrun> Hey guy, I'm trying to compile Veejay on Ubuntu 10.04 (old, i know), and i get on error 1 leaving directory '/.../veejay-server/libyuv' any idea what I could do to solve this?
[22:37] <bubbasaures> jbrun, You have support till april 2015 on the server, just info.
[22:38] <zippo^> daftykins?
[22:38] <jbrun> Sorry?
[22:38] <sabotender> k1l: right...so what do you recommend that I do?
[22:38] <daftykins> zippo^: a command line program for image writing.
[22:38] <trism> jbrun: you would need to pastebin the actual error
[22:38] <Ben64> jbrun: sounds like you're compiling it, get support from the developer. manually compiled stuff isn't supported here
[22:38] <zippo^> i don't know how, daftykins ?
[22:38] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: here are a few lines from my syslog
[22:38] <michaelaguiar> https://gist.github.com/michaelaguiar/8cee15c33fa64bf1e55f
[22:39] <k1l> sabotender: what are you trying to do now? did you set the static ip in network interfaces?
[22:39] <daftykins> zippo^: what did i say?
[22:39] <zippo^> yes, but how do i with dd
[22:39] <zippo^> i have no idea
[22:39] <zippo^> :/
[22:39] <sabotender> k1l: yes I did. I want to change the name servers to google's
=== Fuchs is now known as zombiefox
[22:39] <daftykins> zippo^: so the part where i said look up a guide?
[22:39] <bubbasaures> jbrun, with a nick Sorry? means nothing. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
[22:40] <bubbasaures> without*
[22:41] <k1l> sabotender: its time to read the documentations :) https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/network-configuration.html#name-resolution
[22:41] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: sdp1: Raid device exceeded read_error threshold. this sounds bad. your h/w seems to be failing. you really should get a tech guy if there is important data on the raid.
[22:42] <undecim> Well with 24 disks, it won't take long to see one fail
[22:42] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: did you set up e-mail alerts with mdadm for failing disks?
[22:42] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: no I didnt
[22:43] <michaelaguiar> undecim: is there an easy way to add one to the array, mount it, add another, etc until I find the fail?
[22:43] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: maybe disks were failing one after another without you noticing it.
[22:43] <undecim> michaelaguiar, your data might be gone
[22:43] <undecim> michaelaguiar, It might be a situation where you need to recover a physical disk to get it back
[22:43] <michaelaguiar> Well what if the data I need is on just one disk?
[22:43] <sabotender> k1l: where do you think I was reading?
[22:44] <michaelaguiar> would I lose it if any of the raid fails?
[22:44] <undecim> michaelaguiar, It depends on the configuration of the data
[22:44] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: mdadm already assembled all the disks it could use. 22 of the 24. the link i gave you explained how to add devices with missing superblock but available UUID.
[22:44] <undecim> configuration of the raid*
[22:44] <undecim> michaelaguiar, Your main goal is to get your data?
[22:44] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: the ones that say missing superblock dont provide the uuid
[22:45] <michaelaguiar> undecim: Yea, I only really need a small amount of data that is on one of these drives
[22:45] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: How can I just remove the two from the list and mount this bad boy
[22:46] <undecim> michaelaguiar, let me load a VM with raid to I have a similar system to test e.g. small scripts on
[22:46] <sabotender> I was reading https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration
[22:46] <undecim> michaelaguiar, If they are all in the same raid, that might not be possible. It depends on the configuration of the raid and which drives failed
[22:46] <michaelaguiar> undecim: oh ok
[22:46] <undecim> michaelaguiar, So I can't say anything for sure until I learn more
[22:47] <Talidan> fixed it
=== zombiefox is now known as Fuchs
[22:47] <undecim> michaelaguiar, Can you paste your logs? dmesg, syslog, etc
[22:47] <k1l> sabotender: if its ubuntu i would stick to the official ubuntu guides.
[22:47] <Mrono> I'm running Ubuntu 14.10 on an MSI GS70 and i'm unable to set the performance governor using cpufreq cli.  When I set it with /etc/default/cpufrequtils
[22:47] <Mrono> It sets to performance then goes back to powersave
[22:48] <undecim> michaelaguiar, also, /proc/mdstat
[22:48] <Mrono> I read that when using the intel_pstate driver it's better to use the performance governor
[22:48] <undecim> michaelaguiar, 'lshw' couldn't hurt

[22:49] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: what does smartctl -H /dev/sdx say?
[22:49] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: smartctl is not installed
[22:50] <michaelaguiar> undecim: https://gist.github.com/michaelaguiar/a7682ded35203b90e604
[22:50] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: ok. that would have shown you if the disks are ok. are you allowed to install stuff?
[22:51] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: yes, I have full access, let me install
[22:51] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar:  "apt-get install smartmontools"
[22:52] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: says test result passed
[22:53] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: found a fail
[22:53] <eatyourguitar> I have AMD E-300 1.1Ghz 2GB ram. I'm currently on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS kernel 3.13.0-44-generic (x86_64). I am looking for a distro that runs better with 2GB ram

[22:54] <eatyourguitar> something for youtube, firefox, vlc
[22:54] <daftykins> eatyourguitar: run xubuntu or lubuntu
[22:54] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: found the 2nd,
[22:54] <eatyourguitar> do you think xmbc would run better?
[22:55] <eatyourguitar> I never tried xmbc
[22:55] <eatyourguitar> I was planning to try xubuntu anyway
[22:56] <bubbasaures> try both and than you will know
[22:56] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: Ok so 2 failed drives total, and I know which ones.  Now if I can just remove them from the array and get this mounted
[22:56] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: it were not x and y?
[22:56] <eatyourguitar> I remember 4 years ago I tried ubuntu netbook edition it was super fast on old hardware
[22:56] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: nope.  it was q and j
[22:56] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: x and y were the ones with the missing superblock or something.  So maybe thats the 4 that are the reason its not starting
[22:56] <bubbasaures> anymore support issues?
[22:56] <eatyourguitar> the only problem was the launcher was huge on a 10in netbook

[22:58] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: try "mdadm --examine --brief --scan " should give us more info on the array
[22:58] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: ARRAY /dev/md/0 metadata=1.2 UUID=6d89d5f4:3e5a2ab7:c2bd2acb:7d6bf108 name=tatooine:0
[22:59] <eatyourguitar> in the 80's computers were doing payroll
[22:59] <eatyourguitar> and other accounting tasks
[22:59] <eatyourguitar> it saved a lot of man hours
[22:59] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: mdadm found j and p and added them to the array. the hardware is failing but mdadm was still able to add them. they will fail soon, you need to replace them but it wasn't the cause your array didnt start
[22:59] <undecim> michaelaguiar, Do you have /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf?
[22:59] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: it's the missing x and y
[22:59] <eatyourguitar> imagine what a free computer could do for a fishing village

[23:01] <eatyourguitar> oh was it Lubuntu
[23:02] <k1l> !lubuntu | eatyourguitar
[23:02] <ubottu> eatyourguitar: lubuntu is Ubuntu with LXDE instead of !GNOME as desktop environment, which makes it extremely lightweight. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu - /join #lubuntu for lubuntu support.
[23:02] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: "mdadm --detail /dev/md0" please.
[23:02] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: mdadm: md device /dev/md0 does not appear to be active.
[23:02] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: remember?  Cant activate it
[23:03] <eatyourguitar> so LXDE I'm guessing is a KDE fork?
[23:03] <Jordan_U> eatyourguitar: No, not even close.
[23:03] <michaelaguiar> I cant seem to get array info either, to remove the 2 drives via mdadm <unconvertable> manage /dev/md0 <unconvertable> remove /dev/sdy1

[23:04] <Jordan_U> eatyourguitar: No. The only difference between different flavors of Ubuntu is the software installed by default. They all use the same repositories, and thus anything that can be installed on one can also be installed on another.

[23:28] <michaelaguiar> wonderworld: You too, man.  Thanks for the help!
[23:28] <undecim> michaelaguiar, You might want to figure out your drive configuration. It's important to know
[23:29] <michaelaguiar> undecim: for sure.  Need to make sure this doesnt happen again
[23:29] <undecim> michaelaguiar, With raid 10, some drives are copies of each other. If all the copies of a drive goes out, the whole thing fails
[23:29] <michaelaguiar> undecim: Ah good to know
[23:30] <michaelaguiar> Man, that was complicated.  Thanks again for the help guys, Im outta here!
[23:30] <eatyourguitar> ok so I tried logout I tried reboot, I disabled autologon
[23:30] <undecim> michaelaguiar, I'm actually not sure how to see which drives are copies....
[23:30] <wonderworld> michaelaguiar: remeber the 2 failing drives
[23:30] <eatyourguitar> still no other options for the gear in the top right
[23:30] <bubbasaures> eatyourguitar, what extra desktop did you install lxde?
[23:30] <eatyourguitar> no I did not
[23:30] <michaelaguiar> undecim: Im recommended we move all of our files to Dropbox for business.  There is no need to manage something like this for what we need
[23:30] <bubbasaures> eatyourguitar, what than?
[23:30] <eatyourguitar> nothing
[23:31] <eatyourguitar> I thought you said this would work
[23:31] <eatyourguitar> misunderstanding
[23:31] <bubbasaures> eatyourguitar, really so you expected them to magically appear?
[23:31] <eatyourguitar> I thought you were telling me I had default packages I could use in Ubuntu
[23:32] <bubbasaures> eatyourguitar, never said anything resembling that
[23:32] <undecim> michaelaguiar, If you keep the raid config, consider using some of those drives as hot spares if you can spare the space
[23:32] <eatyourguitar> I can ap-get lxde
[23:33] <i0d9i20> eatyourguitar, just get lubuntu
[23:33] <bubbasaures> eatyourguitar, one bit of advice, forget the funky found commands on the net, read the ubnutu wiki's only and be clear.
[23:33] <Qbuo> I have a sound issue, can anyone help me out?
[23:34] <eatyourguitar> bubbasaures> eatyourguitar, desktops are chosen at login
[23:34] <eatyourguitar> then you told me to logout etc..
[23:34] <Codmadnesspro> sudo: add-apt-repository: command not found what's wrong?
[23:35] <eatyourguitar> did tell me to apt-get
[23:35] <Codmadnesspro> it says its a ubuntu command on my tutorial
[23:35] <wonderworld> apt-add-repository
[23:35] <eatyourguitar> did not rather
[23:35] <undecim> wonderworld, Both are supposed to exist?
[23:35] <Codmadnesspro> bash: apt-add-repository: command not found
[23:35] <wonderworld> hmm
[23:35] <Codmadnesspro> y
[23:35] <undecim> Codmadnesspro, what version?
[23:36] <Codmadnesspro> Wait, it's not ubuntu, it's a raspberry pie
[23:36] <undecim> lol
[23:36] <Codmadnesspro> running wheezy
[23:36] <Codmadnesspro> I get confused with my vps and pi lol
[23:36] <neoromantique> quit
[23:36] <little> hi
[23:36] <undecim> what you're trying to doesn't sound like it will work on the pi
[23:36] <Codmadnesspro> wheezy and ubuntu are basically the same
[23:37] <Codmadnesspro> I think wheezy is debian actuallly
[23:37] <Jordan_U> wonderworld: It's add-apt-repository
[23:37] <wonderworld> Codmadnesspro: PPAs are not available in Debian
[23:37] <Codmadnesspro> uhm so what would I use instead?
[23:37] <Jordan_U> wonderworld: Interesting, it looks like it may be both :)
[23:37] <wonderworld> i only knew mine :)
[23:37] <little> what O.o
[23:37] <Qbuo> Every time my internet goes out, things f*ck themselves up. Last time it was steam, now I cant hear out of my headphones??
[23:38] <Qbuo> Any idea why this is
[23:38] <undecim> it's BOTH add-apt-repository AND apt-add-repository, but apt-add is just a link to add-apt
[23:38] <undecim> So technically add-apt-repository is the real command
[23:38] <wonderworld> Codmadnesspro: you could manualy try to get the package from the ppa. maybe it works on Debian.

[23:43] <little> how many boys theres in here ?
[23:45] <k1l> Qbuo: audio and internet dont mix together. there must be some other reason. see "dmesg"
[23:45] <k1l> little: this channel is support only. we have #ubuntu-offtopic for chatting
[23:45] <Qbuo> what do you mean see "dmesg"
[23:46] <k1l> !dmesg
[23:46] <ubottu> dmesg is a console command which outputs the kernel ring buffer - an important log for diagnosing problems in  Linux. Often when something errors with hardware it will result in additional lines reported which can be seen by running dmesg in a console.
[23:47] <Qbuo> want me to send a pastebin after running it?

[00:03] <Codmadnesspro> Hi, how can I install ubuntu for my raspberry pi model a?
[00:03] <k1l> Codmadnesspro: you cant since the chip is too old.
[00:03] <Codmadnesspro> Ugh really?
[00:03] <Codmadnesspro> that sucks

[01:06] <kline> no, its just a regular lan internet with an esxi virtual switch up the line connected to a router after tahat
[01:07] <compdoc> what kind of network card?
[01:08] <kline> Intel E1000
[01:08] <k1l_> bihaber: do you see the login screen?
[01:08] <kline> should be very supported
[01:08] <bihaber> i got it with ctrl-alt-f1
[01:08] <compdoc> can you pastebin.com the contents of /etc/network/interfaces
[01:09] <kline> no, its not connected to the internet
[01:09] <V0idFunction> can someone help me out? mitigated my irc server over to a new vps, having a problem with ssl trying to set the new unreal up. I installed openssl and installed the correlating libraries and still receiving the message saying ssl isn't installed when setting up my unrealircd config
[01:09] <kline> actually, ill try really fast
[01:10] <bihaber> k1l_  there is no login screen. gui broke after upgrade to utopic
[01:10] <k1l_> bihaber: what exact ubuntu is that?

[01:11] <Finetundra> hello, how do I get youtube-dl to not give me a 403 error?
[01:12] <kline> compdoc, heres the best i can do: http://i.imgur.com/QxsmqV3.png
[01:12] <eatyourguitar> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_403
[01:13] <kline> compdoc, its notable that 1) on the debian host it works fine, 2) it works fine for about 1 min after ifup on the ubuntu machine
[01:13] <compdoc> kline, you sure that netmask is right?
[01:13] <kline> compdoc, 100%
[01:13] <eatyourguitar> this is a result of you not having permissions to get what you want via the url/port/directory/host etc...
[01:13] <kline> like i said, its strange vendor mask, but it does work
[01:13] <eatyourguitar> like if google updates how the site works the app will create a bad url
[01:14] <eatyourguitar> so you get the same message if you are blocked or it doesn't exist
[01:14] <eatyourguitar> cause you have whitelist permissions to the regular parts of youtube but not private server stuff
[01:15] <compdoc> kline, its very odd. you ever try commenting out the post-down line?
[01:17] <stongo> is this abnormal: in ubuntu 14.04 server I cannot login via ssh until I log in through console?
[01:17] <kline> compdoc, survived 44 seconds
[01:18] <eatyourguitar> Finetundra what is the url you requested that returned 403?
[01:18] <eatyourguitar> maybe there are messages in a log file or output to the console you can read?
[01:18] <Finetundra> eatyourguitar, I've tried multiple url's
[01:19] <eatyourguitar> well that doesn't mean anything
[01:19] <eatyourguitar> have you actually investigated why you are getting 403?
[01:19] <eatyourguitar> do you have solid information that these are working links?
[01:19] <Finetundra> I can make a pastebin of the terminal output
[01:19] <Finetundra> yes they are working links
[01:20] <eatyourguitar> youtube changes stuff around from time to time
[01:20] <eatyourguitar> how do you know they are working?
[01:20] <Bashing-om> bihaber: Often times we see your condition as a result of a 3rd party (proprietary) graphics driver installed, when the system is upgraded that driver is not, and you have a broke display. Show the channel -> sudo lshw -C display | pastebinit . Shows the card and IF/what driver is installed.
[01:21] <eatyourguitar> watching a video and downloading it are most likely different links
[01:21] <Finetundra> eatyourguitar, because I used the link today? I'm not sure what your're asking
[01:21] <eatyourguitar> the app youtube downloader is getting 403 for a link that was created from some user input
[01:22] <eatyourguitar> you told it what video you wanted how?
[01:22] <Finetundra> copied and pasted the link
[01:22] <kline> compdoc, found it, theres a little widget i didnt notice in the topbar scrolled off my tiny windows VM screen for networking, it was convinced that eth0 needed dhcp
[01:22] <eatyourguitar> ok
[01:22] <kline> disabling it resolved the issue
[01:22] <eatyourguitar> is this a website or an app?
[01:23] <eatyourguitar> you paste it into the youtube-dl app?
[01:24] <Finetundra> eatyourguitar, um, its a youtube video
[01:24] <eatyourguitar> youtube-dl is a youtube video?
[01:24] <eatyourguitar> or is it an app
[01:24] <eatyourguitar> or a website
[01:25] <Finetundra> eatyourguitar, oh, thats what you're asking. its a program
[01:25] <eatyourguitar> ok so you need something like http://xmodulo.com/sniff-http-traffic-command-line-linux.html
[01:25] <eatyourguitar> this will tell you what is happening that you can not see
[01:26] <eatyourguitar> so you can see what the broken link is that generates the 403 error
[01:26] <plasmasnake> would anybody here happen to know why /etc/shadow is owned by root:shadow (with permissions 640) and not root:root? what's the use of the shadow group?
[01:26] <eatyourguitar> like if it points to youtube.com/?olddownloadapi.php
[01:27] <eatyourguitar> I just made that up
[01:27] <eatyourguitar> youtube.com/olddownloadapi.php?v=83dd8d
[01:28] <eatyourguitar> then youtube deletes or renames olddownloadapi.php cause of copyright complainers or bandwidth leeches such as yourself
[01:28] <eatyourguitar> youtube-dl is adfree
[01:29] <eatyourguitar> they hate that
[01:29] <eatyourguitar> they lose money
[01:29] <eatyourguitar> well it might not be adfree but they don't like it
[01:30] <Finetundra> eatyourguitar, I got it to work

[01:42] <juddus> its fine
[01:42] <juddus> why not go lts?
[01:43] <happyfr0gg> I am using Ubuntu 14.04. I was just wondering if 14.10 was any more stable and reliable.
[01:43] <juddus> stick to 14.04
[01:43] <happyfr0gg> Will do.
[01:44] <zacwalls> How can i connect to the internet using the built in ssl certs and the keys? Or can i?
[01:44] <bihaber> you might lose your gui when you upgrate to 14.10 like i did
[01:45] <happyfr0gg> bihaber, screw that.
[01:45] <bihaber> me too, if i had know brfore :)

[01:48] <juddus> @zacwalls create your own cert?
[01:48] <bihaber> Bashing-om: there is something on the wiki to remove fglrx drivers but of course the command to fix it doesn't work
[01:48] <freeroute> I'm trying to install a package from precise backports using aptitude but first I would like to see which version it is, the commands 'sudo aptitude show chromium-browser -t precise-backports' nor 'sudo aptitude show chromium-browser/precise-backports' are doing what I'm expecting them to do.
[01:49] <Bashing-om> bihaber: Removing a FGLRX driver depends on how it was installed .
[01:49] <k1l_> freeroute: i prefer apt-get over aptitude
[01:49] <bihaber> Bashing-om: the gui worked fine on 14.04, but broke after upgrade to 14.10
[01:50] <k1l_> bihaber: yes, but that is not helping to solve the issue. we asked a lot of question and you dont answer that but keep repeating "its broken after upgrade"
[01:51] <k1l_> bihaber: "my car is broken" "oh, what is broken" "my car"... how should we help that? we dont know and see what do know and see in front of you.
[01:51] <Bashing-om> bihaber: And I say again .. proprietary drivers DO get broke in the upgrade . 3rd party software that the system has no control over .
[01:52] <bihaber> Bashing-om: is says driver=fglrx_pci  - how do i get rid of it?
[01:52] <sabotender> k1l_: good news, the web server is up and running and live! The code is broken because it needs a slight rewrite, but the name resolution is cool
[01:53] <freeroute> k1l_: I chose aptitude because I got to be lazier with auto completion lol. Also, 'apt-cache show chromium-browser -t precise-backports' doesn't show what I want either.
[01:54] <k1l_> freeroute: you are on 12.04?
[01:54] <freeroute> k1l_: yep
[01:54] <happyfr0gg> bihaber, all I can think of to do is to reinstall 14.04 and then make a backup copy of the graphics drivers that work for your GUI, upgrade to 14.10 and then restore those graphics drivers in 14.10.
[01:54] <k1l_> freeroute: run a "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" then try again
[01:55] <Bashing-om> bihaber: IF you installed from OEM site, use the OEM un-installer .. IF from our repo .. we use 'apt-get remove <packages>' to remove the driver .

[02:01] <Ben64> freeroute: upgrade to 14.04
[02:01] <bihaber> Bashing-om: nothing like that there. i installed long time ago from your repo and have upgraded several times.
[02:02] <freeroute> Ben64: wish I could currently. I thought 12.04 was also still supported.

[02:25] <bihaber> Bashing-om: thanks. i'll give it a shot, will be back after.
[02:28] <Finetundra> NeedSomeHelp, hmm, perhaps a different flavor would work such as ubuntu GNOME. I realize that this may not be a proper solution however you can install unity and have the same end result. sort of.
[02:28] <farva> hey guys, I just had my admin log into the fstp on my account, he saved the file he was supposed to, and when I went to edit it, it did not have rw--rw--r access. I opened a different file, saved it and the perms were fine. How do I get the access back on that file?
[02:28] <Bashing-om> bihaber: Roger that ,, IF and only IF there are problems with the open source driver, then from "Additional Drivers" install the recommended  FGLRX driver once more .
[02:28] <dawid90dd> Test
[02:28] <dawid90dd> ok im in
[02:29] <NeedSomeHelp> Finetundra: where can I choose that? do I need to download a different package  then?

[02:30] <bubbasaures> dawid90dd, I can only help you on this part, run lspci and identify the graphic info and describe what you did best you can, all in one post if possible.
[02:30] <farva> its just odd to me that it would remove perms for the sftp on that one file under my account
[02:30] <dawid90dd> ik, how can i scroll, page up page down doesnt work
[02:31] <juddus> farva: who owns the file?
[02:31] <farva> I do
[02:31] <Finetundra> NeedSomeHelp, and you may wish to use the 14,04 as it has long term support
[02:31] <NeedSomeHelp> Finetundra: ok thanks, will try
[02:31] <bihaber> Bashing-om: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.failsafe in the folder
[02:31] <farva> and I have full access to everything
[02:31] <farva> but that one file removed the access
[02:31] <Bashing-om> bihaber: That is ok , just means that file does not exist .. continue on .
[02:31] <juddus> farva: root user, sudoer?
[02:32] <farva> as sftp, just a user with perms
[02:32] <samthewildone> Incompatible version of libgstreamer
[02:32] <juddus> ok
[02:32] <samthewildone> I just installed libgstreamer

[02:36] <bubbasaures> dawid90dd, #kubuntu
[02:36] <farva> yea...odd =[
[02:36] <juddus> farva: dont see why you cant open it
[02:36] <dawid90dd> on which server..
[02:37] <farva> it shows I have perms in the console
[02:37] <Finetundra> wastrel, and that should run it?
[02:37] <farva> but the sftp shows all dashes
[02:37] <bubbasaures> dawid90dd, freenode,
[02:37] <wastrel> i guess so :)
[02:37] <bubbasaures> same your on dawid90dd
[02:38] <juddus> farva: can u set perms in sftp?
[02:38] <Finetundra> wastrel, 'cause right now it doesn't do anything with that option selected
[02:38] <farva> nope
[02:38] <farva> console only I am sure
[02:38] <farva> how do I double check though?
[02:39] <juddus> right click the file in sftp
[02:39] <juddus> file permissions
[02:39] <juddus> etc
[02:39] <wastrel> Finetundra: it pops up a terminal for me that immediately exits
[02:40] <Finetundra> NeedSomeHelp, I'd also like to go on the record and say that ubuntu GNOME does NOT look like normal ubuntu by default. you'll have to add (do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop and then change the session) the unity desktop
[02:40] <Finetundra> wastrel, weird
[02:41] <farva> http://gyazo.com/f3ccf1f9fa41ad0783a5e257843526f0

[02:41] <farva> wait
[02:41] <farva> I got it
[02:41] <farva> I checked the wrong file on that screen shot
[02:41] <farva> it let me set perms though
[02:41] <farva> so its good
[02:42] <juddus> ok good
[02:42] <farva> weird that happened
[02:42] <juddus> multiple users via same sftp account can do that
[02:42] <farva> Thanks juddus <3
[02:42] <juddus> does he have a seperate user account?
[02:42] <juddus> on the server?

[03:01] <bazhang> step two, /join #winehq for support eddieftwlolz
[03:01] <eddieftwlolz> ok
[03:01] <k1l_> eddieftwlolz: since .exe is not meant to run on linux, your best chance is when wine supports it. if not, well, ask the one who makes the .exe to make a linux one

[04:06] <lacrymology> if I uninstall it, it works, but.. well, I'd like my drivers, you know
[04:06] <lacrymology> don't really know how to diagnose what's wrong exactly
[04:07] <Bashing-om> O_OniGiri: Sorry, no I was not directing to you .. I know nothing of Win8 or UEFI configs .
[04:07] <Bashing-om> !uefi | O_OniGiri
[04:07] <ubottu> O_OniGiri: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[04:08] <lacrymology> ah, wait. dmesg says "the nvidia gpu installed in this system is not supported by driver 331"
[04:08] <O_OniGiri> the problem is that grub isn't showing up
[04:09] <bihaber> Bashing-om: can't boot into system from grub. at one point i had a pretty user background after your fix but lost that.  i think my system is sot and i have to figure out how to salvage my files.  i'll NEVER do an Ubuntu upgrade again.
[04:09] <Bashing-om> O_OniGiri: Try: As soon as the bios screen clears press and hold the escape key . does the grub boot menu appear ?
[04:10] <O_OniGiri> Bashing-om going to try now
[04:11] <svetlana`> bihaber: from what to what version were you upgrading out of curiousity?
[04:11] <lacrymology> anyone knows why nvidia-319 depends on nvidia-331?
[04:12] <O_OniGiri> Bashing-om not working :k
[04:12] <Bashing-om> bihaber: Release upgrades when done properly are not a problem . The thing now is to fix this install .. One can always copy off files from a live(USB)/DVD .
[04:13] <O_OniGiri> Bashing-om during the installation of Ubuntu I recall that it didn't recognize the windows loader,  is that a problem?
[04:14] <bihaber> Bashing-om: where can i go from here? once gub is fixed i still have gui that doesn't work
[04:14] <Bashing-om> O_OniGiri: Sorry, I do not have the knowledge of Win8/UEFI to advise. Await others help .  And yes IF ubuntu did not recognize Windows, there is a problem ( Windows installed UEFI and ubuntu installed CCSM ??) .
[04:15] <Bashing-om> bihaber: If you can boot the operating system, then grub is functional and doing it's job . So the thing now is to find out why the GUI does not start .
[04:18] <bihaber> Bashing-om: grub isn't right. i have to pick ubuntu recovery and then pick a version to boot
[04:19] <bihaber> Bashing-om: i'm not even sure i'm getting the one we built. likely not because the gui doesn't work.
