[09:31] <linux_kid> ddude, these apps are kernel-specific, they must be installed for each kernel.  If this is a problem, stick with one kernel and only change for major releases.
[09:31] <profoX`> any idea why sudo or gdebi-gtk would do something like that? lock up my soundcard?
[09:31] <finn> can I manually run that on a already running system to detect new external drives and have the folders and mounts created?
