[16:10] <theadmin> Barcel0: Well, add "text" to this at the very end
[16:10] <awhitehatter> so my wireless card has decided to stop connecting to networks...I can see them, i try to connect it rejects the password. It's the right password, other devices connect just fine...I tried both Network-Manager and WICD, I get the same result. Any thoughts where to look next? Using BCM4312 card
[16:11] <bambu85> ActionParsnip: so that should be set to true? ok
[16:11] <ActionParsnip> bambu85: if you want to boot to CLI only then theadmin's advise will sort you
[16:11] <ActionParsnip> bambu85: read and think ;)
[16:11] <pconwell> does a combo cd/dvd drive show up differently in /dev/ depedning on if it's a cd or dvd in the drive?
[16:11] <pconwell> or is it always /dev/sr0 (or whatever(
[16:12] <theadmin> pconwell: Nah it's usually just srN where N is a number from 0 to infinity
[16:12] <bambu85> ActionParsnip: thanks!
[16:12] <urlin2u> awhitehatter, you have seen the broadcom wiki?
[16:12] <zykotick9> raj: regarding your aptitude question, have you seen -s simulate?
[16:12] <Barcel0>  theadmin , so? kernel /casper/vmlinuz  append  boot=casper  initrd=/casper/initrd.gz quiet splash  text
[16:12] <ActionParsnip> pconwell: if you put in a DVD then /dev/dvd will be used
[16:12] <pconwell> theadmin: thanks... I'm having issues with ddrescue
[16:13] <raj> zykotick9, no I haven't
[16:13] <theadmin> Barcel0: Something like this, I'm not familiar with syslinux actually
[16:13] <pconwell> ActionParsnip: as opposed to /dev/cdrom?
[16:13] <raj> I'll just use apt-get for now
[16:13] <ActionParsnip> pconwell: if you run:   sudo lshw -C disk; sudo lshw -C drive     you will see the device names
[16:13] <pconwell> ActionParsnip: cool
[16:13] <raj> I usually substitute aptitude for apt-get, and usually works
[16:13] <raj> but in this case it didn't
[16:13] <Barcel0> ok thank! theadmin :)
[16:13] <Barcel0> urlin2u, yes I use ubuntu

[16:15] <elijah> Looks like it is scp ~/{file1,file2} elijah@hostname.com:~/
[16:16] <pconwell> ActionParsnip: it shows up as "logical name: /dev/scd0" and the next line says "logical name: /dev/scd0". Is it normal to have two entries like that?
[16:18] <ActionParsnip> pconwell: maybe its a combi drive thing
[16:19] <bw_> Is there a preferred method of disabling services on boot? Create an service.override file or use chkconfig?
[16:20] <theadmin> bw_: err huh? chkconfig is a redhat thing, I have no idea what "service.override" is at all. Just use bum or rcconf
[16:20] <pconwell> ActionParsnip: yes it is, but both seem to work the same (as far as I can tell)...
[16:20] <zo1d> got a general question:  does anyone know if there is an interactive tutorial to learn C/C++ programming for linux?  want to learn so i can start working on learning how to update android kernels to 3.x from 2.6

[16:21] <kpas_> loop address
[16:21] <raj> in /etc/hosts
[16:21] <kpas_> in hosts file under etc
[16:21] <raj> it's listed for 'ubuntu'
[16:21] <bw_> theadmin: You can DL chkconfig from the repo. And the service.override is an upstart feature. All you do is place a file with manual in it /etc/init/ssh.override
[16:22] <mneptok> raj: the common loopback address for localhost
[16:22] <theadmin> bw_: Oh, I see, sorry, I wasn't aware.
[16:22] <raj> what does the loopback do?
[16:22] <zwoxyz> hello
[16:22] <mneptok> raj: it's how the machine talks to itself using TCP/IP, UDP or other network protocols
[16:22] <raj> also, some entries have two columns, some have 3, that's okay?
[16:22] <zwoxyz> What's the backtrack irc?
[16:22] <ActionParsnip> raj: loopback IP
[16:22] <ekaleido> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=loopback+address
[16:23] <ActionParsnip> raj: its how systems talk to services running on the same system
[16:23] <zwoxyz> backtrack linux irc channel?
[16:23] <mneptok> ekaleido: lmgtfy URLs are most unwelcome
[16:23] <raj> some are--> 127.0.0.1    localhost.localdomain   localhost

[16:24] <bw_> theadmin: no problem..were you recommending I edit rc*.d by hand?
[16:24] <raj> thank you
[16:25] <theadmin> bw_: Meh? I just do "sudo mv /etc/init/something.conf /etc/init/something.conf.DISABLED"
[16:25] <theadmin> bw_: Upstart ignores stuff not ending in conf so
[16:26] <satty> how to reset the screen brightness after login
[16:27] <theadmin> bw_: That, and, well, I myself don't use Upstart (or Ubuntu as such), but that's how I'd do it if I were
[16:27] <satty> every time i login it brightness is at maximum. I want this to as I want
=== matt_ is now known as Guest43216
[16:27] <bw_> theadmin: Not quite sure I understand you, but what do you mean?
[16:28] <artao> ubottu@satty: i just discovered grandr .. might that do it?
[16:28] <ubottu> artao: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[16:28] <theadmin> bw_: initscripts with Upstart are located under /etc/init/*.conf -- if the file doesn't end in .conf Upstart ignores it and doesn't start the respective service, so...

[16:39] <MonkeyDust> selite  how is your question ubuntu related?
[16:39] <selite> MonkeyDust: Shut your noisy hole, or answer my question.
[16:39] <sybariten> first i tried running thttpd. I wasnt too succesful i think. Then i realized apache is maybe already running on this host
[16:39] <theadmin> selite: Go to ##hardware , we don't support such things here.
[16:39] <newbie|3> see
[16:39] <lightpriest> selite, you should the connector on your laptop, they sometimes accept a range of voltages

[16:39] <newbie|3> i download it yestaday
[16:39] <ActionParsnip> lightpriest: run:  sudo lshw -C network; lsb_release -a; uname -a; sudo rfkill list     then use http://pastie.org   to host the output

[16:39] <newbie|3> but for somerearon i dont know how to make it work
[16:39] <sybariten> i checked with ps -aux and it seems like it was. Then i tried stopping it, and got it out of the ps result. But i still get a test page when pointing a browser to the host. What gives?

[16:58] <DXBLouie> how do i set ethernet speed in 11.10? i can run "ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full" at boot, but is there a way to get NetworkManager to do it?
[16:59] <awolfey> I'm trying to set up a vpn to the office win server. I have made a vpn connection but I can't figure out how to mount the drive. Google not giving much help. Do I use Connect to server from the file browser to do this?
[16:59] <artao> crap! I think i poochedmy system. Grub should come right up on boot, yes?
[16:59] <compdoc> DXBLouie, thats automatically done when the nic detects the switch
=== glebihan_ is now known as glebihan
[17:01] <DXBLouie> compdoc, i know.. i have gigabit switch and wiring, but on this box whenever the link is 1000mbps, it keeps going up and down, till i set the speed down to 100
[17:01] <DXBLouie> [67406.373042] r8169 0000:05:00.0: eth0: link down
[17:01] <DXBLouie> [67408.594268] r8169 0000:05:00.0: eth0: link up
[17:01] <jonko> channel is about ubuntu user support
[17:01] <artao> now my computer won't boot to win 7 OR linux. it's just sitting there blinking a cursor at me. ... I had my doubts about letting grub go on the MBR .. the installer didn't see my win 7, but i figured i could adjust that
[17:01] <zwoxyz> ActionParsnip: ok
[17:02] <MonkeyDust> can ethernet handle speeds of 1000mbps?
[17:02] <compdoc> DXBLouie, you have a problem with the nic, wiring, or switch. might be better to fix it, than manually setting the speed
[17:02] <jonko> its a the same but with nice gui
[17:02] <ActionParsnip> MonkeyDust: sure, as long as both ends support it
[17:02] <Spec> MonkeyDust: can ethernet handle gigabit? sure.
[17:02] <artao> soooo .. why won't grub load for me? i'm on my 1st reboot after install
[17:03] <DXBLouie> compdoc, the switch works fine, my windows box (identical) runs 1000mbps, i switched cables.. but that's besides the point
[17:03] <zwoxyz> ActionParsnip: Join BACKTRACK channel
[17:03] <ActionParsnip> artao: what GPU do you use?
[17:03] <artao> gpu? ati x600
[17:03] <DXBLouie> compdoc, at this point i'd much rather just set it to 100mbps.. the NIC is embedded, and my expansion PCIe ports are used
[17:03] <ActionParsnip> zwoxyz: done
[17:03] <jonko> tool artao ?
[17:03] <artao> ??
[17:03] <jonko> artao ?
[17:04] <DXBLouie> agian, that's besides the point, my question is really whether there's a way to set adapter options via NetworkManager, as opposed to setting an if-up script in /etc/network/interfaces and ditching NetworkManager
[17:04] <artao> i'm trying to get my comp. to boot ... grub won't start .. 1st boot after install
[17:04] <compdoc> DXBLouie, yeah, I often see bad onboard nics. No pci slots?
[17:04] <ActionParsnip> !nomodeset | artao
[17:04] <ubottu> artao: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[17:04] <GranCenSail> I installed Hardinfo and it has a lot of great information, but I still can't tell what my graphics card is or how to adjust the screen brightness.
[17:04] <DXBLouie> compdoc, two pci-e, one used with the video card, one used with a fax modem (fax server)
[17:04] <zykotick9> ActionParsnip: if artao isn't seen any grub, i'm not sure nomodeset will help (or is an option to set)
[17:05] <thegauntlet> Ubuntu 11.10 update manager just installed some updates, wanted to reboot and when it came back, every time i move the mouse, the screen goes black and then the login prompt appears. How can I fix?
[17:05] <ActionParsnip> zykotick9: the default is to not show grub though
[17:05] <artao> but the bootloader isn't even coming up .. i have no opportunity to use nomodeset
[17:05] <ActionParsnip> artao: hold shift at boot, does it show?
[17:05] <artao> i'll try
[17:06] <compdoc> DXBLouie, if you have to set the card manually, it might be best not to use the network manager. you can set everything by hand
[17:06] <ederico> hello all, I'm running Ubuntu 11.10. I was wondering, when I go to the music lens and click on a track it plays automatically in Totem. However, if I click on an album nothing happens. Is this normal, or is there a way I could get the whole album to play and be queued in Totem (or any other app)?
=== arun_ is now known as arunsonnet
[17:06] <artao> holding shift .. all i get is a blinking cursor in the upper left of the screen
=== mang0 is now known as Seryth
[17:06] <davidcalle> ederico, the Music lens is (by default) only working with Banshee.
[17:06] <artao> i think i pooched my MBR .. won't boot into win 7 either
[17:07] <zykotick9> !grub | artao
[17:07] <ubottu> artao: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[17:07] <auronandace> artao: how many harddrives do you have?
[17:07] <jonko> i have a ws which bought something, how can
[17:07] <zykotick9> artao: i'd try following the directions on restroing grub, sounds like it's not installed.
[17:08] <artao> 3 ... one sata (primary drive) one IDE, one USB external
[17:08] <davidcalle> ederico, that's why the albums don't play, Totems doesn't understand the concept of albums as Bansheed does.
[17:08] <davidcalle> Totem*
[17:08] <auronandace> artao: maybe you need to change the boot order in the bios
[17:08] <artao> i did that
[17:09] <auronandace> artao: so you are set to boot from the drive hat grub was installed to?
[17:09] <artao> that i'm not sure
=== cristiano is now known as Guest70057
[17:10] <artao> i let grub go to the MBR, assuming it was the SATA drive
[17:10] <auronandace> artao: trial and error, try booting from the other
[17:10] <artao> the IDE is set to boot 1st right now, but it also didn't work with the SATA booting 1st
[17:10] <auronandace> artao: ah, in that case i think zykotick9 might be right and grub didn't install
[17:11] <artao> hunh
[17:11] <artao> k
[17:12] <zykotick9> artao: are you using a cd or usb as a live medium?

[17:12] <jbs> cd ..

[17:14] <johndoe_> i was using unity-2d from the PPA
[17:14] <auronandace> johndoe_: tried removing the ppa to see if the issue persits?
[17:15] <becom33> Im having issue with opening a mysql port to the net , maby somthing is wrong with iptable . can any of you help ?
[17:15] <johndoe_> its not that easy
[17:15] <johndoe_> i cannot use the desktop

[17:15] <johndoe_> if I use the mouse it crashes
[17:15] <auronandace> johndoe_: perhaps you see now why ppas aren't supported
[17:16] <johndoe_> auronandace: thanks for being so helpful
[17:16] <becom33> anyone ?
[17:17] <Barcel0> you think this is correct/good?  append   boot=casper   initrd=/casper/initrd.gz autostart=serere --terminal single --
[17:17] <MonkeyDust> johndoe_  try ppa-purge
[17:17] <zykotick9> becom33: having a DB directly accessible from the net, isn't the greatest security idea.
[17:18] <auronandace> johndoe_: fun to learn the hard way eh? i'm just glad this isn't an issue of failing to make a backup (that lesson can hurt)
[17:18] <becom33> zykotick9: its local machine
[17:18] <jonko> to this even my name say it so why arent you telling me the whole thing about
[17:18] <johndoe_> MonkeyDust: thanks, is there an easy way to revert the packages also? or should I go and inspect them using aptitude?
[17:18] <Barcel0> ?
[17:19] <MonkeyDust> johndoe_  you mean downgrade? don't!
[17:19] <johndoe_> auronandace: theres nothing to learn here, I just want to know if anyone else is experiencing the bug
[17:19] <Barcel0> this line is good?  append   boot=casper   initrd=/casper/initrd.gz autostart=serere --terminal single --
[17:19] <Barcel0> for isolinux
[17:19] <johndoe_> MonkeyDust: yes, I mean downgrade
[17:19] <MonkeyDust> !downgrade > johndoe_
[17:19] <ubottu> johndoe_, please see my private message
[17:20] <zykotick9> johndoe_: downgrading doesn't work, the apt files involved are a one way process
[17:20] <raj> can someone please remind me how to add a user to the sudo group?
[17:20] <raj> or admin group
[17:20] <johndoe_> MonkeyDust: I dont think you are understanding
[17:20] <jonko> command can i run to install from a centos 6
[17:20] <ederico> davidcalle: Once we get Rhytmbox with 12.04 I guess that will play the albums, right?
[17:20] <jonko> can you provide more details ?
[17:20] <johndoe_> I mean reverting the packages to their old state
[17:21] <johndoe_> its not a problem with unity though
[17:21] <zykotick9> johndoe_: you'll need to remove the affected packages, then reinstall them fresh.
[17:21] <jonko> you with that i'll have to be a hybrid iso

[17:21] <johndoe_> the problem is with the latest X upgrades
[17:21] <auronandace> jonko: why are you asking about centos in #ubuntu?
[17:21] <gadeynebram_> When I boot my laptop my screen remains blank
[17:22] <jonko> to boot
[17:22] <davidcalle> ederico, yes.

[17:22] <ederico> davidcalle: thanks for your explanation :)

[17:23] <davidcalle> ederico, if you want to use an other music player with the music lens, it's still possible with a PPA. What music player are you using?
[17:23] <meerkats> hear me!!!
[17:24] <auronandace> johndoe_: latest X upgrades? are you using a xorg ppa?
[17:24] <ederico> davidcalle: I currently enjoy using xnoise, as it is lightweight

[17:24] <davidcalle> meerkats, hi
[17:24] <johndoe_> auronandace: but I tried with lightdm, gdm, kdm and even though I can login
[17:24] <johndoe_> the desktop crashes
[17:25] <johndoe_> when I move or click with the mouse
[17:25] <davidcalle> ederico, then no. It only supports rhythmbox, gmusicbrowser, guayadeque and clementine.
[17:25] <johndoe_> and the login screen reappears

[17:36] <Nach0z> goldcityman: you could theoretically re-nice the plugin-container, but auronandace is right, installing LXDE instead of Gnome is a much better option
[17:36] <theadmin> goldcityman: Try Xubuntu or Lubuntu, or maybe Crunchbang or even Arch. We don't support the latter two, but they have brilliant performance :)
[17:37] <oldman> Does ubuntu support HID (usb) compliant touchscreens?
[17:37] <ActionParsnip> goldcityman: sure, minimum requirement is still 512Mb, you will get a more responsive OS with Lubuntu
[17:38] <theadmin> oldman: Yes, Ubuntu does have touchscreen support iirc
[17:38] <goldcityman> what version?
[17:38] <goldcityman> last?

[17:39] <Zilly> Is there a way to get which input the monitor is displaying (like whether it is displaying from the VGA port or the HDMI)?
[17:39] <ActionParsnip> metbsd: you can install minimal ubuntu which will give a CLI based OS...
[17:39] <MonkeyDust> metbsd  ubuntu server
[17:39] <goldcityman> can I upgrade from ubuntu 9.10 or I have to format?
[17:39] <auronandace> !mini | metbsd
[17:39] <ubottu> metbsd: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[17:40] <theadmin> goldcityman: You can only upgrade to 10.04, then to 10.10, then to 11.04 and finally to 11.10. Which is a horrible mess. I suggest a reinstall.

[17:50] <rohit__> I have ubuntu 10.10 and suse 12.1 running on my laptop ! i get good internet speed on ubuntu 1mbps,but on suse i only get 30bps or something like that
[17:50] <zykotic10> johndoe_: if the bug is with a PPA, be sure to report it to the PPA - not Ubuntu

[17:51] <DummyMode> is there a way to upgrade to a new release without reinstalling? for example, from 10 to 12, just to say something..
[17:51] <theadmin> scott__: Add the ppa, install the package. To add the ppa, use something like this: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:username/repo (e.g: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-next)

[17:51] <Mixxit> hey is there a way i can snap to right side like windows 7

[17:52] <theadmin> rohit__: Disable IPv6, also please go to #suse
[17:52] <xangua> DummyMode: you can upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 as both are LTS
[17:52] <MonkeyDust> Mixxit  no, but there is a PPA to snap to the bottom
[17:52] <ActionParsnip> Mixxit: its the grid plugin in ccsm

[17:56] <TheExplorer> Greetings fellow ubuntu users, I have a 2 quick questions: firstly i backed up my old harddrive in a single *.tar.gz format, attempting to open the file and extract it is EXTREMELY slow, is there any way to write an index to speed up the process?
[17:56] <Mixxit> do you mean the bindings? i see put bottom left
[17:56] <Mixxit> if so what is KP8 etc?
[17:56] <ActionParsnip> Mixxit: you configure it there dude, have a play
[17:56] <theadmin> TheExplorer: You don't have to open it to extract, you can use the command-line
=== Nunux is now known as Putx
[17:57] <scott__> actionparsnip: please go to the page i've linked, and find the link to the package, then come tell me where to click. i know it sounds rather acedemic, but the link escapes me
[17:57] <ActionParsnip> scott__: there is nothing to 'click' you need the command I ave
[17:57] <ActionParsnip> *gave
[17:57] <TheExplorer> Dear "theadmin", the file is so big that i cannot extract it at once for a lack of space. I wish to recover select files.
[17:58] <theadmin> TheExplorer: Ah, I see, uh, I think the tar command has some option for that, just a sec
[17:58] <jonko> to see if the issue persits ?
[17:58] <Mixxit> hmm doesnt seme to be doing anything
[17:58] <jonko> might be better to fix it, than manually setting the speed
[17:58] <ActionParsnip> scott__: all you have to do is copy and paste the command I gave and it will install the app...
[17:59] <ActionParsnip> scott__: no idea where you go the idea you click something
[17:59] <TheExplorer> Secondly does anyone know of an "all in one" file explorer, or know of how i would go about setting nautilus to do that. I wish to view all files without folders to recover scattered various documents.
[17:59] <theadmin> TheExplorer: Well to get the list of files all over your hard drive, you can do this: sudo find / | less
[17:59] <MonkeyDust> TheExplorer  try midnight commander
[17:59] <jonko> MonkeyDust : ok

[18:01] <scott__> actionparsnip: i have tried the normal input. and gotten back something about it being outdated so on, should i try it again and give you a concise output? this isn't my first time installing from a PPA. i'm just at a loss as to why i can't get the package in this casse
[18:02] <TheExplorer> Gentoo64, I... being the unorganized sort i am, end up saving files to random places for whatever reason. Because i have no single folder that i save my documents in, they are scattered deep in a 15 years worth of sloppy backups and random dirs.
[18:02] <libnotify> i know what spamming is, get a clue
[18:02] <libnotify> ok outta here have important things to do right now

[18:54] <grubbyone> I will probably mess things up quite a bit
[18:54] <ActionParsnip> grubbyone: you can reinstate grub from livecd
[18:55] <ubukou> ActionParsnip, kde is really good..
[18:56] <zykotick9> grubbyone: learning to fix issues, rather then reinstalling - is the first step to getting a lot better on gnu/linux
[18:56] <ubukou> ActionParsnip,  takes me a little time to find things but better that unity
[18:56] <ActionParsnip> ubukou: its good to try new things :)
[18:56] <grubbyone> I know, I just want the option, in case I suspect the machine has been compromised
[18:57] <ubukou> ActionParsnip, that depends.

[18:57] <ubukou> folks what is the command to see what drivers your VGA is running ?
[18:58] <ActionParsnip> ubukou: sudo lshw -C display | grep driver
[18:58] <ubukou> ActionParsnip, cool.. im having an issue with compiz.. it runs but it is very choppy..
[18:59] <zykotick9> ubukou: if you don't have lshw installed, you can use "lspci -vnvn" then find the VGA section, OR check /var/log/Xorg.0.log

[19:00] <ubukou> ActionParsnip, configuration: driver=fglrx_pci latency=0
[19:00] <grubbyone> is there a built in tool to zero out free space?
[19:00] <ubukou> ActionParsnip, i dont think that was it.. there is a command that gives another output..
[19:00] <ActionParsnip> grubbyone: use dd
[19:01] <ActionParsnip> ubukou: then you are using the proprietary driver
[19:01] <ubukou> ActionParsnip, hmmmm..
[19:01] <zykotick9> grubbyone: ActionParsnip's dd command would be for an empty partition, not just free space on an active partition
[19:02] <ActionParsnip> grubbyone: i believe bleachbit can do it
[19:02] <grubbyone> ok, basically I just want to make a direct copy of an entire disk, but not have it take up 120 gigs, so I want to compress what's not in use
[19:02] <surskitty> my kernel logs are between 1.3gb to 1.7gb each and this is only for a span of about two weeks.  apparently the workaround I found to get my wireless card gets it so it logs multiple times a second that the wireless card exists.  how do I get it to not do that?
[19:02] <DinoMuffin> grubbyone: it would help to know why you would need to do this
[19:02] <ActionParsnip> grubbyone: partimage can make a disk image and compress it
=== cookiecache is now known as buck_
[19:03] <surskitty> better yet, just get the log to NOT SAY THE SAME THING A BILLION TIMES
[19:03] <grubbyone> so if I'm on the other side of the world, I can tell someone to "insert this usb stick and type this command" to restore the system
[19:04] <ActionParsnip> grubbyone: sure, why not?
[19:04] <zykotick9> grubbyone: you "might" want to check out the clonezilla livecd
[19:05] <Mixxit> hey all
[19:05] <reisio> grubbyone: but depending on what device/configuration they have, including the mbr could be unhelpful :p
[19:05] <Mixxit> most stuff is working now but wondering about my g15 keyboard
=== buck_ is now known as cookiecache
[19:05] <Mixxit> how can i get this going i found an article on the wiki but its for ubuntu 9
[19:06] <grubbyone> it's the same system, I'm not restoring the image to a different system
[19:06]  * zykotick9 thinks drive image backups are a waste of space, save config files and personal documents - reinstall then replace configs and files
[19:06] <reisio> grubbyone: honestly just make a tar of the unmounted system, and include a script or instructions to install/reconfig the partitions, filesystems, and grub
[19:07] <xcyclist> As of my most recent login, my audio has stopped working on my 11.10 64 bit system.  It was working find yesterday.  The output setting always says "Dummy".

[19:08] <Mixxit> they do
[19:08] <jonko> donating to be run securely on smart cards and similar ActionParsnip devices
[19:08] <grubbyone_> is it not way simpler to just do dd if=/restore.img of=/dev/hda
[19:08] <Mixxit> oh wow it just skipped my track
[19:08] <ActionParsnip> Mixxit: then use either ccsm or the keyboard settings to assign commands to them

=== andre__ is now known as Guest58686
[19:10] <holstein> ubukou: should be similar.. depends on where you got it, but you can just remove the driver... uninstall
[19:11] <zykotick9> grubbyone_: hda?  What is it 2001 again ;)
[19:11] <xcyclist> Hopping back out.  Looks like the group is way too busy today.
[19:11] <ubukou> holstein, will that activate the opensource driver automaticaly?
[19:11] <grubbyone_> zykotick9: yeah I don't know, please enlighten me
[19:11] <grubbyone_> last time I did this stuff was probably 2001
[19:11] <zykotick9> grubbyone_: everything should be sda these days
[19:11] <holstein> ubukou: the open one didnt go anywhere.. again, it depends on which driver and how you installed it...
[19:11] <grubbyone_> ah yeah, that's what I meant
[19:12] <zykotick9> grubbyone_: even IDE drives should show as SCSI (sd) i mean
[19:12] <jonko> universzykotick9l ide with super powers yeah
[19:12] <ubukou> holstein, i activated the fglrx driver in ubuntu but i swiched to kde
[19:12] <ubukou> holstein, thing is i am running compiz successfully
[19:12] <jonko> hmm, one more thing
[19:13] <holstein> ubukou: cool.. you can just uninstall it as you choose...
[19:13] <ubukou> holstein, but it is really choppy and it freezes a lot
[19:13] <holstein> ubukou: yeah, just depends on what driver and where you got it from
[19:13] <ubukou> holstein, should i boot unity and go deactivate it from there?
[19:13] <holstein> sometiems you can get newer ones from the site
[19:13] <jonko> i don't get better when you reboot, the free encyclopedia
[19:13] <holstein> ubukou: you can.. however you want... that will remever the driver as i am suggesting

[19:43] <ubukou> anybody knows the proper way to remove the ati driver and re-enable the open source driver? i used   sudo apt-get remove --purge xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx* and it resulted in failure.. had to reanable  it so i could boot gui..
[19:45] <zykotick9> ubukou: (just a guess), but after you remove the ATI driver, you probably have to move xorg.conf to a different name.
[19:45] <ubukou> zykotick9, hmm you think xorg.conf was trying to load fglrx?
[19:46] <zykotick9> ubukou: yes i do
[19:46] <ubukou> zykotick9, any reconfigure commands?
[19:47] <zykotick9> ubukou: just move it to a different name, xorg shouldn't be required for "open" drivers (ATI's open driver still relies on proprietary firmware - so i don't consider it open)
[19:47] <GiB_> Understandable, I was just reading the rules and it said something about topics. Anyways, recently got my computer today, installed compiz via the terminal. Since then when I log in using the 3D version the I no longer have a side dock or functionallity of top bar. At this point, seeing as how I have no data on this system yet, I would like to revert it back to its fresh out the box state.

[19:49] <ActionParsnip> damo22: uninstall unused kernels to free up space
[19:49] <ActionParsnip> damo22: run it with sudo.
[19:49] <ubukou> zykotick9, according to some folks over at #ati it does..
[19:49] <damo22> i dont have access to an account with admin rights

[19:50] <ActionParsnip> damo22: you can add the command to the sudoers file, it will not need password for sudo (you may need to still be in the admin group)

[20:29] <ubukou> mellifera, hmmm intel ? onboard?
[20:29] <ubukou> tbocs, intel onboard?
[20:30] <tbocs> ubukou, some computers has intel graphics card and a dedicated card at the same time
[20:30] <tbocs> right?
[20:30] <ubukou> tbocs, lspci | grep radeon gives no output...
[20:30] <tbocs> ubukou, then lspci | grep Radeon
[20:30] <tbocs> it's case sensitive, lol
[20:31] <ubukou> sudo lshw -C display | grep driver gives fglrx..
[20:31] <ubukou> but i just purged it and installed mesa.

[20:32] <ubukou> tbocs, i didnt get the R the first time ..
[20:32] <mellifera> ubukou: if you want to be sure you are using the radeon driver, you could specify that in your xorg config file (in /etc/x11)

[20:39] <zykotick9> mellifera: if it's a text file, yes.  The newlines are handled differently.
[20:40] <mellifera> zykotick9: what if it's not a text file?
[20:40] <zykotick9> mellifera: they "should" be the same
[20:40] <pirat> how a you?
[20:41] <zykotick9> pirat: do you have an ubuntu support question?
[20:41] <theadmin> mellifera: Nah they're the same, but Windows doesn't like Unicode so if the name is, say, Cyrillic Windows might display it as some complete mess. Same goes for text file content.
[20:43] <theadmin> raj: wgetpaste also works well.

[20:44] <Guest63529> hello. When I turn on my laptop running Ubuntu it says *starting MTA
[20:44] <Guest63529> Does that mean Mail transfer agent?
[20:44] <mellifera> usually
[20:44] <Guest63529> mellifera: I never installed any MTA
[20:44] <ubukou> auronandace, seems like when ubuntu is about to start it turns off  both screens and it stays there .. only thing that make the gui boot is apt-get install fglrx*
[20:44] <Guest63529> mellifera: how do I turn it off and why does it say now
[20:44] <Guest63529> when it never said it before.
[20:45] <TGIBT> I managed to install with nomodeset... I do get same problem with graphic driver when i just restart... Any solutions?
[20:45] <mellifera> "sendmail" counts as a MTA, and it's sort of needed
[20:45] <alexdevillx> Hi guys
[20:45] <auronandace> ubukou: when you say gui are you refering to any specific desktop? or does it not even make it to lightdm?
[20:46] <alexdevillx> I have a problem i dont know english well so can anybody give me an answer why i get this error  (voice_nitech_us_slt_arctic_hts) Error: HTS_Model_load_pdf: Failed to load header of pdfs.
[20:47] <mellifera> alexdevillx: are you sure it's really a pdf file, and not just called ".pdf"?
[20:47] <ubukou> auronandace, nope... :S
[20:47] <r3d0ctob3r> Hi guys ! I have a problem with my "apt-get"... And a old proxy I got. I deleted it, clean my /etc/apt/apt.conf file... and the console keep saying I cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:8118. Nobody knows about it please ?
[20:48] <ubukou> auronandace, it should at least crash trying to load lightdm right ? instead screens go out of range.
[20:48] <auronandace> ubukou: so you can't even get to the login manager?
[20:48] <zykotick9> mellifera: the error appears to be in connection with Festival, not PDFs
[20:48] <ubukou> auronandace, right
[20:48] <theadmin> r3d0ctob3r: Check the gnome's proxy settings as well as the $PROXY variable
[20:48] <auronandace> ubukou: wow, thats bad

[20:48] <auronandace> ubukou: seems like you're stuck with using fglrx
[20:49] <mellifera> r3d0ctob3r: 127.0.0.1 should be your loopback interface, and should work on any port if your networking is configured correctly

[20:55] <xj88> Hello all, and thanks to everyone who hangs out here, helping. I'm having some issues with a new install of 11.10. It installs without problem, but upon logging in, all I get is the desktop image and a cursor. Nothing else loads. I CTRL+ALT+F2'd my way into a terminal and upgraded all packages, so I should be completely up to date. Going into "Ubuntu 2D" works but isn't what I need. Any thoughts?

[20:56] <lorenzo> hi, i am following this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router to set my ubuntu machine as a router. One thing I do not understand: when I set the internal network interface (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router#Configuring_the_Internal_Network_Interfaces) what addresses should I put in? Thanks
[20:56] <alexdevillx> theadmin, Hello There
[20:56] <theadmin> alexdevillx: Uh, hi.
[20:56] <xj88> theadmin: How to get it?
[20:57] <alexdevillx> theadmin< Ok, so i'll give a link with instructions http://glados.biringa.com/ go to the how the voice is generated.

[20:57] <theadmin> xj88: Log in to unity2d and from there search for an app called "Hardware Drivers". Run that, it should find the appropriate ones.
[20:57] <mellifera> lorenzo: your "inside" address, like (for example) 10.0.0.1
[20:57] <xj88> theadmin: I'll give that a shot. Regardless of whether or not it works, thanks for helping. =)
[20:58] <lorenzo> the one I get from iwconfig ath0 (ath0 is my internal network interface)
[20:59] <theadmin> alexdevillx: I'm not familiar with speech synthesis honestly -- I just gave you a possible solution. I have no idea how to work it
[20:59] <lorenzo> mellifera, I have an address for my cabled connection going to the outside (eth0), but I cannot see any address for ath0 which is my internal network interface
[20:59] <r3d0ctob3r> I ask my question again : I installed Privoxy few weeks ago, then uninstalled it. It seems to change my network settings... When I run a "apt-get update", I'm said that He cant download from 127.0.0.1:8118 ; however I uninstalled this proxy server, I changed my setting from system preference (dirrect connection to internet), /etc/apt/apt.conf is empty . What is going wrong ?
[20:59] <mellifera> lorenzo: if your outside interface is eth0, your inside interface would be eth1
