[02:31] <t4ken> am i wrong
[02:31] <cherwin> t4ken: ok just do a dmesg, and search for the harddrive that you wish to mount
[02:31] <t4ken> i know which hard drive i want to mount
[02:31] <PaulCbu> i figured it was ralink based on the ndiswrapper list

[02:37] <sysdoc> t4ken, once you set up the mount points in fstab they will auto mount at startup

[04:51] <jhoover> chetwin: flash 8 for linux is not out
[04:51] <eugman> Is there a way to do a ctrl+alt+backspace equivalent though terminal commands?
[04:51] <Chetwin> That's gotta be what it is

[04:52] <eugman> Ro1, It's probably a config file and you didn't open it up as root.

[04:53] <Ro1> i'm making a file and trying to save it in a modprobe.d directory...but it says i dont have permission
=== thewolf wonders why his simple question remains unanswered for nearly 45 minutes...
[04:53] <WebWiz> I am trying to install ubuntu LTS 6.06 and its hanging at 15% saying Creating ext3 file system for / partition #1 of SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda)
[04:53] <alex_> i'm new in that

[04:53] <eugman> Ro1, you don't. You have to open gedit or whatever you use as root if you want to save in system critical areas like that.
[04:53] <mikeLaptop> neighborlee, full screen
[04:53] <thewolf> Thats one hell of a long time to stare at text-mode IRC hoping someone has the answer
[04:53] <sysdoc> mikeLaptop, I think that your problem is in the nvidia driver cause the suspend is not handled in the driver

[04:54] <eugman> gksudo gedit in the terminal will do the trick.
[04:54] <alex_> what hall is that?
[04:54] <alex_> is a chat of nerds?
[04:54] <neighborlee> mikeLaptop, no wonder
[04:54] <mikeLaptop> neighborlee, ??
[04:54] <WebWiz> is there an install log for the gui installer
[04:54] <newbuntu> delete the folders it makes like .wine before you reinstall
[04:54] <WebWiz> so i know where its hanging
[04:54] <neighborlee> mikeLaptop, how did you install the nvidia driver
=== J-_ shutters, wine sucks =P
[04:55] <mikeLaptop> neighborlee, i used the binary in the non-free repo
[04:55] <eugman> J- , You get what you pay for?
[04:55] <ChrisC_> I just upgraded from breezy to dapper, and my beloved Mozilla (not Firefox) is gone.  How can I restore it so that it uses my old profile? (which has a gazillion cookie prefs in it)
[04:55] <neighborlee> mikeLaptop, and you issued the command at shell afterwards ?

At startup and shutdown splash screens, the screen flashes in the right resolution then goes all weird, with the left side of the screen cut off. Anyone have any idea how to fix this?
[05:03] <thewolf> niki, untwisted: I wish you where here before, thanks
