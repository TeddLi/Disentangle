[09:14] <Wulframn> logical_: there will still be a filesystem on it. Just because you deleted the files doesn't mean you deleted the filesystem.
[09:14] <cynicallemon> rwsq1: we i feel we are all a victim of the "linux is secure" syndrome
[09:15] <logical_> Wulframn seems like you dont understand me,  forget what is on the usb, i just want to change the label of the usb, the name of the usb,  like if it was called USB1 i want to rename it to logicals usb...
[09:15] <Wulframn> cynicallemon: it's because that's what the fanboys tout as one of its primary advantages.
[09:15] <cynicallemon> wait until systemd becomes the #1 attack vector
[09:15] <rwsq1> cynicallemon, I think the point is that everything is out in the open
[09:16] <Wulframn> logical_: Your ability to change the USB's label depends on the filesystem type on the USB.
[09:16] <logical_> wulframn it is fat32
[09:16] <cynicallemon> i like the fact that openbsd chroots their own httpd server by default
[09:16] <Wulframn> logical_: thank you, just a moment
[09:16] <rwsq1> this is by far the worst bug I've encountered in 14 years, and it's been sorted out reasonably efficiently, and it's actually probably not as severe as first thought. But the point is we can all see what's happening. If it was a bug in OSX or Windows we woudln't know what was going on until there was an update.
[09:17] <rwsq1> zundrli, I am using such a setup
[09:17] <Wulframn> logical_: do you know the USB's location? If not please use fdisk -l
[09:17] <zundrli> do you have the same problem rwsql
[09:17] <rwsq1> not as far as I can see
[09:17] <rwsq1> are your monitors of identical resolution?
[09:17] <p0a> Hello I have a netbook here with ubuntu installed but the person who is using it does not know the password
[09:17] <p0a> the username is 'user'
[09:18] <p0a> can someone guess what the password is? The person is computer illiterate and he bought the computer
[09:18] <zundrli> no one is 1920x1080 (monitor1) and 1280x1024 (monitor2)
[09:18] <rwsq1> p0a have you tried booting into single user mode?
[09:18] <rwsq1> I guess that's your problem zundrli
[09:18] <p0a> rwsq1: What do you mean by that?
[09:18] <Wulframn> p0a: No we can't, but we can help you setup a new password.
[09:18] <Ben64> !lostpassword | p0a
[09:18] <ubottu> p0a: Forgot your password? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal.

[09:19] <zundrli> rwsql its fine for twitch.tv but not for youtube
[09:19] <cynicallemon> rwsq1: as u state being in the open, linux has been "secure" by obscurity, not so obscure anymore
[09:19] <Wulframn> logical_: you need /dev/sdb1 (or something like that)
[09:19] <p0a> Ben64: thank you
[09:20] <EriC^^> logical_: go to the dash > type disks, select your disk, click on the partition, click the gear icon, select edit filesystem > edit the label
[09:21] <logical_> wulframn it is /dev/sdb1
[09:21] <rwsq1> p0a if you reboot, at the grub prompt you should get a recovery mode option
[09:21] <Wulframn> logical_: sudo mlabel -i /dev/sdb1 -s ::"<new label> "
[09:22] <Wulframn> Or do what EriC^^ said
[09:22] <rwsq1> p0a to get into grub prompt hold shift key while booting

[09:24] <rwsq1> cynicallemon, quite the opposite - it's closed source which is secure by being obscure

[09:26] <tdn> I have just installed 12.04 amd 64. I cannot start any virtualbox machines. I have tried reinstalling virtualbox packages, but it does not help. This is the error I see: http://paste.yt/p3183.html    What to do?
[09:26] <p0a> I was not prompted to grub\
[09:26] <p0a> to log in into a root shell
[09:26] <bloopletech> I have a UEFI-enabled machine with Windows 8.1 installed; I've repartitioned, installed 14.04 etc, but Ubuntu only boots if the BIOS is set to Legacy mode, and then the Grub screen doesn't show windows. I hae installed refind in an attempt to fix this, but it hasn't helped
[09:26] <tdn> Note, I already installed build-essential and headers
[09:26] <p0a> !changepassword | p0a
[09:27] <bloopletech> and now there are refind files in my /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot directory, which I don't think is right
[09:27] <p0a> Can someone help with changing the password? I have physical access to the notebook
[09:27] <tnli> I've a question, I have 14.04 and use the Swe-kb layout, but on each boot, it starts with english, and then after a while it switches to Swe/Fi. What's up with this?
[09:27] <cynicallemon> tdn: yeah you need linux-headers
[09:27] <p0a> Ben64: I think you linked me before. Can you plese likn me again
[09:27] <tdn> cynicallemon, I already installed linux-headeres-generic
[09:28] <Wulframn> !lostpassword | p0a

[09:28] <rwsq1> p0a does the grub prompt come up at boot if you hold down shift or ctrl (I forget which)
[09:28] <EriC^^> bloopletech: what happens if you boot using uefi?
[09:28] <p0a> rwsq1: the grub prompt does not come up at all
[09:28] <bloopletech> also I'm confused, as windows itself seems to present windows and ubuntu as boot options; in that case, do I need something like refind at all?
[09:28] <p0a> Wulframn: thanks. but all these methods requrie the grub prompt, which I do not ge
[09:28] <p0a> get
[09:28] <Bolt_Thrower138> word
[09:28] <bloopletech> EriC^^, a windows boot menu comes up
=== zenx is now known as Guest72014
[09:29] <EriC^^> windows boot menu?
[09:29] <bloopletech> if I then select windows, it boots fine; if I select ubuntu, it just reboots
[09:29] <EriC^^> bloopletech: did you install using wubi?
[09:29] <Wulframn> p0a: slap a live cd in there, mount and chmod into your existing environment and change the password that way.
[09:29] <rwsq1> p0a try repeatedly pressing ctrl from boot
[09:29] <p0a> Wulframn: don't have one...
[09:29] <cynicallemon> tdn: "Consult /var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/4.1.12/build/make.log for more information." - have you done that?
[09:29] <p0a> rwsq1: I will try once more
[09:29] <bloopletech> EriC^^, I asked the guy who installed ubuntu, he says a livecd
[09:30] <tdn> cynicallemon, yes. Will paste it. I have no clue as to what it means.
[09:30] <EriC^^> ok
[09:30] <bloopletech> He turned UEFI off to install
[09:30] <rwsq1> you could also try ctrl-x - I think that used to be the hotkey - which version of ubuntu is this?
[09:30] <bloopletech> which explains why ubuntu only works in legacy mode
[09:30] <EriC^^> bloopletech: ah, well that's your problem
[09:30] <p0a> rwsq1: some people recommend changing /etc/default/grub on some forums, but I can't do that without the root password
[09:30] <EriC^^> bloopletech: reinstall with uefi turned on
[09:30] <quiet1> hi, can some point me to instructions for installing on an existing lvm partition on an encrypted disk?
[09:30] <bloopletech> I am vaguely aware of all this uefi stuff but avoided it till now
[09:30] <bloopletech> I have to reinstall?
[09:30] <tdn> cynicallemon, http://paste.yt/p3184.html
[09:30] <Wulframn> p0a: you have access to another system apparently. Better yet, it seems to have internet access. Download and burn one if it comes to that.
[09:30] <EriC^^> bloopletech: i think so, yes
[09:30] <p0a> Wulframn: I hve to do this in 10 minutes or less
[09:30] <bloopletech> sigh ok
[09:30] <EriC^^> bloopletech: do you have a livecd?
[09:30] <rwsq1> p0a indeed - you need to boot into recovery mode - it really shold be possible
[09:31] <p0a> rwsq1: I will try
[09:31] <bloopletech> I've got an iso, can probably burn it to a usb
[09:31] <quiet1> s/some/someone
[09:31] <p0a> rwsq1: hopefully I wont be back :P if it works
[09:31] <rwsq1> unless someone installed this machine with lilo or anoter bootloader
[09:31] <bloopletech> the other thing is, those refind files in the windows boot menu, is it safe to leave them around?
[09:31] <EriC^^> bloopletech: i have no idea what refind is
[09:32] <bloopletech> EriC^^, this thing: http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/
[09:32] <Wulframn> rwsq1: I'm more worried about them needing to do it in ten minutes or less. Sounds shady
[09:32] <dbugger> Hey guys. How can I execute from an script, another script that is stored in an URL
[09:32] <dbugger> ?
[09:32] <bloopletech> basically an efi boot manager... but apparently windows has one? at least a windows 8-style OS chooser gui showed
[09:32] <cynicallemon> tdn: i assume you updated packages first before installing virtualbox
[09:33] <tdn> cynicallemon, yes. Everything is up to date.
[09:33] <EriC^^> bloopletech: ok
[09:33] <rwsq1> Wulframn, yeah but that's not a software issue :)
[09:33] <bloopletech> man I dunno, I'm going to do a boot repair or whatever within windows and then reinstall ubuntu
[09:34] <EriC^^> bloopletech: yeah that's probably best
[09:34] <cynicallemon> tdn: it looks like some mismatch between virtualbox driver and kernel header file at a guess
[09:35] <cynicallemon> tdn: i would ask in ubuntu forums and virtualbox forums
[09:36] <varunendra> dbugger, wget then execute?
[09:37] <rwsq1> tdn - is your current running kernel 3.13.0-36-generic  ?
[09:37] <EriC^^> dbugger: bash <(curl -s http://script)
[09:38] <rwsq1> tdn can you paste somewhere the make log?
[09:38] <Wulframn> Welcome back buh
[09:38] <Wulframn> buharin: any luck?
[09:38] <dbugger> varunendra: how to script it, without leaving residual files?
[09:38] <buharin> Wulframn, I uinstalled network manager and all go sux
[09:38] <buharin> ;d
[09:39] <buharin> maybe I will install new ubuntu
[09:39] <buharin> instead elementary os
[09:39] <johncarper> what would be the ports that xrdp uses? i didn't had my ufw firewall enabled on startup on my ubuntu server and now i enabled it i can't connect with rdp anymore
[09:39] <johncarper> i wonder what the ports are so i can allow
[09:40] <Wulframn> buharin: run ifconfig -a, what do you see?
[09:40] <bumbar_> does anyone know if there's a solution/fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gedit/+bug/1057165 ?
[09:40] <buharin> only wlan0 and lo

[09:40] <varunendra> dbugger, just put the 'wget <options> <online script>', then "./<downloaded script>" lines in your existing script.
[09:40] <EriC^^> dbugger: that won't save anything, and it won't output any errors
[09:40] <Wulframn> buharin: run "sudo ifup eth0"
[09:41] <dbugger> EriC^^: I kinda want the error output
[09:41] <buharin> cannot find device
[09:41] <Wulframn> buharin: yeah, was prepared for that. One moment
[09:41] <Ben64> buharin: are you on elementaryos?
[09:41] <buharin> ye
[09:41] <Ben64> then you should head to the support channel for that distro
[09:41] <rwsq1> tdn sorry I see the make log - I think you might need to get a newer virtualbox
[09:41] <buharin> but it is ubuntu :P also
[09:42] <Ben64> it isn't ubuntu
[09:42] <EriC^^> dbugger: bash <(curl -Ss http://script)
[09:42] <rwsq1> tdn, download the latest 4.3.x from virtualbox site
[09:42] <buharin> Ben64, but ok I preapring new ubuntu pendrive
[09:42] <varunendra> dbugger, if you don't want the downloaded script, simply add another line (rm <script>) to remove it afterwards. Reading, downloading equal things I think.
[09:42] <EriC^^> dbugger: that will show errors, but won't show any progress meters, etc.
[09:42] <Ben64> !elementary | buharin
[09:42] <ubottu> buharin: Elementary OS is an Ubuntu derivative which is supported in their IRC channel #elementary on irc.freenode.net - http://elementaryos.org/ for more information on this distribution.

[09:43] <buharin> Wulframn, yeah because I think it wont work but anyway it is customized ubuntu 12.04
[09:43] <buharin> I got hp probook there
[09:44] <Wulframn> buharin: Once you install ubuntu give it a try and let us know. If eth0 still isn't configured it should be an easy fix.
[09:44] <Wulframn> *should*
[09:44] <buharin> Wulframn, but you know how to fix it?
[09:44] <buharin> Wulframn, it is ubuntu 12.04 now
[09:45] <Ben64> buharin: stop saying it is ubuntu, it is not
[09:45] <buharin> -.-
[09:45] <Wulframn> buharin: I thought you just said you were running elementaryos
[09:45] <buharin> yep
[09:45] <Wulframn> Ubuntu derivatives are not Ubuntu
[09:45] <buharin> oh ok

[09:46] <Wulframn> Derivatives are downstream, meaning they have more stuff in them meaning they have bugs are not familiar with and are not prepared for
[09:46] <tdn> rwsq1, the one that is available from apt-get should work with the kernel that is available from packages, right?
[09:47] <rwsq1> tdn you would think so, but I think there was an issue with some of the 4.2 virtualbox releases
[09:48] <rwsq1> I would head straight for the virtualbox site for the latest version
[09:49] <Ben64> i'd recommend using a PPA over downloading software from the site
[09:50] <jargon> if i enable the root account and delete the user account, and reboot, will the login prompt be for the root account?
[09:51] <Ben64> jargon: don't
[09:52] <jargon> Ben64: that doesn't exactly answer my question :-/
[09:52] <Ben64> its a terrible idea, won't work and its also a bad idea
[09:52] <_blk> jargon, not in the graphical selection. Not sure about lightdm (ubuntu default), but normally there's an option to log in with any user and you could type "root" there to log in as root (strongly not recommended!). You wouldn't need to delete other accounts for that
[09:53] <jargon> Ben64: this isn't a production machine. it's for testing purposes
[09:53] <Ben64> why test something terrible like that
[09:53] <tdn> rwsq1, but this is vbox 4.1.12
[09:53] <tdn> rwsq1, so it should not be affected by 4.2 bugs?
[09:53] <Ben64> jargon: shouldn't you be learning to do things the proper way
[09:53] <jargon> _blk: this is the server edition. sorry, i forgot to mention that. no gui
[09:53] <tdn> rwsq1, also, I have used virtualbox on 12.04 before. I just recently had to reinstall. And now it does not work.
[09:53] <_blk> jargon, on the console you can log in with any user anyway, no need to delete users for that first
[09:53] <layke> Hi. I'm finding it impossible to use chrome on my fresh 14.04 install. I notice xorg and chrome seem to run at 100% CPU and I end up having 4-8 seconds inbetween any user input and mouse clicks
[09:54] <jargon> _blk: good point
[09:54] <jargon> thanks!
[09:54] <_blk> jargon, you may want to set root's password first!
[09:54] <rwsq1> tdn, it could be that the 12.04 kernel has changed in recent releases and this has caused incompatibility with virtualbox - you would need to check the changelog
[09:54] <jargon> _blk: i already did :-)
[09:54] <Ben64> jargon: alternatively, learn how to use sudo properly
[09:55] <_blk> jargon, I would go with Ben64's suggestion to use sudo
[09:55] <_blk> use sudo -s to spawn a root shell
[09:55] <Ben64> or just leave the channel : /

[10:19] <MickeyDroid> bazhang: No error pops up in dmesg
[10:19] <mharris> Akiraa: It can work in theory, modulo X server and video driver bugs, BIOS glitches and other factors that can be very specific to the motherboard/video card combination, so no universal answer, but in theory X is designed to handle it.

[10:37] <last_staff> anybody know what I can have done?
[10:38] <Fuchs> last_staff: 1) are you running a graphical environment?   2) how exactly are you trying to run it? As a different user? (including root / sudo)
[10:43] <Kopfgeldjaeger> Hi. I get a segfault when upgrading bash to 4.3-7ubuntu1.4 on ubuntu 14.04: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg received a segmentation fault. does anybody know a solution?
[10:44] <MickeyDroid> what method did u use to update Bash??
[10:44] <Kopfgeldjaeger> apt-get dist-upgrade/upgrade

[10:45] <root> hello
[10:45] <MickeyDroid> that command upgrades the whole ubuntu right??

[10:45] <Guest24426> hmm
[10:45] <Kopfgeldjaeger> All packages, yes
[10:45] <Ben64> Kopfgeldjaeger: pastebin the output of both "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"

[10:51] <last_staff> Fuchs: xubuntu desktop, trying to run 'sudo synaptic' with the user vagrant in the sudoers file and a member of the sudo group
[10:54] <BluesKaj> HIya folks
[10:56] <Fuchs> last_staff: do not run graphical applications with sudo
[10:56] <Fuchs> last_staff: this should not be needed, policykit will take care of permissions
[10:56] <last_staff> Fuchs: by the way, I tried running it from the terminal
[10:57] <Fuchs> that should not be an issue, unless by terminal you mean a VT, then you'd have to specify the DISPLAY variable  (and it would be a bit pointless)
[10:57] <last_staff> can't launch it from the menu, since nothing happens
[10:57] <last_staff> well
[10:57] <last_staff> except the password thing
[10:58] <last_staff> authentication dialog pops up -> enter the password -> click Authenticate -> then, nothing
[10:58] <Fuchs> right, then running it from a terminal is a good idea, just do it without sudo, b
[10:58] <Fuchs> *because as said, policykit should do the auth thing
[10:59] <last_staff> Starting "Synaptic Package Manager" without administrative privileges
[11:00] <last_staff> so I get the synaptic window up, but that's about it. I can't install any packages or anything
[11:00] <Fuchs> what version of ubuntu is that?
[11:00] <last_staff> which is what it's for
[11:01] <last_staff> 14.04
[11:02] <Fuchs> last_staff: can you try with pkexec?
[11:02] <Fuchs> (instead of sudo)
[11:06] <test> are there any ubuntu tools to grab the posts to a google group and save them as a text file, any suggestions
[11:10] <last_staff> Fuchs: "(synaptic:3787): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: :0.0"
[11:10] <last_staff> i.e., same as with sudo
[11:10] <last_staff> there's also
[11:10] <last_staff> "No protocol specified", and
[11:10] <last_staff> "error: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not set in the environment."
[11:11] <last_staff> x d, not smileyface

[11:14] <last_staff> ...hmmm
[11:14] <last_staff> xdg_runtime_dir gives me /run/user/1000
[11:18] <Fuchs> last_staff: is your user the one with id 1000,
[11:19] <Fuchs> last_staff: plus does env  (the command) list the DISPLAY variable,
[11:19] <Fuchs> last_staff: plus if you already launched several commands with sudo: make sure that files in your home, especially hidden ones such as .XAuthority, belong to the correct user, not root. Fix if needed.
[11:20] <last_staff> Fuchs: according to the advanced user settings, the user has User ID 1000
[11:20] <last_staff> Fuchs: env and sudo env both list DISPLAY=:0.0
[11:21] <last_staff> eh...how do I chown, again?
[11:21] <last_staff> I've rarely had the need for it
[11:22] <blackyboy> Hi everyone i want to redierct http to https and if some one access in mysite.com it want to forward to www.mysite.com this both want to be done for my domain but i have done the mysite.com to www.mysite.com but i cant redirect my http to https if i enable the virtual host redirect rule for http to https page not getting loaded.  im using apache2 in ubuntu server 14.04LTS here is my virtualhost entry in pastebin http://paste.ubuntu.com/8454609/

[11:23] <LainProtocol7> blackyboy: You're rewriting to http://, not https://
[11:24] <last_staff> oh, /u means file/directory
[11:24] <LainProtocol7> blackyboy: Should be:     RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.%{HTTP_HOST} [R=301,L]
[11:24] <k1l> last_staff: "sudo chown user:user file"
[11:25] <LainProtocol7> blackyboy: That's presuming the other bits are correct. I just used: https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/RewriteHTTPToHTTPS for my webserver
[11:26] <blackyboy> ok let me try the above link
[11:26] <last_staff> k1l: thanks, I did a "sudo chown vagrant:vagrant /home/vagrant"
[11:27] <k1l> last_staff: that is not enough. you need to specify the files like .Xauthority
=== PsiOmega is now known as AlphaBeta
[11:28] <Fuchs> last_staff: or use the -R flag, but as that will affect all files and is not undoable: I don't recommend it. If it's only some (1-3) files: just specify them manually
[11:28] <Fuchs> ls -al  should list them
[11:28] <last_staff> k1l: I meant "sudo chown vagrant:vagrant -hR..."
[11:28] <last_staff> oh, I shouldn't do that?
[11:29] <Fuchs> well, I personally wouldn't recommend it
[11:29] <last_staff> ....vagrant destroy && vagrant up
[11:29] <test> thanks
[11:29] <Fuchs> as there might be files under your home folder that should belong to someone else
[11:29] <BobBall> Hi - can I install Ubuntu trusty including -updates somehow?  I'm doing a netboot install so ideally if there was a d-i setting I can twizzle to make sure it uses the -updates repo to download the very latest kernel etc it'd be great...
[11:29] <k1l> last_staff: well, be very careful with -R
[11:29] <Fuchs> but if you already did it: meh.  Try if pkexec thingie works now
[11:29] <Fuchs> and if yes: do not use sudo with graphical applications again :)
[11:29] <abaday> Hi, Im having trouble escaping the '. echo 'for RAN in $(su - rancid -c 'echo HEJ'); do RANCID=$RAN; done'
[11:30] <abaday> I want the output to be exactly: for RAN in $(su - rancid -c 'echo HEJ'); do RANCID=$RAN; done
[11:30] <blackyboy> LainProtocol7: i have used the above link but still i cant forward to https page not loading , but URL shows as https://mysite.com
[11:30] <last_staff> well what about when I'm forced to?
[11:30] <abaday> instead im getting for RAN in $(su - rancid -c echo HEJ); do RANCID=$RAN; done
[11:30] <last_staff> I mean "forced to"
[11:30] <abaday> note there is no '' around my echo HEJ in the output. which i need to have
[11:31] <Fuchs> last_staff: you shouldn't be
[11:31] <Fuchs> last_staff: if, you can install and use something such as gksudo. Or check if policykit  (pkexec) does the job
[11:32] <k1l> last_staff: you are not forced to run gui with sudo.
[11:32] <LainProtocol7> blackyboy: So it forwards to https, but then there's an issue?
[11:33] <last_staff> k1l: yeah I know, that's why I put it in quotation marks right afterwards
[11:33] <blackyboy> LainProtocol7: yes page not loading may be my ssl configuration was not good means how can i troubleshoot it
[11:33] <last_staff> basically I want to run synaptic instead of sudo apt-get whatever
[11:34] <LainProtocol7> blackyboy: SSL certificates tend to be valid for domain.com, OR www.domain.com, unless you have a wildcard certificate. If so, you shouldn't set an alias for the *.443 domain, and instead you should catch requests and forward them on to the domain you're primarily using
[11:35] <brontosaurusrex> abaday: try #bash
[11:35] <blackyboy> yes its wildcard certificate
[11:35] <k1l> last_staff: again, dont use sudo. we have gksu or gksudo for that. but synaptic should provide an request for entering the pw when started as regular program
[11:36] <LainProtocol7> blackyboy: Not sure then, you'd need to look in your log files to see what error Apache is reporting
[11:36] <last_staff> k1l: and it does. Only, after the password has been entered, the main window is never displayed
[11:37] <rwsq1> tdn - I would imagine that it will upgrade to that version and rebuild the dkms but you could remove the old one first if you want
[11:37] <last_staff> k1l: and apparently it's crashed, because I can't see the program in the task manager (including all users)
=== AlphaBeta is now known as PsiOmega
[11:37] <LainProtocol7> blackyboy: My Virtualhost has a line for "SSLCertificateChainFile" where I specify the Certificate chain bundle, which yours is missing
[11:37] <LainProtocol7> blackyboy: Don't know if this is mandatory though
[11:39] <blackyboy> LainProtocol7: just now i have tried the chain file in .pem format still its showing error wait let me look into logs
[11:39] <last_staff> huh.....
[11:39] <last_staff> log out -> log in
[11:39] <LainProtocol7> blackyboy: You also haven't specified the SSL protocols you'll accept, or the ciphers you accept. But again, not sure if these two lines are mandatory.
[11:40] <last_staff> k1l, Fuchs: logging out and logging back in....and synaptic is up again
[11:40] <last_staff> from the menu, with the authentication window and everything
[11:41] <Fuchs> Lovely :)
[11:41] <last_staff> sometimes.... >: (
[11:41] <Fuchs> so yes, in the future try to avoid sudo for graphical applications. Alternatives: see above
[11:42] <last_staff> so what you're saying is basically that when I start synaptic from the menu it's not sudoing, right?
[11:45] <EriC^^> last_staff: what menu
[11:47] <last_staff> EriC^^: application menu
[11:47] <Fuchs> last_staff: exactly, hence me asking what version you are using,
[11:47] <EriC^^> in unity?
[11:47] <EriC^^> last_staff: type grep -i exec /usr/share/applications/synaptic.desktop
[11:47] <Fuchs> last_staff: because ubuntu (fortunately) switched from gksu (and similar) to using policykit wherever possible
[11:49] <last_staff> EriC^^: Exec=synaptic-pkexec
[11:49] <EriC^^> same here
[11:49] <last_staff> I know it's telling me something...though I don't know what
[11:49] <EriC^^> you don't get a popup when you run it?

[11:51] <mehdi_> hey guys im having so much ram consumption  around 95% how can i manage it?
[11:51] <bazhang> check in top what they are mehdi_
[11:52] <Fuchs> mehdi_: see with something like htop or a process manager what takes it,
[11:52] <last_staff> mehdi_: install windows
[11:52] <cfhowlett> sleipnir, never heard of ubuntu  touching cmos ...
[11:52] <bazhang> last_staff, what?
[11:52] <Fuchs> mehdi_: do note that Linux uses available RAM for caching, this is on purpose and good.
[11:52] <last_staff> then you'll be up to 100% in no-time
[11:52] <bazhang> last_staff, thats not helpful
[11:52] <Fuchs> which is  http://www.linuxatemyram.com/  in detail

[11:53] <quietone> hi, just completed installing but bootloader failed and I don't know how to fix grub or boot to Ubuntu
[11:53] <sleipnir> cfhowlett, I am not saying that it does touch the CMOS necessraly, just that the only remedy is CMOS battery removale
[11:53] <cfhowlett> !grub | quietone
[11:53] <ubottu> quietone: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
[11:53] <bazhang> quietone, dual boot with win8?
[11:54] <mehdi_> i ran vbox and sqldeveloper  but i close them all only run firefox,rhythmbox, terminal,skype and geany
[11:54] <bazhang> mehdi_, did you check top as to what is consuming the most
[11:55] <quietone> cfhowlett, bazhang, no. Debian Jessie. I installed Ubuntu in a separate LVM partition on an encrypted drive.
[11:55] <quietone> I've mucked around with the Boot Repair disk but that kept failing
=== Joshua^Dunamis is now known as Joshua^Dunamis_i
[11:55] <bazhang> quietone, that extra info helps a lot
[11:55] <quietone> wanted me to stop package managers that were not running
[11:55] <Fuchs> mehdi_: I'd recommend using htop, because the colours will also show whether the RAM is really used or just for caching, which is explained above.
[11:56] <mehdi_> the application lock in the launchbar are using ram also?
[11:56] <quietone> bazhang, np. it's just that messing with Grub etc isn't my area of interest but I can't find suitable help either
[11:56] <bazhang> mehdi_, could be, what does top/htop show
[11:57] <last_staff> EriC^^: the grep command shows me the same thing as when before i logged out then back in, as expected
[11:57] <EriC^^> last_staff: what's going on?
[11:57] <EriC^^> i'm late to the party :)
[11:57] <bazhang> quietone, I'm not really up to speed on grub/lvm issues, there is the grub wiki above, and also #grub
[11:57] <Fuchs> last_staff: I assume that one of the files in your home belonged to the wrong user, which was an issue when you properly want to run a graphical application in context of another
=== neptune is now known as Guest1400
[12:00] <EriC^^> Fuchs: if he uses sudo synaptic to launch it, that could get root to own some files there
[12:00] <mehdi_> nautilus 1.3GB
[12:00] <Fuchs> EriC^^: he did, I told him it's a bad idea, we fixed permissions, it works again  (well, with policykit, which should be used)
[12:00] <last_staff> Fuchs: could it have something to do with user@hostname pointers?
[12:00] <mehdi_> compiz 1.9GB
[12:01] <Fuchs> last_staff: hard to say with it being as (non)verbose as it is. What you could have tried is debugging policykit when the error occurred, but that's usually not a fun thing to do. So unless you are bored ...
[12:01] <quietone> bazhang, thx. I've already skimmed those pages. I'll try #grub
[12:01] <last_staff> Fuchs: ...or pretty much dead-set on figuring out the root cause
=== john__ is now known as dull_john
=== xy is now known as Guest9033
=== dull_john is now known as roamer
[12:03] <Fuchs> last_staff: well yes, the root cause is running graphical (X11) applications with sudo, which should not be done, because with regular sudo  (not -i) the user environment is kept, hence files are written / modified in your home, some of them being core X stuff like .XAuthority
[12:03] <bazhang> mehdi_, so the system is very slow using unity then. perhaps try xubuntu/lubuntu on there
[12:03] <last_staff> EriC^^: The issue was solved, but I've yet to figure out what caused it. I know now what the effect of it is and how to solve it, just not the why and when it happens

[12:05] <roamer> Anyone?
[12:05] <last_staff> Fuchs: oooh~, bookmarked
[12:06] <Fuchs> last_staff: it also mentions gksu(do) I mentioned earlier. Note that this is no longer used (and installed) in recent ubuntu versions, but you can still install it
[12:06] <Fuchs> and if you happen to need a graphical application as root (which you usually don't. Exceptions, such as system settings or package managers, should use policykit these days), you can use that

=== gnu is now known as Guest98606
[12:10] <EriC^^> last_staff: it will list the difference between the environment when you run synaptic with those 2 commands, the first is gksu the second is sudo
[12:11] <last_staff> heh, now I get gksu: no such file or directory
[12:12] <quants> for some odd reason my laptop battery has stopped working. is there and not hardware reason why this might happen?
[12:12] <bazhang> !info gksu
[12:13] <ubottu> gksu (source: gksu): graphical frontend to su. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0.2-6ubuntu2 (trusty), package size 26 kB, installed size 172 kB
[12:13] <last_staff> I'm thinking though, that if I'd started out with building the kernel from scratch, like most of the linux geeks in my school (many years back), I'd know a bit more about the OS itself
[12:13] <EriC^^> last_staff: are you using a bash shell?
[12:14] <last_staff> um, I don't know anymore. could be dash
[12:14] <last_staff> lemme check
[12:14] <k1l> last_staff: i suggest you should start with reading about what you do instead of blindly entering some commands you found anywhere
[12:14] <k1l> !sudo | last_staff
[12:14] <ubottu> last_staff: sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (GNOME, Xfce), or !kdesudo (KDE). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo

[12:29] <ts_user> any idea of a command that would automatically mount any USB storage device after it's unmounted ?
[12:29] <ts_user> (I mean for an entry not present in fstab)
[12:30] <EriC^^> last_staff: when ubottu gave the bug report
[12:30] <last_staff> brb
[12:31] <roamer> EriC^^ : I have booted from livecd
[12:31] <EriC^^> roamer: ok, is this a efi machine btw?
[12:31] <ts_user> mount -a doesn't refresh USB :/
[12:31] <roamer> EriC^^ : yes
[12:32] <EriC^^> roamer: ok, type sudo parted -l
[12:32] <EriC^^> and get the disk and partition number of the efi partition, and your main ubuntu installation
[12:32] <roamer> EriC^^ : do you want the full table? should we private chat?
[12:33] <roamer> EriC^^ :  it is number 1 and 3
[12:33] <roamer> EriC^^ :  1 and 3 writes EFI system partition
[12:33] <ts_user> (it seems gvfs-mount doesn't refresh USB either....)
[12:33] <EriC^^> 1 *and* 3 ?

[12:37] <EriC^^> roamer: yes
[12:37] <EriC^^> roamer: it's weird that you have 2 efi partitions
[12:37] <EriC^^> usually 1 only is recommended
[12:38] <EriC^^> did you install ubuntu?
[12:38] <roamer> EriC^^ :  i used boot-repair... i think it did some of its magic there... : http://paste.ubuntu.com/8453292/

[12:57] <EriC^^> it's ok, it probably meant different ones
[12:57] <roamer> EriC^^ : rebooting?
[12:57] <EriC^^> yeah unless you want to make sure they unmounted
[12:58] <roamer> EriC^^ : grub rescue screen again
[12:58] <roamer> EriC^^ : :(
[13:00] <b0x> hola
[13:01] <EriC^^> roamer: maybe the bios is using the first efi partition?
[13:02] <roamer> EriC^^ : how is that possible?
[13:02] <EriC^^> it would make sense it would
[13:02] <roamer> EriC^^ : it didn't use to

[13:10] <drmagoo> sleipnir: what client are you using to ssh to the machine ?
[13:11] <zy3pDbot> hi
[13:11] <sleipnir> drmagoo, just ubuntu ssh
[13:12] <Dovid> How do I go abotu fixing this? It is an old server and I can't update bash
[13:12] <Dovid> http://pastebin.com/r60hrXNR
[13:12] <drmagoo> can you try "ssh -vvv user@host and provide a pastebin of the output ?
[13:13] <Dovid> drmagoo: Talking to me?
[13:13] <drmagoo> sorry, that was for sleipnir
[13:14] <drmagoo> sleipnir: can you try "ssh -vvv user@host" and provide a pastebin of the output ?
[13:14] <sleipnir> drmagoo, http://pastebin.com/q9iVwu4P
[13:14] <zy3pD> hi
[13:15] <sleipnir> drmagoo, the long wait happens after line 62 is displayed
[13:18] <sleipnir> drmagoo, the machine I am trying to reach is multihomed (if that matters)
[13:18] <roamer> EriC^^ : are you there? I have booted ubuntu from livecd
[13:18] <sleipnir> drmagoo, actually that might matter because the route command takes about the same amount of time to complete as the ssh connection
[13:19] <EriC^^> roamer: ok, sudo mount /dev/sda7 /mnt
[13:20] <roamer> EriC^^ : done
[13:21] <zy3pD> hi
[13:21] <roamer> EriC^^ : next?
[13:21] <EriC^^> roamer: sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/boot/efi
[13:21] <drmagoo> sleipnir: there is nothing really odd in that pastebin, that would point to a problem with the ssh-deamon on that machine.. There must be something else that causes that problem. is this a new issue or ?
[13:22] <zy3pDbot> hi @and 3 servers
[13:22] <roamer> EriC^^ : done... next?
[13:24] <sleipnir> drmagoo, yes this is a new issue. there was a power failure and now I have this
[13:24] <Laurenceb> hi
[13:24] <sleipnir> drmagoo, it responds the same on all interfaces
[13:25] <Laurenceb> i have a problem with samba printing
[13:25] <Laurenceb> the printer is shows 0 pages when i print a large document
[13:25] <Laurenceb> it seems to be related to the file size
[13:25] <Laurenceb> can anyone advise?
[13:25] <roamer> EriC^^ : by the way thank you for helping me. I really hope we can fix this issue. I really need this to work.
[13:26] <roamer> EriC^^ : can you tell me what the next step is please?
[13:26] <EriC^^> roamer: hold on
[13:29] <erobinson> !
[13:30] <EriC^^> roamer: trying to see how we can mount both efi's in the same place and install , mount --bind not working here
[13:30] <drmagoo> sleipnir: if you run "dmesg", do you any output about disc read/write errors ?
[13:31] <EriC^^> roamer: come to think of it, that sounds like a bad idea
[13:31] <sleipnir> drmagoo, the route problem dissapears if I do route -n (it reseolves quickly) my google foo implies that it means my network is having some problems with reverse DNS lookup.
[13:32] <sleipnir> drmagoo, I do not see any errors regarding IO error
[13:32] <EriC^^> roamer: i think we should try to reinstall the grub package

[13:32] <dualbootubuntu> hi, is it possible to install ubuntu to a connected secondary disk while I'm already running ubuntu? I got gparted to basically copy the partitions/types/flags etc of the first disk, just wondering how I would go about setting it up so that all I have to do is turn it off, change a cable and have the other disk boot up and not miss a beat
[13:32] <EriC^^> roamer: hold on
[13:33] <BobBall> dualbootubuntu: Have a look at debootstrap

[13:36] <drmagoo> sleipnir: and what do you have in /etc/resolv.conf
[13:36] <EriC^^> roamer: it's fine you are already using it i guess
[13:36] <roamer> EriC^^ : anyway... did what you told me... what should I do next?
[13:36] <EriC^^> roamer: mine's using it by default
[13:37] <EriC^^> roamer: did you install it?
[13:37] <roamer> EriC^^ : ok... what's next?
[13:37] <sleipnir> drmagoo, nameserver 127.0.0.1
[13:37] <EriC^^> what did it output?
[13:37] <drmagoo> sleipnir: do you have a local dns-server on that machine ? otherwise try to add "nameserver 8.8.8.8" as the first line in that file
[13:38] <roamer> EriC^^ : yes I have... awaiting further instructions...
[13:38] <EriC^^> roamer: in the end what did it say?
[13:38] <sleipnir> drmagoo, I do not have a local nameserver
[13:38] <roamer> EriC^^ : instalation finished. No error reported
[13:39] <EriC^^> roamer: type update-grub
[13:39] <drmagoo> sleipnir: do you have an internal dns-server on you network, use that.. else you google's (8.8.8.8)
[13:40] <roamer> EriC^^ : Done!
[13:41] <EriC^^> ok
[13:41] <EriC^^> type exit
[13:41] <roamer> EriC^^ : typed exit
[13:42] <EriC^^> ok btw when you type ls /boot/efi , you get some files right?
[13:42] <EriC^^> i mean
[13:42] <EriC^^> ls /mnt/boot/efi
[13:42] <roamer> EriC^^ : let me check
[13:43] <roamer> EriC^^ : yes I get Boot and EFI folders as well as bootmgr, BOOTNXT and BOOTSECT.BAK files
[13:43] <EriC^^> ok
[13:44] <EriC^^> sudo reboot
[13:45] <roamer> EriC^^ : same problem :(
=== csheldon_ is now known as Corey84
[13:45] <EriC^^> we can try mounting the 1st efi if you want
[13:45] <EriC^^> it might work
[13:45] <roamer> EriC^^ : ok... let us do that can we do that from grub rescue?
[13:45] <EriC^^> nope
[13:46] <EriC^^> livecd again
[13:47] <roamer> EriC^^ : can you please explain to me what is wrong and what we are trying to do?
[13:47] <EriC^^> roamer: i think the bios boots the first efi partition
[13:47] <EriC^^> and it finds grub there, but it is corrupt or something
[13:48] <roamer> EriC^^ : I see... I also read the following : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1289977/comments/35

[14:12] <ikonia> stangeland: take backups first
[14:13] <ikonia> stangeland: how safe it is depends on what software you have configured on it and what repos you are using
[14:13] <stangeland> ikonia, is it possible to easily just backuop the entire machine?
[14:13] <ikonia> I presonally don't like the  in place upgrades, but they can work ok
[14:13] <ikonia> stangeland: you can backup the whole machine or the file systems you want to use
[14:13] <stangeland> i would like to backup the whole machine basically
[14:13] <interweb> Hi , How can I install Gnome 3.14 on ubuntu 14.04 ? (with official PPA)
[14:14] <ikonia> interweb: configure ppa - install gnome3
[14:14] <somsip> sebastianlutter: isn't that something you can do via X over SSH? I have no experience of this but understand it does what you want
[14:14] <ikonia> stangeland: look up clonezilla, simple solution
[14:15] <AlexeyPetrenko> Hi all! How to force Mesa software rendering? Should I use environment variables from http://www.mesa3d.org/envvars.html
[14:15] <ikonia> AlexeyPetrenko: force it ?
[14:15] <ikonia> AlexeyPetrenko: let Xorg manage it
[14:15] <EriC^^> roamer: ?
[14:16] <interweb> ikonia, Any official PPA ?
[14:16] <AlexeyPetrenko> ikonia: Yes, I have VBox VM and it's emulated graphics support only Opengl 2.1. I need Opengl 3 and I know Mesa softpipe driver supports it
[14:16] <roamer> EriC^^ : sorry phone
[14:16] <ikonia> interweb: not that I'm aware of,
[14:17] <AlexeyPetrenko> ikonia: How do I configure my system so it uses software driver instead of VM's GPU
[14:17] <EriC^^> roamer: no problem
[14:17] <ikonia> AlexeyPetrenko: not sure actuually in that situation,
[14:17] <roamer> EriC^^ : so I did the chroot
[14:17] <__unik> can someone tell me what the hotkey for adding Shell tab in Yakuake
[14:17] <felon> question: how do i know if im using unity 2D or 3D special affects?
[14:17] <sebastianlutter> somsip, X can remote connect, also gdm/gnome has a vnc like mechanism. But the routing through subnet / router / firewall seems to be the bottleneck
[14:18] <sebastianlutter> Zerock|LittleRed, Thanks, you still using teamviewer?
[14:18] <EriC^^> roamer: try sudo apt-get install --reinstall grub-efi-amd64-signed
=== ljl_ is now known as LjL-GNOME
[14:18] <ikonia> AlexeyPetrenko: I think (I'll need to check this) there is an xorg module for it, so if you load that it should work, but I'll need to check this
[14:18] <wadie> Thank you Eric, it's much better now :D
[14:18] <wadie> :D
[14:18] <wadie> :D
[14:18] <AlexeyPetrenko> ikonia: It worked with other VM's where I just could disable 3D acceleration and use software emulation. But now it's boot2docker VM and I dont have control over it, so I want to make it inside ubuntu
[14:18] <EriC^^> wadie: great :)
[14:18] <sebastianlutter> OerHeks, you mean something like VNC over web (do not know if something like this exists, just to get your point)
[14:18] <Zerock|LittleRed> sebastianlutter: I'm not using any remote desktop software, since there isn't any that respects my freedom.
[14:19] <AlexeyPetrenko> ikonia: Yep, I'm sure it should be. Would be nice to know how to configure X this way.
[14:19] <Zerock|LittleRed> aren't any that respect*
[14:19] <EriC^^> wadie: it's not persistent though, if you want it you can make a script and add it to ~/.profile
[14:19] <sebastianlutter> Zerock|LittleRed, I feel the same way
[14:19] <ikonia> AlexeyPetrenko: you basically just do a "loadmod" in theh xorg.conf, but I'll need to check the info as I'm working from memory and not %100 sure I'm right
[14:19] <Zerock|LittleRed> sebastianlutter: I actually run Trisquel Mini on this machine.
[14:20] <Zerock|LittleRed> Ubuntu at work, and Parabola at home.
[14:20] <wadie> what do you mean not persistent ? :O how can I create that script ?
[14:20] <EriC^^> wadie: the last command btw for xrandr to switch the resolution is xrandr -s 1600x1200
[14:20] <wadie> I used xrandr VGA1 1600x1200 and it worked
[14:20] <EriC^^> wadie: yes also xrandr --output VGA1 1600x1200 works
[14:21] <wadie> so about that script
[14:21] <wadie> what does it include
[14:21] <sebastianlutter> Zerock|LittleRed, if all that ipv4 subnet / firewall / masquerating stuff would be replaced by ipv6 (a global accessible ip for any device) I guess VNC would do what I want.
[14:21] <EriC^^> take the commands and put them in a file, call it something, then chmod +x <script>
[14:22] <Zerock|LittleRed> sebastianlutter: Out of curiosity, what do you need the software for?
[14:22] <EriC^^> and in ~/.profile add "bash <script>"
[14:22] <wadie> you mean the xrandr things ?
[14:22] <EriC^^> wadie: yeah
[14:22] <Zerock|LittleRed> I did things the hard (read: easy) way, and switched my friends and family to GNU+Linux so I could use ssh.
[14:22] <wadie> so I'll create a bash script with the xrandr commands, move it to ~/.profile then chmod +x
[14:23] <EriC^^> wadie: put it anywhere you want, add the path to ~/.profile , bash /path/to/script
[14:23] <sebastianlutter> Zerock|LittleRed, my setup involves a gentoo with i3 wm and a ubuntu 14.04. I have a crawler for an research project running on my office ubuntu box. But I need about an hour from home to the office, and want to check If everything is well (and maybe restart things) without beeing forced to go there.
[14:23] <EriC^^> wadie: if you want you can call it ~/.resolution.sh so it'll be hidden
[14:24] <sebastianlutter> Zerock|LittleRed, it has some GUI elements, so ssh alone does not solve my problem, so VNC or something like this is needed
[14:27] <HoNgOuRu> hi, my system freezes sometimes after hitting the /home/user folder icon, sometimes it comes back to normality, some others don't.... my home folder /home is in an independent partition from the system.... should I check the partition for disk errors ? or what? I am running ubuntu 14.04... any help will be appreciated...btw, the system / was reformatted yesterday cause I had some laggy situations before...
[14:31] <wadie> Eric can you link me to a documentation online because I'm not really sure I'm doing it right
[14:31] <roamer> EriC^^ : sorry for late reply my internet connection was gone. can you please tell me the next step after apt-get install?
[14:32] <drmagoo> HoNgOuRu: sounds like disc issues, so a check would be a good idea
[14:33] <Abhijit> pppoe-setup says pppoe.conf not found. i did apt-get install pppoe but package is already installed. can not connect to dnl
[14:36] <HoNgOuRu> drmagoo, ok... do I have to be root? have the /home unmounted?
[14:36] <Abhijit> pppoeconf gives SIOCSIFFLAGS: Operation not possible due to RF-kill
[14:36] <adriennbox> hi everyone, i have no more mouse and internet on ubuntu 14.04
[14:36] <adriennbox> somebody know why?
[14:38] <varunendra> Abhijit, does this system have Network Manager installed? You can use that to set up a DSL connection.
[14:38] <Abhijit> varunendra, networkmanager also does not connect. hence I am here in irc.
[14:38] <LainProtocol7> adriennbox: 14.04 doesn't support mice or internet
[14:38] <drmagoo> HoNgOuRu: how proficient are you with linux ? For the best result you should boot from a livecd and run the scan from that.. Unless you are running some sort of encryption on that directory/disc
[14:38] <varunendra> adriennbox, since when do you have these absent?
[14:39] <adriennbox> since 3 days
[14:39] <HoNgOuRu> drmagoo, ok, I got it... I'll do that... shall I use fsck ?
[14:39] <adriennbox> i can reinstall but i dont want to lose file
[14:39] <varunendra> Abhijit, is the interface up? And are you trying this over wireless?
[14:39] <Abhijit> varunendra, for pppoe i got only ethernet cable. modem do not support mifi.
[14:40] <adriennbox> lainprotocol17 really? so i have to use another version?
=== carlos is now known as Guest30935
[14:40] <adriennbox> wich version?
[14:40] <Abhijit> varunendra, this is for railwire btw
[14:40] <EriC^^> roamer: sorry, im back
[14:40] <EriC^^> roamer: grub-install --recheck /dev/sda
[14:40] <HoNgOuRu> drmagoo, can I just logout from this session log as root unmount /home and do the same ?
[14:40] <varunendra> adriennbox, just ignore the "doesn't support" comment.
[14:40] <adriennbox> ok
[14:40] <EriC^^> wadie: sorry
[14:40] <EriC^^> wadie: can you pastebin your script?
[14:41] <varunendra> adriennbox, did it happen after an update or any particular development?
[14:41] <HoNgOuRu> roamer, I did that just yesterday
[14:41] <roamer> EriC^^ : welcome back, I have done as you asked no errors reported
[14:41] <HoNgOuRu> roamer, if you need a hand...
[14:41] <adriennbox> varunendra i dont remember sorry... but i use live ubuntu
[14:41] <adriennbox> my sister used live ubuntu instead
[14:41] <EriC^^> wadie: ~/.profile is a file, not a directory, add "bash ~/.resolution.sh" to the end of the file, if you named your script .resolution.sh in your home directory
[14:42] <varunendra> Abhijit, the "rfkill" thing only interferes with wireless devices. So that error is a bit confusing for me.
[14:42] <roamer> EriC^^ : what is the next step?
[14:42] <drmagoo> HoNgOuRu: I usually run it from a livecd, so that I am sure that there is nothing blocking/using that drive..
[14:42] <EriC^^> roamer: update-grub
[14:42] <HoNgOuRu> drmagoo, ok
[14:42] <varunendra> adriennbox, Live Ubuntu with persistence? (can preserve changes?)
[14:42] <HoNgOuRu> drmagoo, ok, thank you
[14:42] <roamer> EriC^^ : so finished that too
[14:43] <roamer> EriC^^ : next?
[14:43] <EriC^^> roamer: grep -i highlight /etc/default/grub
[14:43] <EriC^^> roamer: does it return anything?
[14:44] <adriennbox> varunendra i guess no
[14:44] <varunendra> Abhijit, please give us a little detail of your setup. Generally, it is a telephone cable from the ISP that plugs into a DLS modem, then an Ethernet cable from the modem to the computer/network-switch
[14:44] <adriennbox> live ubuntu without save
[14:44] <roamer> EriC^^ : no it doesn't
[14:44] <EriC^^> roamer: ok, try sudo reboot
[14:44] <EriC^^> exit first
[14:45] <varunendra> adriennbox, if it can't save changes, then it boots with the default configuration everytime. Which means if it was working earlier, it should work on next boot too, unless there is a hardware change.
[14:45] <adriennbox> hmm
[14:45] <adriennbox> so i have to try normal boot after live boot?
[14:45] <Abhijit> varunendra, this is nothing to do with telephone. direct fibre optic cable. then modem. then rj45
[14:45] <Abhijit> varunendra, nothing else in the setup.
[14:45] <adriennbox> varunendra so i have to try normal boot after live boot?
[14:45] <roamer> EriC^^ : Same problem back in to grub rescue>
[14:46] <roamer> EriC^^ : :(
[14:46] <varunendra> adriennbox, please be specific on where you are having the problem - on a Live session or an installed instance (Ubuntu installed and running from Hard Disk)?
[14:46] <adriennbox> varuendnra it run from harddisk
[14:47] <adriennbox> varunendra after saw the problems (no mouse and no internet) i put the DVD and did live boot
[14:47] <varunendra> Abhijit, I'm not familiar with optic fibre connections, but is it different from a regular DSL connection where you need to dial the connection using a username and password?
[14:48] <varunendra> adriennbox, and the problem is same in both the Live session and the installed one?
[14:48] <Abhijit> varunendra, no different. its just dsl only.
[14:48] <adriennbox> varunendra nope, live session work very well (mouse and internet) but run from hard ware no mouse and no internet...
[14:49] <EriC^^> roamer: if you press esc when the pc boots
[14:50] <EriC^^> do you get a boot options menu
[14:50] <felon> ubuntu 14.04 LTS runs so smooth ... glad i formatted and did a fresh upgrade install.
[14:52] <varunendra> adriennbox, okay, then please boot into the installed version (hard disk) and try this first - "sudo modprobe -rv psmouse".... then.. "sudo modprobe -v psmouse". If this doesn't activate the mouse, run these commands in terminal - "xinput"... and .... "lsmod". Then upload their outputs to pastebin and give us the pastebin link.
[14:52] <adriennbox> oh nice
[14:52] <adriennbox> varunendra thx i try now
[14:53] <varunendra> Abhijit, thought so, since you were trying pppoe. Can you log into the modem interface and check if it (pppoe) can be configured there?
[14:54] <Abhijit> varunendra, i cant login. ethernet interface is not connected.
[14:55] <Battlecruiser> hi there
[14:55] <Battlecruiser> has anyone worked around the problem that wine and cuda 6.5 can't be installed together?
[14:55] <Battlecruiser> 'cause I need both things installed
[14:55] <varunendra> Abhijit, then getting the link up is the first problem, pppoe will come later. Please give us the pastebin links of the outputs of - "sudo lshw -C network" and "sudo ethtool eth0".
[14:56] <adriennbox> varunendra thx very much mouse is back, but no wifi...

[15:04] <roamer> EriC^^ : what shall i do?
[15:04] <hsnopi> Good morning all. There are a lot of access.log entries showing attempts to break in using the shellshock bug. It attempts to wget ec.z. I'm unable to locate anything regarding that. Does anyone know anything about it?
[15:04] <hsnopi> I had already updated my bash shells friday.
[15:06] <varunendra> adriennbox, Abhijit sorry went afk, an urgent call..
[15:06] <Abhijit> o
[15:06] <Abhijit> ok
[15:06] <varunendra> adriennbox, for wifi, please follow the instructions at this link and give us the report it asks for : http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=13024222
[15:06] <somsip> hsnopi: the attack approach I've read about is is to try to wget a dodgy file, then execute it which installs something more dodgy
[15:07] <hsnopi> yeah, that's what I'm seeing. Rkhunter shows no diffs but I'm not sure how to tell if the attack was successful
[15:07] <hsnopi> 74.201.85.69/ec.z is the main one I'm seeing on a few different machines
[15:08] <varunendra> Abhijit, please try this - "sudo ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full autoneg off". Does it get you connected to the modem? (can you ping it?)
[15:08] <hsnopi> I suppose since it was attempted muletiple times frto the same origination it's a sign it failed.
[15:08] <adriennbox> varunendra i try now
[15:09] <daftykins> hsnopi: perhaps the bash channel can shed some light, or channels of web servers
[15:09] <Abhijit> varunendra, bad command line argument
[15:09] <somsip> hsnopi: I see no payload in that file
[15:09] <hsnopi> somsip, agreed. I just wanted tomake sure. thanks.
[15:09] <somsip> hsnopi: np
[15:09] <varunendra> Abhijit, please copy-paste the command you tried.
[15:10] <Abhijit> varunendra, # ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full autoeng off
[15:12] <Abhijit> varunendra, corrected
[15:12] <varunendra> Abhijit, what was the error?

[15:42] <reisio> hi tick
[15:42] <ticket> since i upgraded to ubuntu 14 (from ubunto 12), i cant run the x seerver anymore :/
[15:42] <varunendra> jiohdi, the only thing that causes troubles for me is "two-step-verification" feature of google, where we need to generate an "application password" for specific applications like chat clients. If you haven't enabled 2-step-verification, I can't guess what else could be causing the error (apart from a typo of course).
[15:42] <ticket> i now only have the tty to use my ubuntu

[15:44] <reisio> holden87: a table
[15:44] <varunendra> jiohdi, if you're not sure, then you don't have it enabled. Google enables it only if opted-in.
[15:45] <adriennbox> varunendra thx i did it
[15:45] <reisio> holden87: 'prolonged support' is code for "I will be lazy to the point of not updating for longer than five whole years", right?

[15:46] <varunendra> jiohdi, in this kind of verification, you can authenticate specific systems so that you can log into google account ONLY from THOSE systems. If you try to log on from another system, google sends you a verification code on your mobile.

[17:29] <ticket> the xsession-errors has few lines
[17:29] <daftykins> Erto: if the disk is in warranty, you could RMA it
[17:29] <AlexPortable> daftykins: well if my disk is about to die, live session will kill it
[17:29] <daftykins> AlexPortable: no, no it won't
[17:30] <ticket> openConnection : connect: no file or folder like this, cannot connect to brltty at :0
[17:30] <AlexPortable> daftykins: whyn ot?
[17:30] <daftykins> AlexPortable: what part of booting a live session from a DVD or USB flash drive do you consider to affect a hard disk?
[17:31] <AlexPortable> it turns on
[17:32] <daftykins> AlexPortable: that's not how it works. boot a live session, install smartmontools and pastebinit, then run "sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | pastebinit"
[17:33] <drmagoo> ticket: check "dpkg --get-selections | grep ubuntu-session" if that is installed do a dpkg-reconfigure on it.. if its is not installed, install it =)
[17:33] <AlexPortable> ok

[17:48] <demahum12> Is there anyone who knows how these things with Munich City and Limux (forked from Ubuntu) finished. I know that they decided to call IT staff to reconsider using Linux since many of the users complained. I can't find what happened. Is there anyone who knows more recent details about this?
[17:50] <Samopotamus> loa, hah, no problem.
[17:51] <daftykins> demahum12: this channel is for ubuntu support, nothing to do with anything beyond that.

[17:57] <daftykins> AlexPortable: you have 1 pending sector and 2 reallocated, as per lines 58 and 59. no way of telling if that happened now, but i would backup the data, zero the entire drive with a manufacturer tool (or use 'dd') then restore your backup

[18:04] <dalekusa> I need help installing Ubuntu from a DVD.
[18:04] <bubbasaures> catern, The mini or lubuntu
[18:04] <catern> bubbasaures: those are my only options?
[18:04] <xangua> catern: no, but lubuntu still fits on a CD
[18:05] <catern> lxde is so ugly, so I'll go with mini
[18:05] <dalekusa> After I pull up the purple menu and select the try ubuntu option, it just goes to a blank screen
[18:05] <bubbasaures> catern, With ubuntu and a cd load yes.
[18:05] <drmagoo> rlinx: how long have it been hung ? have you checked top to see if there is any process that hogs the cpu ?
[18:05] <catern> bubbasaures: xangua: thanks.
[18:05]  * dalekusa tried with both 64 and 32-bit images, and it doesn't work either way
[18:06] <dalekusa> I have Linux Mint
[18:06] <bubbasaures> catern, If you have grub now you can boot the iso from it.

[18:11] <dalekusa> after the splash it turned blank again

[18:11] <daftykins> if you're booting from DVD, which is horrible in 2014 btw, it's probably going to take a while.

[18:12] <tgm4883> On 14.04, I installed Kubuntu, but then installed Ubuntu-desktop. Everything works fine, but my menu's are a bit difficult to read (see http://ibin.co/1c1MMeOAneJZ ) and I can't find a way to resolve this
[18:12] <Noiro> uhhh, where can I get a cross compiler compatible for sfml 2.1?
[18:12] <daftykins> dalekusa: and USB flash drive, please! :)
[18:13] <dalekusa> I don't think that my PC can USB boot
[18:13] <thurstylark> trism: Ahh! Yes! So, what reprecussions should I expect from removing libpam-smbpass?
[18:13] <dalekusa> and it has booted!
[18:13] <Jordan_U> dalekusa: How old is this machine?
[18:13] <thurstylark> or should I look at removing smb server alltogether? I'm definetly not using it...

[18:14] <daftykins> dalekusa: ok that's not the end of it, ideally you need to identify what graphics hardware it uses and install proper drivers (if needed) after installing
[18:14] <drmagoo> tgm4883: what do you mean by hard to read. In that picture some options like "Full screen" are "greyed out" and that is why it looks like that. You cannot select that option
[18:14] <trism> thurstylark: yeah if you are not using it, there aren't any problems really, the bug has a few comments detailing the issues it can cause if you are using it

[18:16] <drmagoo> tgm4883: hmm... have you made any other changes? like installed any new themes ?

[18:19] <Wulframn> tgm4883: understand that this is the ubuntu support room and kubuntu support is #kubuntu. Since you're using ubuntu-desktop in kubuntu your mileage may vary
[18:19] <tgm4883> Wulframn: but I'm not using kubuntu, I'm using ubuntu-desktop now
[18:20] <Wulframn> tgm4883: what was the base system you installed?
[18:20] <tgm4883> kubuntu
[18:20] <Wulframn> Right
[18:20] <Pici> Wulframn: Kubuntu is just Ubuntu with KDE installed by default instead of Unity.  tgm4883 is in the right place for support.
[18:21] <tgm4883> Wulframn: you do realize that Kubuntu is just a base ubuntu install with KDE and such packages. While Ubuntu is a base ubuntu install with Unity and such packages
[18:21] <Wulframn> Pici: I've previously been yelled at for suggesting that so I apologise, I must just be behind the policy here
[18:21] <Wulframn> tgm4883: I understand the differences.
